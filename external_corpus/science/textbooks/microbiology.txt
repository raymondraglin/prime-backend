        Sigma Xi Eye on Ethics. This unique feature,
        which appears in most chapters, explores an
        ethical issue related to chapter content.
        Developed in cooperation with the scientific
        research society Sigma Xi, each Eye on Ethics
        box presents students with a challenging ethical
        dilemma that arises at the intersection of science
        and healthcare. Often grounded in historical or
        current events, these short essays discuss
        multiple sides of an issue, posing questions that
        challenge the reader to contemplate the ethical
        principles that govern professionals in healthcare
        and the sciences.
        Disease Profile. This feature, which is exclusive
        to Chapters 21-26, highlights important
        connections between related diseases. Each box
        also includes a table cataloguing unique aspects
        of each disease, such as the causative agent,
        symptoms, portal of entry, mode of transmission,
        and treatment. These concise tables serve as a
        useful reference that students can use as a study
        aid.
        Link to Learning. This feature provides a brief
        introduction and a link to an online resource that
        students may use to further explore a topic
        presented in the chapter. Links typically lead to a
        website, interactive activity, or animation that
        students can investigate on their own.

An Invisible World

FIGURE 1.1 A veterinarian gets ready to clean a sea turtle covered in oil following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in
2010. After the spill, the population of a naturally occurring oil-eating marine bacterium called Alcanivorax borkumensis skyrocketed,
helping to get rid of the oil. Scientists are working on ways to genetically engineer this bacterium to be more efficient in cleaning up future
spills. (credit: modification of work by NOAA's National Ocean Service)

CHAPTER OUTLINE
1.1 What Our Ancestors Knew
1.2 A Systematic Approach
1.3 Types of Microorganisms
INTRODUCTION From boiling thermal hot springs to deep beneath the Antarctic ice, microorganisms can be found
almost everywhere on earth in great quantities. Microorganisms (or microbes, as they are also called) are small
organisms. Most are so small that they cannot be seen without a microscope.
Most microorganisms are harmless to humans and, in fact, many are helpful. They play fundamental roles in
ecosystems everywhere on earth, forming the backbone of many food webs. People use them to make biofuels,
medicines, and even foods. Without microbes, there would be no bread, cheese, or beer. Our bodies are filled with
microbes, and our skin alone is home to trillions of them.1 Some of them we can't live without; others cause
diseases that can make us sick or even kill us.
Although much more is known today about microbial life than ever before, the vast majority of this invisible world
remains unexplored. Microbiologists continue to identify new ways that microbes benefit and threaten humans.

    1.1 What Our Ancestors Knew

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe how our ancestors improved food with the use of invisible microbes
        · Describe how the causes of sickness and disease were explained in ancient times, prior to the invention

            of the microscope
        · Describe key historical events associated with the birth of microbiology

      CLINICAL FOCUS

      Part 1

      Cora, a 41-year-old lawyer and mother of two, has recently been experiencing severe headaches, a high fever,
      and a stiff neck. Her husband, who has accompanied Cora to see a doctor, reports that Cora also seems
      confused at times and unusually drowsy. Based on these symptoms, the doctor suspects that Cora may have
      meningitis, a potentially life-threatening infection of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

      Meningitis has several potential causes. It can be brought on by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or even a reaction to
      medication or exposure to heavy metals. Although people with viral meningitis usually heal on their own,
      bacterial and fungal meningitis are quite serious and require treatment.

      Cora's doctor orders a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to take three samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from
      around the spinal cord (Figure 1.2). The samples will be sent to laboratories in three different departments for
      testing: clinical chemistry, microbiology, and hematology. The samples will first be visually examined to
      determine whether the CSF is abnormally colored or cloudy; then the CSF will be examined under a microscope
      to see if it contains a normal number of red and white blood cells and to check for any abnormal cell types. In
      the microbiology lab, the specimen will be centrifuged to concentrate any cells in a sediment; this sediment will
      be smeared on a slide and stained with a Gram stain. Gram staining is a procedure used to differentiate between
      two different types of bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative).
      About 80% of patients with bacterial meningitis will show bacteria in their CSF with a Gram stain.2 Cora's Gram
      stain did not show any bacteria, but her doctor decides to prescribe her antibiotics just in case. Part of the CSF
      sample will be cultured--put in special dishes to see if bacteria or fungi will grow. It takes some time for most
      microorganisms to reproduce in sufficient quantities to be detected and analyzed.

          · What types of microorganisms would be killed by antibiotic treatment?

Most people today, even those who know very little about microbiology, are familiar with the concept of microbes, or
"germs," and their role in human health. Schoolchildren learn about bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms,
and many even view specimens under a microscope. But a few hundred years ago, before the invention of the
microscope, the existence of many types of microbes was impossible to prove. By definition, microorganisms, or
microbes, are very small organisms; many types of microbes are too small to see without a microscope, although
some parasites and fungi are visible to the naked eye.
Humans have been living with--and using--microorganisms for much longer than they have been able to see them.
Historical evidence suggests that humans have had some notion of microbial life since prehistoric times and have
used that knowledge to develop foods as well as prevent and treat disease. In this section, we will explore some of
the historical applications of microbiology as well as the early beginnings of microbiology as a science.

Fermented Foods and Beverages

People across the world have enjoyed fermented foods and beverages like beer, wine, bread, yogurt, cheese, and
pickled vegetables for all of recorded history. Discoveries from several archeological sites suggest that even
prehistoric people took advantage of fermentation to preserve and enhance the taste of food. Archaeologists
studying pottery jars from a Neolithic village in China found that people were making a fermented beverage from
rice, honey, and fruit as early as 7000 BC.3
Production of these foods and beverages requires microbial fermentation, a process that uses bacteria, mold, or
yeast to convert sugars (carbohydrates) to alcohol, gases, and organic acids (Figure 1.3). While it is likely that people
first learned about fermentation by accident--perhaps by drinking old milk that had curdled or old grape juice that
had fermented--they later learned to harness the power of fermentation to make products like bread, cheese, and
wine.

    The Iceman and Evidence of Early Treatments

    Prehistoric humans had a very limited understanding of the causes of disease, and various cultures developed
    different beliefs and explanations. While many believed that illness was punishment for angering the gods or was
    simply the result of fate, archaeological evidence suggests that prehistoric people attempted to treat illnesses and
    infections. One example of this is Ötzi the Iceman, a 5300-year-old mummy found frozen in the ice of the Ötzal Alps
    on the Austrian-Italian border in 1991. Because Ötzi was so well preserved by the ice, researchers discovered that
    he was infected with the eggs of the parasite Trichuris trichiura, which may have caused him to have abdominal pain
    and anemia. Researchers also found evidence of Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease.4 Some
    researchers think Ötzi may have been trying to treat his infections with the woody fruit of the Fomitopsis betulinus
    fungus, which was discovered tied to his belongings.5 This fungus has both laxative and antibiotic properties. Ötzi
    was also covered in tattoos that were made by cutting incisions into his skin, filling them with herbs, and then
    burning the herbs.6 There is speculation that this may have been another attempt to treat his health ailments.

    Early Notions of Disease, Contagion, and Containment

    Several ancient civilizations appear to have had some understanding that disease could be transmitted by things
    they could not see. This is especially evident in historical attempts to contain the spread of disease. For example,
    the Bible refers to the practice of quarantining people with leprosy and other diseases, suggesting that people
    understood that diseases could be communicable. Ironically, while leprosy is communicable, it is also a disease that
    progresses slowly. This means that people were likely quarantined after they had already spread the disease to
    others.

    Clean water and sanitation are among the most important elements of healthy societies. The earliest examples of
    urban sanitation systems are from the ancient Indus Valley Civilization cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, located
    in current-day Pakistan. Constructed in 2500 BCE (about 4,500 years ago), the cities had complex networks of
    wells, baths, and drainage systems that stored fresh water and carried waste away. About two thousand years later,
    people in the ancient Greek civilization attributed disease to bad air, mal'aria, which they called "miasmatic odors."
    They developed hygiene practices that built on this idea. In Rome, they built aqueducts, which brought fresh water
    into the city, and a giant sewer, the Cloaca Maxima, which carried waste away and into the river Tiber (Figure 1.4).
    Some researchers believe that this infrastructure helped protect the Romans from epidemics of waterborne
    illnesses.

Even before the invention of the microscope, some doctors, philosophers, and scientists made great strides in
understanding the invisible forces--what we now know as microbes--that can cause infection, disease, and death.
The Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BC) is considered the "father of Western medicine" (Figure 1.5). Unlike
many of his ancestors and contemporaries, he dismissed the idea that disease was caused by supernatural forces.
Instead, he posited that diseases had natural causes from within patients or their environments. Hippocrates and
his heirs are believed to have written the Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of texts that make up some of the oldest
surviving medical books.7 Hippocrates is also often credited as the author of the Hippocratic Oath, taken by new
physicians to pledge their dedication to diagnosing and treating patients without causing harm.

14  1 · An Invisible World

    While Hippocrates is considered the father of Western medicine, the Greek philosopher and historian Thucydides
    (460-395 BC) is considered the father of scientific history because he advocated for evidence-based analysis of
    cause-and-effect reasoning (Figure 1.5). Among his most important contributions are his observations regarding the
    Athenian plague that killed one-third of the population of Athens between 430 and 410 BC. Having survived the
    epidemic himself, Thucydides made the important observation that survivors did not get re-infected with the
    disease, even when taking care of actively sick people.8 This observation shows an early understanding of the
    concept of immunity.

    Marcus Terentius Varro (116-27 BC) was a prolific Roman writer who was one of the first people to propose the
    concept that things we cannot see (what we now call microorganisms) can cause disease (Figure 1.5). In Res
    Rusticae (On Farming), published in 36 BC, he said that "precautions must also be taken in neighborhood swamps
    . . . because certain minute creatures [animalia minuta] grow there which cannot be seen by the eye, which float in
    the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases."9

    Centuries later, Islamic scholars, mainly in Persia, built on the knowledge from Hippocrates as well as from Chinese
    and Indian medicine. Foremost among them was Ab Bakr al-Rz, usually refered to as al-Razi or by his Latinized
    name, Rhazes. He developed a range of experimental methods to test various aspects of medicine. For example, to
    select a location for a hospital, al-Razi hung raw meat around the city, and located the facility in the place where the
    meat took the longest to rot. He also was the first to distinguish measles and smallbox, and undertook experiments
    to determine which available treatments were most effective for each. While al-Razi did not have the technology to
    understand the role of microbes, his efforts to identify the causes of illnesses, rather than solely focusing on the
    symptoms, were highly influential.

    Islamic physicians created one of the most important medical texts in history, the Canon of Medicine (Arabic: al-
    Qnn f al-ibb). Compiled in 1025 by physician and philosopher Ibn Sina (often referred to as Avicenna), the
    encyclopedia included detailed descriptions of the parts of the body, a detailed account of over 800 medicinal
    substances, and pathologies of several illnesses organized by body part or health event. In the work, Ibn Sina
    described mechanisms of contagion, indicated that organisms could be infected by foreign substances, and that
    illness could be transmitted by breath. He is also credited with advancing the practice of isolating people who are
    sick, laying the foundation for historical and contemporary quarantine methods. The Canon was translated into
    many languages, and was a primary resource for teaching medicine around the world, through the Renaissance and
    beyond.

The Birth of Microbiology

While the ancients may have suspected the existence of invisible "minute creatures," it wasn't until the invention of
the microscope that their existence was definitively confirmed. While it is unclear who exactly invented the
microscope, a Dutch cloth merchant named Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was the first to develop a lens
powerful enough to view microbes. In 1675, using a simple but powerful microscope, Leeuwenhoek was able to
observe single-celled organisms, which he described as "animalcules" or "wee little beasties," swimming in a drop
of rain water. From his drawings of these little organisms, we now know he was looking at bacteria and protists. (We
will explore Leeuwenhoek's contributions to microscopy further in How We See the Invisible World.)

Nearly 200 years after van Leeuwenhoek got his first glimpse of microbes, the "Golden Age of Microbiology"
spawned a host of new discoveries between 1857 and 1914. Two famous microbiologists, Louis Pasteur and Robert
Koch, were especially active in advancing our understanding of the unseen world of microbes (Figure 1.6). Pasteur, a
French chemist, showed that individual microbial strains had unique properties and demonstrated that fermentation
is caused by microorganisms. He also invented pasteurization, a process used to kill microorganisms responsible for
spoilage, and developed vaccines for the treatment of diseases, including rabies, in animals and humans. Koch, a
German physician, was the first to demonstrate the connection between a single, isolated microbe and a known
human disease. For example, he discovered the bacteria that cause anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), cholera (Vibrio
cholera), and tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis).10 We will discuss these famous microbiologists, and
others, in later chapters.

FIGURE 1.6 (a) Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) is credited with numerous innovations that advanced the fields of microbiology and
immunology. (b) Robert Koch (1843-1910) identified the specific microbes that cause anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis.

As microbiology has developed, it has allowed the broader discipline of biology to grow and flourish in previously
unimagined ways. Much of what we know about human cells comes from our understanding of microbes, and many
of the tools we use today to study cells and their genetics derive from work with microbes.

            MICRO CONNECTIONS

    Microbiology Toolbox

    Because individual microbes are generally too small to be seen with the naked eye, the science of microbiology is
    dependent on technology that can artificially enhance the capacity of our natural senses of perception. Early
    microbiologists like Pasteur and Koch had fewer tools at their disposal than are found in modern laboratories,
    making their discoveries and innovations that much more impressive. Later chapters of this text will explore many
    applications of technology in depth, but for now, here is a brief overview of some of the fundamental tools of the
    microbiology lab.

        · Microscopes produce magnified images of microorganisms, human cells and tissues, and many other types of
            specimens too small to be observed with the naked eye.

        · Stains and dyes are used to add color to microbes so they can be better observed under a microscope. Some
            dyes can be used on living microbes, whereas others require that the specimens be fixed with chemicals or
            heat before staining. Some stains only work on certain types of microbes because of differences in their
            cellular chemical composition.

        · Growth media are used to grow microorganisms in a lab setting. Some media are liquids; others are more
            solid or gel-like. A growth medium provides nutrients, including water, various salts, a source of carbon (like
            glucose), and a source of nitrogen and amino acids (like yeast extract) so microorganisms can grow and
            reproduce. Ingredients in a growth medium can be modified to grow unique types of microorganisms.

        · A Petri dish is a flat-lidded dish that is typically 10-11 centimeters (cm) in diameter and 1-1.5 cm high. Petri
            dishes made out of either plastic or glass are used to hold growth media (Figure 1.7).

        · Test tubes are cylindrical plastic or glass tubes with rounded bottoms and open tops. They can be used to
            grow microbes in broth, or semisolid or solid growth media.

        · A Bunsen burner is a metal apparatus that creates a flame that can be used to sterilize pieces of equipment.
            A rubber tube carries gas (fuel) to the burner. In many labs, Bunsen burners are being phased out in favor of
            infrared microincinerators, which serve a similar purpose without the safety risks of an open flame.

        · An inoculation loop is a handheld tool that ends in a small wire loop (Figure 1.7). The loop can be used to
            streak microorganisms on agar in a Petri dish or to transfer them from one test tube to another. Before each
            use, the inoculation loop must be sterilized so cultures do not become contaminated.

1.2 A Systematic Approach

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe how microorganisms are classified and distinguished as unique species
    · Compare historical and current systems of taxonomy used to classify microorganisms

Once microbes became visible to humans with the help of microscopes, scientists began to realize their enormous
diversity. Microorganisms vary in all sorts of ways, including their size, their appearance, and their rates of
reproduction. To study this incredibly diverse new array of organisms, researchers needed a way to systematically
organize them.

The Science of Taxonomy

Taxonomy is the classification, description, identification, and naming of living organisms. Classification is the
practice of organizing organisms into different groups based on their shared characteristics. The most famous early
taxonomist was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician named Carolus Linnaeus (1701-1778). In 1735,
Linnaeus published Systema Naturae, an 11-page booklet in which he proposed the Linnaean taxonomy, a system of
categorizing and naming organisms using a standard format so scientists could discuss organisms using consistent
terminology. He continued to revise and add to the book, which grew into multiple volumes (Figure 1.8).

FIGURE 1.8 Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician Carolus Linnaeus developed a new system for categorizing plants and animals. In
this 1853 portrait by Hendrik Hollander, Linnaeus is holding a twinflower, named Linnaea borealis in his honor.

In his taxonomy, Linnaeus divided the natural world into three kingdoms: animal, plant, and mineral (the mineral
kingdom was later abandoned). Within the animal and plant kingdoms, he grouped organisms using a hierarchy of
increasingly specific levels and sublevels based on their similarities. The names of the levels in Linnaeus's original
taxonomy were kingdom, class, order, family, genus (plural: genera), and species. Species was, and continues to be,
the most specific and basic taxonomic unit.

Evolving Trees of Life (Phylogenies)
With advances in technology, other scientists gradually made refinements to the Linnaean system and eventually
created new systems for classifying organisms. In the 1800s, there was a growing interest in developing taxonomies
that took into account the evolutionary relationships, or phylogenies, of all different species of organisms on earth.
One way to depict these relationships is via a diagram called a phylogenetic tree (or tree of life). In these diagrams,
groups of organisms are arranged by how closely related they are thought to be. In early phylogenetic trees, the
relatedness of organisms was inferred by their visible similarities, such as the presence or absence of hair or the
18  1 · An Invisible World

    number of limbs. Now, the analysis is more complicated. Today, phylogenic analyses include genetic, biochemical,
    and embryological comparisons, as will be discussed later in this chapter.

    Linnaeus's tree of life contained just two main branches for all living things: the animal and plant kingdoms. In 1866,
    Ernst Haeckel, a German biologist, philosopher, and physician, proposed another kingdom, Protista, for unicellular
    organisms (Figure 1.9). He later proposed a fourth kingdom, Monera, for unicellular organisms whose cells lack
    nuclei, like bacteria.

    FIGURE 1.9 Ernst Haeckel's rendering of the tree of life, from his 1866 book General Morphology of Organisms, contained three kingdoms:
    Plantae, Protista, and Animalia. He later added a fourth kingdom, Monera, for unicellular organisms lacking a nucleus.

    Nearly 100 years later, in 1969, American ecologist Robert Whittaker (1920-1980) proposed adding another
    kingdom--Fungi--in his tree of life. Whittaker's tree also contained a level of categorization above the kingdom
    level--the empire or superkingdom level--to distinguish between organisms that have membrane-bound nuclei in
    their cells (eukaryotes) and those that do not (prokaryotes). Empire Prokaryota contained just the Kingdom
    Monera. The Empire Eukaryota contained the other four kingdoms: Fungi, Protista, Plantae, and Animalia.
    Whittaker's five-kingdom tree was considered the standard phylogeny for many years.

    Figure 1.10 shows how the tree of life has changed over time. Note that viruses are not found in any of these trees.
    That is because they are not made up of cells and thus it is difficult to determine where they would fit into a tree of
    life.

  Antibiotic drugs are specifically designed to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. But after a couple of days on
  antibiotics, Cora shows no signs of improvement. Also, her CSF cultures came back from the lab negative. Since
  bacteria or fungi were not isolated from Cora's CSF sample, her doctor rules out bacterial and fungal meningitis.
  Viral meningitis is still a possibility.
  However, Cora now reports some troubling new symptoms. She is starting to have difficulty walking. Her muscle
  stiffness has spread from her neck to the rest of her body, and her limbs sometimes jerk involuntarily. In
  addition, Cora's cognitive symptoms are worsening. At this point, Cora's doctor becomes very concerned and

The Role of Genetics in Modern Taxonomy
Haeckel's and Whittaker's trees presented hypotheses about the phylogeny of different organisms based on readily
observable characteristics. But the advent of molecular genetics in the late 20th century revealed other ways to
organize phylogenetic trees. Genetic methods allow for a standardized way to compare all living organisms without
20  1 · An Invisible World

    relying on observable characteristics that can often be subjective. Modern taxonomy relies heavily on comparing the
    nucleic acids (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] or ribonucleic acid [RNA]) or proteins from different organisms. The more
    similar the nucleic acids and proteins are between two organisms, the more closely related they are considered to
    be.

    In the 1970s, American microbiologist Carl Woese discovered what appeared to be a "living record" of the evolution
    of organisms. He and his collaborator George Fox created a genetics-based tree of life based on similarities and
    differences they observed in the gene sequences coding for small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of different
    organisms. In the process, they discovered that a certain type of bacteria, called archaebacteria (now known simply
    as archaea), were significantly different from other bacteria and eukaryotes in terms of their small subunit rRNA
    gene sequences. To accommodate this difference, they created a tree with three Domains above the level of
    Kingdom: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (Figure 1.11). Analysis of small subunit rRNA gene sequences suggests
    archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes all evolved from a common ancestral cell type. The tree is skewed to show a
    closer evolutionary relationship between Archaea and Eukarya than they have to Bacteria.

    FIGURE 1.11 Woese and Fox's phylogenetic tree contains three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Domains Archaea and Bacteria
    contain all prokaryotic organisms, and Eukarya contains all eukaryotic organisms. (credit: modification of work by Eric Gaba)

    Scientists continue to use analysis of RNA, DNA, and proteins to determine how organisms are related. One
    interesting, and complicating, discovery is that of horizontal gene transfer--when a gene of one species is absorbed
    into another organism's genome. Horizontal gene transfer is especially common in microorganisms and can make it
    difficult to determine how organisms are evolutionarily related. Consequently, some scientists now think in terms of
    "webs of life" rather than "trees of life."

    Naming Microbes
    In developing his taxonomy, Linnaeus used a system of binomial nomenclature, a two-word naming system for
    identifying organisms by genus and specific epithet. For example, modern humans are in the genus Homo and have
    the specific epithet name sapiens, so their scientific name in binomial nomenclature is Homo sapiens. In binomial
    nomenclature, the genus part of the name is always capitalized; it is followed by the specific epithet name, which is
    not capitalized. Both names are italicized. When referring to the species of humans, the binomial nomenclature
    would be Homo sapiens.
    Taxonomic names in the 18th through 20th centuries were typically derived from Latin, since that was the common

1.2 · A Systematic Approach                                                                                              21

language used by scientists when taxonomic systems were first created. Today, newly discovered organisms can be
given names derived from Latin, Greek, or English. Sometimes these names reflect some distinctive trait of the
organism; in other cases, microorganisms are named after the scientists who discovered them. The archaeon
Haloquadratum walsbyi is an example of both of these naming schemes. The genus, Haloquadratum, describes the
microorganism's saltwater habitat (halo is derived from the Greek word for "salt") as well as the arrangement of its
square cells, which are arranged in square clusters of four cells (quadratum is Latin for "foursquare"). The species,
walsbyi, is named after Anthony Edward Walsby, the microbiologist who discovered Haloquadratum walsbyi in
1980. While it might seem easier to give an organism a common descriptive name--like a red-headed
woodpecker--we can imagine how that could become problematic. What happens when another species of
woodpecker with red head coloring is discovered? The systematic nomenclature scientists use eliminates this
potential problem by assigning each organism a single, unique two-word name that is recognized by scientists all
over the world.

In this text, we will typically abbreviate an organism's genus and species after its first mention. The abbreviated
form is simply the first initial of the genus, followed by a period and the full name of the species. For example, the
bacterium Escherichia coli is shortened to E. coli in its abbreviated form. You will encounter this same convention in
other scientific texts as well.

Bergey's Manuals
Whether in a tree or a web, microbes can be difficult to identify and classify. Without easily observable macroscopic
features like feathers, feet, or fur, scientists must capture, grow, and devise ways to study their biochemical
properties to differentiate and classify microbes. Despite these hurdles, a group of microbiologists created and
updated a set of manuals for identifying and classifying microorganisms. First published in 1923 and since updated
many times, Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology are the
standard references for identifying and classifying different prokaryotes. (Appendix D of this textbook is partly
based on Bergey's manuals; it shows how the organisms that appear in this textbook are classified.) Because so
many bacteria look identical, methods based on nonvisual characteristics must be used to identify them. For
example, biochemical tests can be used to identify chemicals unique to certain species. Likewise, serological tests
can be used to identify specific antibodies that will react against the proteins found in certain species. Ultimately,
DNA and rRNA sequencing can be used both for identifying a particular bacterial species and for classifying newly
discovered species.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Same Name, Different Strain

Within one species of microorganism, there can be several subtypes called strains. While different strains may be
nearly identical genetically, they can have very different attributes. The bacterium Escherichia coli is infamous for
causing food poisoning and traveler's diarrhea. However, there are actually many different strains of E. coli, and they
vary in their ability to cause disease.

One pathogenic (disease-causing) E. coli strain that you may have heard of is E. coli O157:H7. In humans, infection
from E. coli O157:H7 can cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Infection usually originates from contaminated
water or food, particularly raw vegetables and undercooked meat. In the 1990s, there were several large outbreaks
of E. coli O157:H7 thought to have originated in undercooked hamburgers.

While E. coli O157:H7 and some other strains have given E. coli a bad name, most E. coli strains do not cause
disease. In fact, some can be helpful. Different strains of E. coli found naturally in our gut help us digest our food,

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · List the various types of microorganisms and describe their defining characteristics
        · Give examples of different types of cellular and viral microorganisms and infectious agents
        · Describe the similarities and differences between archaea and bacteria
        · Provide an overview of the field of microbiology

    Most microbes are unicellular and small enough that they require artificial magnification to be seen. However, there
    are some unicellular microbes that are visible to the naked eye, and some multicellular organisms that are
    microscopic. An object must measure about 100 micrometers (µm) to be visible without a microscope, but most
    microorganisms are many times smaller than that. For some perspective, consider that a typical animal cell
    measures roughly 10 µm across but is still microscopic. Bacterial cells are typically about 1 µm, and viruses can be
    10 times smaller than bacteria (Figure 1.12). See Table 1.1 for units of length used in microbiology.

    FIGURE 1.12 The relative sizes of various microscopic and nonmicroscopic objects. Note that a typical virus measures about 100 nm, 10
    times smaller than a typical bacterium (~1 µm), which is at least 10 times smaller than a typical plant or animal cell (~10-100 µm). An
    object must measure about 100 µm to be visible without a microscope.

Microorganisms differ from each other not only in size, but also in structure, habitat, metabolism, and many other
characteristics. While we typically think of microorganisms as being unicellular, there are also many multicellular
organisms that are too small to be seen without a microscope. Some microbes, such as viruses, are even acellular
(not composed of cells).

Microorganisms are found in each of the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Microbes within the
domains Bacteria and Archaea are all prokaryotes (their cells lack a nucleus), whereas microbes in the domain
Eukarya are eukaryotes (their cells have a nucleus). Some microorganisms, such as viruses, do not fall within any of
the three domains of life. In this section, we will briefly introduce each of the broad groups of microbes. Later
chapters will go into greater depth about the diverse species within each group.

Prokaryotic Microorganisms

Bacteria are found in nearly every habitat on earth, including within and on humans. Most bacteria are harmless or
helpful, but some are pathogens, causing disease in humans and other animals. Bacteria are prokaryotic because
their genetic material (DNA) is not housed within a true nucleus. Most bacteria have cell walls that contain
peptidoglycan.

Bacteria are often described in terms of their general shape. Common shapes include spherical (coccus), rod-
shaped (bacillus), or curved (spirillum, spirochete, or vibrio). Figure 1.13 shows examples of these shapes.

FIGURE 1.13 Common bacterial shapes. Note how coccobacillus is a combination of spherical (coccus) and rod-shaped (bacillus). (credit

    They have a wide range of metabolic capabilities and can grow in a variety of environments, using different
    combinations of nutrients. Some bacteria are photosynthetic, such as oxygenic cyanobacteria and anoxygenic green
    sulfur and green nonsulfur bacteria; these bacteria use energy derived from sunlight, and fix carbon dioxide for
    growth. Other types of bacteria are nonphotosynthetic, obtaining their energy from organic or inorganic compounds
    in their environment.

    Archaea are also unicellular prokaryotic organisms. Archaea and bacteria have different evolutionary histories, as
    well as significant differences in genetics, metabolic pathways, and the composition of their cell walls and
    membranes. Unlike most bacteria, archaeal cell walls do not contain peptidoglycan, but their cell walls are often
    composed of a similar substance called pseudopeptidoglycan. Like bacteria, archaea are found in nearly every
    habitat on earth, even extreme environments that are very cold, very hot, very basic, or very acidic (Figure 1.14).
    Some archaea live in the human body, but none have been shown to be human pathogens.

    FIGURE 1.14 Some archaea live in extreme environments, such as the Morning Glory pool, a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. The
    color differences in the pool result from the different communities of microbes that are able to thrive at various water temperatures.

        · What are the two main types of prokaryotic organisms?
        · Name some of the defining characteristics of each type.

    Eukaryotic Microorganisms

    The domain Eukarya contains all eukaryotes, including uni- or multicellular eukaryotes such as protists, fungi,
    plants, and animals. The major defining characteristic of eukaryotes is that their cells contain a nucleus.

    Protists
    Protists are an informal grouping of eukaryotes that are not plants, animals, or fungi. Some algae are protists and
    others are bacteria; all protozoa are examples of protists.
    Algae (singular: alga) are mostly made up of protists that can be either unicellular or multicellular and vary widely in
    size, appearance, and habitat (Figure 1.15). Algal protists are surrounded by cell walls made of cellulose, a type of
    carbohydrate. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that extract energy from the sun and release oxygen and
    carbohydrates into their environment. Cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria, is also considered an algae, but these
    organisms are bacterial prokaryotes and therefore have a peptidoglycan-based cell wall, unlike the cellulose-based
    cell wall of the algal protists. Because other organisms can use the waste products of all algae for energy, algae are
    important parts of many ecosystems. Many consumer products contain ingredients derived from algae, such as
    carrageenan or alginic acid, which are found in some brands of ice cream, salad dressing, beverages, lipstick, and
    toothpaste. A derivative of algae also plays a prominent role in the microbiology laboratory. Agar, a gel derived from
    algae, can be mixed with various nutrients and used to grow microorganisms in a Petri dish. Algae are also being
    developed as a possible source for biofuels.

200 m and are visualized here using light microscopy. (credit: modification of work by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)

Protozoa (singular: protozoan) are protists that make up the backbone of many food webs by providing nutrients for
other organisms. Protozoa are very diverse. Some protozoa move with help from hair-like structures called cilia or
whip-like structures called flagella. Others extend part of their cell membrane and cytoplasm to propel themselves
forward. These cytoplasmic extensions are called pseudopods ("false feet"). Some protozoa are photosynthetic;
others feed on organic material. Some are free-living, whereas others are parasitic, only able to survive by extracting
nutrients from a host organism. Most protozoa are harmless, but some are pathogens that can cause disease in
animals or humans (Figure 1.16).

FIGURE 1.16 Giardia lamblia, an intestinal protozoan parasite that infects humans and other mammals, causing severe diarrhea. (credit:
modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Fungi
Fungi (singular: fungus) are also eukaryotes. Some multicellular fungi, such as mushrooms, resemble plants, but
they are actually quite different. Fungi are not photosynthetic, and their cell walls are usually made out of chitin
rather than cellulose.

Unicellular fungi--yeasts--are included within the study of microbiology. There are more than 1000 known species.
Yeasts are found in many different environments, from the deep sea to the human navel. Some yeasts have
beneficial uses, such as causing bread to rise and beverages to ferment; but yeasts can also cause food to spoil.
Some even cause diseases, such as vaginal yeast infections and oral thrush (Figure 1.17).

    is a eukaryotic organism (note the nuclei) and is much larger. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

    Other fungi of interest to microbiologists are multicellular organisms called molds. Molds are made up of long
    filaments that form visible colonies (Figure 1.18). Molds are found in many different environments, from soil to
    rotting food to dank bathroom corners. Molds play a critical role in the decomposition of dead plants and animals.
    Some molds can cause allergies, and others produce disease-causing metabolites called mycotoxins. Molds have
    been used to make pharmaceuticals, including penicillin, which is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics,
    and cyclosporine, used to prevent organ rejection following a transplant.

Helminths

Multicellular parasitic worms called helminths are not technically microorganisms, as most are large enough to see
without a microscope. However, these worms fall within the field of microbiology because diseases caused by
helminths involve microscopic eggs and larvae. One example of a helminth is the guinea worm, or Dracunculus
medinensis, which causes dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, and painful ulcers on the legs and feet when the worm
works its way out of the skin (Figure 1.19). Infection typically occurs after a person drinks water containing water
fleas infected by guinea-worm larvae. In the mid-1980s, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases of guinea-worm
disease, but the disease has been largely eradicated. In 2014, there were only 126 cases reported, thanks to the
coordinated efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other groups committed to improvements in
drinking water sanitation.11 12

Viruses

Viruses are acellular microorganisms, which means they are not composed of cells. Essentially, a virus consists of
proteins and genetic material--either DNA or RNA, but never both--that are inert outside of a host organism.
However, by incorporating themselves into a host cell, viruses are able to co-opt the host's cellular mechanisms to
multiply and infect other hosts.

Viruses can infect all types of cells, from human cells to the cells of other microorganisms. In humans, viruses are
responsible for numerous diseases, from the common cold to deadly Ebola (Figure 1.20). However, many viruses do
not cause disease.

    Microbiology as a Field of Study

    Microbiology is a broad term that encompasses the study of all different types of microorganisms. But in practice,
    microbiologists tend to specialize in one of several subfields. For example, bacteriology is the study of bacteria;
    mycology is the study of fungi; protozoology is the study of protozoa; parasitology is the study of helminths and
    other parasites; and virology is the study of viruses (Figure 1.21). Immunology, the study of the immune system, is
    often included in the study of microbiology because host-pathogen interactions are central to our understanding of
    infectious disease processes. Microbiologists can also specialize in certain areas of microbiology, such as clinical
    microbiology, environmental microbiology, applied microbiology, or food microbiology.

    In this textbook, we are primarily concerned with clinical applications of microbiology, but since the various
    subfields of microbiology are highly interrelated, we will often discuss applications that are not strictly clinical.

  EYE ON ETHICS

  Bioethics in Microbiology

  In the 1940s, the U.S. government was looking for a solution to a medical problem: the prevalence of sexually
  transmitted diseases (STDs) among soldiers. Several now-infamous government-funded studies used human
  subjects to research common STDs and treatments. In one such study, American researchers intentionally
  exposed more than 1300 human subjects in Guatemala to syphilis, gonorrhea, and chancroid to determine the
  ability of penicillin and other antibiotics to combat these diseases. Subjects of the study included Guatemalan
  soldiers, prisoners, prostitutes, and psychiatric patients--none of whom were informed that they were taking
  part in the study. Researchers exposed subjects to STDs by various methods, from facilitating intercourse with
  infected prostitutes to inoculating subjects with the bacteria known to cause the diseases. This latter method
  involved making a small wound on the subject's genitals or elsewhere on the body, and then putting bacteria
  directly into the wound.13 In 2011, a U.S. government commission tasked with investigating the experiment
  revealed that only some of the subjects were treated with penicillin, and 83 subjects died by 1953, likely as a
  result of the study.14

  Unfortunately, this is one of many horrific examples of microbiology experiments that have violated basic ethical
  standards. Even if this study had led to a life-saving medical breakthrough (it did not), few would argue that its
  methods were ethically sound or morally justifiable. But not every case is so clear cut. Professionals working in
  clinical settings are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas, such as working with patients who decline a
  vaccine or life-saving blood transfusion. These are just two examples of life-and-death decisions that may
  intersect with the religious and philosophical beliefs of both the patient and the health-care professional.

  No matter how noble the goal, microbiology studies and clinical practice must be guided by a certain set of
  ethical principles. Studies must be done with integrity. Patients and research subjects provide informed consent
  (not only agreeing to be treated or studied but demonstrating an understanding of the purpose of the study and

    any risks involved). Patients' rights must be respected. Procedures must be approved by an institutional review
    board. When working with patients, accurate record-keeping, honest communication, and confidentiality are
    paramount. Animals used for research must be treated humanely, and all protocols must be approved by an
    institutional animal care and use committee. These are just a few of the ethical principles explored in the Eye on
    Ethics boxes throughout this book.

    CLINICAL FOCUS

    Resolution

    Cora's CSF samples show no signs of inflammation or infection, as would be expected with a viral infection.
    However, there is a high concentration of a particular protein, 14-3-3 protein, in her CSF. An
    electroencephalogram (EEG) of her brain function is also abnormal. The EEG resembles that of a patient with a
    neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's or Huntington's, but Cora's rapid cognitive decline is not consistent
    with either of these. Instead, her doctor concludes that Cora has Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a type of
    transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).

    CJD is an extremely rare disease, with only about 300 cases in the United States each year. It is not caused by a
    bacterium, fungus, or virus, but rather by prions--which do not fit neatly into any particular category of microbe.
    Like viruses, prions are not found on the tree of life because they are acellular. Prions are extremely small, about
    one-tenth the size of a typical virus. They contain no genetic material and are composed solely of a type of
    abnormal protein.

    CJD can have several different causes. It can be acquired through exposure to the brain or nervous-system
    tissue of an infected person or animal. Consuming meat from an infected animal is one way such exposure can
    occur. There have also been rare cases of exposure to CJD through contact with contaminated surgical
    equipment15 and from cornea and growth-hormone donors who unknowingly had CJD.16 17 In rare cases, the
    disease results from a specific genetic mutation that can sometimes be hereditary. However, in approximately
    85% of patients with CJD, the cause of the disease is spontaneous (or sporadic) and has no identifiable
    cause.18 Based on her symptoms and their rapid progression, Cora is diagnosed with sporadic CJD.

    Unfortunately for Cora, CJD is a fatal disease for which there is no approved treatment. Approximately 90% of
    patients die within 1 year of diagnosis.19 Her doctors focus on limiting her pain and cognitive symptoms as her
    disease progresses. Eight months later, Cora dies. Her CJD diagnosis is confirmed with a brain autopsy.

2.3 Instruments of Microscopy
2.4 Staining Microscopic Specimens

INTRODUCTION When we look at a rainbow, its colors span the full spectrum of light that the human eye can
detect and differentiate. Each hue represents a different frequency of visible light, processed by our eyes and brains
and rendered as red, orange, yellow, green, or one of the many other familiar colors that have always been a part of
the human experience. But only recently have humans developed an understanding of the properties of light that
allow us to see images in color.
Over the past several centuries, we have learned to manipulate light to peer into previously invisible worlds-those
too small or too far away to be seen by the naked eye. Through a microscope, we can examine microbial cells, using
various techniques to manipulate color, size, and contrast in ways that help us identify species and diagnose
disease.
Figure 2.1 illustrates how we can apply the properties of light to visualize and magnify images; but these stunning
micrographs are just two examples of the numerous types of images we are now able to produce with different
microscopic technologies. This chapter explores how various types of microscopes manipulate light in order to
provide a window into the world of microorganisms. By understanding how various kinds of microscopes work, we
can produce highly detailed images of microbes that can be useful for both research and clinical applications.

      CLINICAL FOCUS

      Part 1

      Cindy, a 17-year-old counselor at a summer sports camp, scraped her knee playing basketball 2 weeks ago. At
      the time, she thought it was only a minor abrasion that would heal, like many others before it. Instead, the
      wound began to look like an insect bite and has continued to become increasingly painful and swollen.

      The camp nurse examines the lesion and observes a large amount of pus oozing from the surface. Concerned
      that Cindy may have developed a potentially aggressive infection, she swabs the wound to collect a sample from
      the infection site. Then she cleans out the pus and dresses the wound, instructing Cindy to keep the area clean
      and to come back the next day. When Cindy leaves, the nurse sends the sample to the closest medical lab to be
      analyzed under a microscope.

          · What are some things we can learn about these bacteria by looking at them under a microscope?

      Jump to the next Clinical Focus box.

    Visible light consists of electromagnetic waves that behave like other waves. Hence, many of the properties of light
    that are relevant to microscopy can be understood in terms of light's behavior as a wave. An important property of
    light waves is the wavelength, or the distance between one peak of a wave and the next peak. The height of each
    peak (or depth of each trough) is called the amplitude. In contrast, the frequency of the wave is the rate of vibration
    of the wave, or the number of wavelengths within a specified time period (Figure 2.2).

    FIGURE 2.2 (a) The amplitude is the height of a wave, whereas the wavelength is the distance between one peak and the next. (b) These
    waves have different frequencies, or rates of vibration. The wave at the top has the lowest frequency, since it has the fewest peaks per unit
    time. The wave at the bottom has the highest frequency.

    Interactions of Light

    Light waves interact with materials by being reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. Reflection occurs when a wave
    bounces off of a material. For example, a red piece of cloth may reflect red light to our eyes while absorbing other
    colors of light. Absorbance occurs when a material captures the energy of a light wave. In the case of glow-in-the-
    dark plastics, the energy from light can be absorbed and then later re-emitted as another form of phosphorescence.
    Transmission occurs when a wave travels through a material, like light through glass (the process of transmission is
    called transmittance). When a material allows a large proportion of light to be transmitted, it may do so because it
    is thinner, or more transparent (having more transparency and less opacity). Figure 2.3 illustrates the difference
    between transparency and opacity.

    FIGURE 2.3 (a) A Petri dish is made of transparent plastic or glass, which allows transmission of a high proportion of light. This
    transparency allows us to see through the sides of the dish to view the contents. (b) This slice of an iron meteorite is opaque (i.e., it has

opacity). Light is not transmitted through the material, making it impossible to see the part of the hand covered by the object. (credit a:

Light waves can also interact with each other by interference, creating complex patterns of motion. Dropping two
pebbles into a puddle causes the waves on the puddle's surface to interact, creating complex interference patterns.
Light waves can interact in the same way.

In addition to interfering with each other, light waves can also interact with small objects or openings by bending or
scattering. This is called diffraction. Diffraction is larger when the object is smaller relative to the wavelength of the
light (the distance between two consecutive peaks of a light wave). Often, when waves diffract in different directions
around an obstacle or opening, they will interfere with each other.

     CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

    · If a light wave has a long wavelength, is it likely to have a low or high frequency?
    · If an object is transparent, does it reflect, absorb, or transmit light?

Lenses and Refraction

In the context of microscopy, refraction is perhaps the most important behavior exhibited by light waves. Refraction
occurs when light waves change direction as they enter a new medium (Figure 2.4). Different transparent materials
transmit light at different speeds; thus, light can change speed when passing from one material to another. This
change in speed usually also causes a change in direction (refraction), with the degree of change dependent on the
angle of the incoming light.

FIGURE 2.4 (a) Refraction occurs when light passes from one medium, such as air, to another, such as glass, changing the direction of the
light rays. (b) As shown in this diagram, light rays passing from one medium to another may be either refracted or reflected.

The extent to which a material slows transmission speed relative to empty space is called the refractive index of
that material. Large differences between the refractive indices of two materials will result in a large amount of
refraction when light passes from one material to the other. For example, light moves much more slowly through
water than through air, so light entering water from air can change direction greatly. We say that the water has a
higher refractive index than air (Figure 2.5).

FIGURE 2.5 This straight pole appears to bend at an angle as it enters the water. This optical illusion is due to the large difference between
the refractive indices of air and water.
38  2 · How We See the Invisible World

    When light crosses a boundary into a material with a higher refractive index, its direction turns to be closer to
    perpendicular to the boundary (i.e., more toward a normal to that boundary; see Figure 2.5). This is the principle
    behind lenses. We can think of a lens as an object with a curved boundary (or a collection of prisms) that collects all
    of the light that strikes it and refracts it so that it all meets at a single point called the image point (focus). A convex
    lens can be used to magnify because it can focus at closer range than the human eye, producing a larger image.
    Concave lenses and mirrors can also be used in microscopes to redirect the light path. Figure 2.6 shows the focal
    point (the image point when light entering the lens is parallel) and the focal length (the distance to the focal point)
    for convex and concave lenses.

    FIGURE 2.6 (a) A lens is like a collection of prisms, such as the one shown here. (b) When light passes through a convex lens, it is refracted
    toward a focal point on the other side of the lens. The focal length is the distance to the focal point. (c) Light passing through a concave lens
    is refracted away from a focal point in front of the lens.

    The human eye contains a lens that enables us to see images. This lens focuses the light reflecting off of objects in
    front of the eye onto the surface of the retina, which is like a screen in the back of the eye. Artificial lenses placed in
    front of the eye (contact lenses, glasses, or microscopic lenses) focus light before it is focused (again) by the lens of
    the eye, manipulating the image that ends up on the retina (e.g., by making it appear larger).

    Images are commonly manipulated by controlling the distances between the object, the lens, and the screen, as
    well as the curvature of the lens. For example, for a given amount of curvature, when an object is closer to the lens,
    the focal points are farther from the lens. As a result, it is often necessary to manipulate these distances to create a
    focused image on a screen. Similarly, more curvature creates image points closer to the lens and a larger image
    when the image is in focus. This property is often described in terms of the focal distance, or distance to the focal
    point.

    EMR include microwaves, X-rays, and radio waves, among others. The different types of EMR fall on the
    electromagnetic spectrum, which is defined in terms of wavelength and frequency. The spectrum of visible light
    occupies a relatively small range of frequencies between infrared and ultraviolet light (Figure 2.7).

relatively small range of electromagnetic frequencies that can be sensed by the human eye. On the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light
falls between ultraviolet and infrared light. (credit: modification of work by Johannes Ahlmann)

Whereas wavelength represents the distance between adjacent peaks of a light wave, frequency, in a simplified
definition, represents the rate of oscillation. Waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and,
therefore, have more oscillations per unit time than lower-frequency waves. Higher-frequency waves also contain
more energy than lower-frequency waves. This energy is delivered as elementary particles called photons. Higher-
frequency waves deliver more energetic photons than lower-frequency waves.

Photons with different energies interact differently with the retina. In the spectrum of visible light, each color
corresponds to a particular frequency and wavelength (Figure 2.7).The lowest frequency of visible light appears as
the color red, whereas the highest appears as the color violet. When the retina receives visible light of many
different frequencies, we perceive this as white light. However, white light can be separated into its component
colors using refraction. If we pass white light through a prism, different colors will be refracted in different
directions, creating a rainbow-like spectrum on a screen behind the prism. This separation of colors is called
dispersion, and it occurs because, for a given material, the refractive index is different for different frequencies of
light.

Certain materials can refract nonvisible forms of EMR and, in effect, transform them into visible light. Certain
fluorescent dyes, for instance, absorb ultraviolet or blue light and then use the energy to emit photons of a different
color, giving off light rather than simply vibrating. This occurs because the energy absorption causes electrons to
jump to higher energy states, after which they then almost immediately fall back down to their ground states,
emitting specific amounts of energy as photons. Not all of the energy is emitted in a given photon, so the emitted
photons will be of lower energy and, thus, of lower frequency than the absorbed ones. Thus, a dye such as Texas red
may be excited by blue light, but emit red light; or a dye such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) may absorb
(invisible) high-energy ultraviolet light and emit green light (Figure 2.8). In some materials, the photons may be
emitted following a delay after absorption; in this case, the process is called phosphorescence. Glow-in-the-dark
plastic works by using phosphorescent material.

    Magnification, Resolution, and Contrast

    Microscopes magnify images and use the properties of light to create useful images of small objects. Magnification
    is defined as the ability of a lens to enlarge the image of an object when compared to the real object. For example, a
    magnification of 10 means that the image appears 10 times the size of the object as viewed with the naked eye.
    Greater magnification typically improves our ability to see details of small objects, but magnification alone is not
    sufficient to make the most useful images. It is often useful to enhance the resolution of objects: the ability to tell
    that two separate points or objects are separate. A low-resolution image appears fuzzy, whereas a high-resolution
    image appears sharp. Two factors affect resolution. The first is wavelength. Shorter wavelengths are able to resolve
    smaller objects; thus, an electron microscope has a much higher resolution than a light microscope, since it uses an
    electron beam with a very short wavelength, as opposed to the long-wavelength visible light used by a light
    microscope. The second factor that affects resolution is numerical aperture, which is a measure of a lens's ability to
    gather light. The higher the numerical aperture, the better the resolution.

    Read this article (https://www.openstax.org/l/22aperture) to learn more about factors that can increase or decrease
    the numerical aperture of a lens.

    Even when a microscope has high resolution, it can be difficult to distinguish small structures in many specimens
    because microorganisms are relatively transparent. It is often necessary to increase contrast to detect different
    structures in a specimen. Various types of microscopes use different features of light or electrons to increase
    contrast--visible differences between the parts of a specimen (see Instruments of Microscopy). Additionally, dyes
    that bind to some structures but not others can be used to improve the contrast between images of relatively
    transparent objects (see Staining Microscopic Specimens).

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe historical developments and individual contributions that led to the invention and development
        of the microscope

    · Compare and contrast the features of simple and compound microscopes

Some of the fundamental characteristics and functions of microscopes can be understood in the context of the
history of their use. Italian scholar Girolamo Fracastoro is regarded as the first person to formally postulate that
disease was spread by tiny invisible seminaria, or "seeds of the contagion." In his book De Contagione (1546), he
proposed that these seeds could attach themselves to certain objects (which he called fomes [cloth]) that
supported their transfer from person to person. However, since the technology for seeing such tiny objects did not
yet exist, the existence of the seminaria remained hypothetical for a little over a century--an invisible world waiting
to be revealed.

Early Microscopes

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, sometimes hailed as "the Father of Microbiology," is typically credited as the first person
to have created microscopes powerful enough to view microbes (Figure 2.9). Born in the city of Delft in the Dutch
Republic, van Leeuwenhoek began his career selling fabrics. However, he later became interested in lens making
(perhaps to look at threads) and his innovative techniques produced microscopes that allowed him to observe
microorganisms as no one had before. In 1674, he described his observations of single-celled organisms, whose
existence was previously unknown, in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London. His report was initially met
with skepticism, but his claims were soon verified and he became something of a celebrity in the scientific
community.

FIGURE 2.9 (a) Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) is credited as being the first person to observe microbes, including bacteria, which
he called "animalcules" and "wee little beasties." (b) Even though van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes were simple microscopes (as seen in
this replica), they were more powerful and provided better resolution than the compound microscopes of his day. (c) Though more famous
for developing the telescope, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was also one of the pioneers of microscopy. (credit b: modification of work by
"Wellcome Images"/Wikimedia Commons)

While van Leeuwenhoek is credited with the discovery of microorganisms, others before him had contributed to the
development of the microscope. These included eyeglass makers in the Netherlands in the late 1500s, as well as
the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who used a compound microscope to examine insect parts (Figure 2.9).
Whereas van Leeuwenhoek used a simple microscope, in which light is passed through just one lens, Galileo's
compound microscope was more sophisticated, passing light through two sets of lenses.

Van Leeuwenhoek's contemporary, the Englishman Robert Hooke (1635-1703), also made important contributions
to microscopy, publishing in his book Micrographia (1665) many observations using compound microscopes.
Viewing a thin sample of cork through his microscope, he was the first to observe the structures that we now know
as cells (Figure 2.10). Hooke described these structures as resembling "Honey-comb," and as "small Boxes or
Bladders of Air," noting that each "Cavern, Bubble, or Cell" is distinct from the others (in Latin, "cell" literally means
"small room"). They likely appeared to Hooke to be filled with air because the cork cells were dead, with only the
rigid cell walls providing the structure.

    Who Invented the Microscope?

    While Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke generally receive much of the credit for early advances in
    microscopy, neither can claim to be the inventor of the microscope. Some argue that this designation should belong
    to Hans and Zaccharias Janssen, Dutch spectacle-makers who may have invented the telescope, the simple
    microscope, and the compound microscope during the late 1500s or early 1600s (Figure 2.11). Unfortunately, little
    is known for sure about the Janssens, not even the exact dates of their births and deaths. The Janssens were
    secretive about their work and never published. It is also possible that the Janssens did not invent anything at all;
    their neighbor, Hans Lippershey, also developed microscopes and telescopes during the same time frame, and he is
    often credited with inventing the telescope. The historical records from the time are as fuzzy and imprecise as the
    images viewed through those early lenses, and any archived records have been lost over the centuries.
    By contrast, van Leeuwenhoek and Hooke can thank ample documentation of their work for their respective
    legacies. Like Janssen, van Leeuwenhoek began his work in obscurity, leaving behind few records. However, his
    friend, the prominent physician Reinier de Graaf, wrote a letter to the editor of the Philosophical Transactions of the
    Royal Society of London calling attention to van Leeuwenhoek's powerful microscopes. From 1673 onward, van
    Leeuwenhoek began regularly submitting letters to the Royal Society detailing his observations. In 1674, his report
    describing single-celled organisms produced controversy in the scientific community, but his observations were
    soon confirmed when the society sent a delegation to investigate his findings. He subsequently enjoyed
    considerable celebrity, at one point even entertaining a visit by the czar of Russia.
    Similarly, Robert Hooke had his observations using microscopes published by the Royal Society in a book called
    Micrographia in 1665. The book became a bestseller and greatly increased interest in microscopy throughout much
    of Europe.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify and describe the parts of a brightfield microscope
    · Calculate total magnification for a compound microscope
    · Describe the distinguishing features and typical uses for various types of light microscopes, electron

        microscopes, and scanning probe microscopes

The early pioneers of microscopy opened a window into the invisible world of microorganisms. But microscopy
continued to advance in the centuries that followed. In 1830, Joseph Jackson Lister created an essentially modern
light microscope. The 20th century saw the development of microscopes that leveraged nonvisible light, such as
fluorescence microscopy, which uses an ultraviolet light source, and electron microscopy, which uses short-
wavelength electron beams. These advances led to major improvements in magnification, resolution, and contrast.
By comparison, the relatively rudimentary microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek and his contemporaries were far less
powerful than even the most basic microscopes in use today. In this section, we will survey the broad range of
modern microscopic technology and common applications for each type of microscope.

Light Microscopy

Many types of microscopes fall under the category of light microscopes, which use light to visualize images.
Examples of light microscopes include brightfield microscopes, darkfield microscopes, phase-contrast microscopes,
differential interference contrast microscopes, fluorescence microscopes, confocal scanning laser microscopes, and
two-photon microscopes. These various types of light microscopes can be used to complement each other in
diagnostics and research.

Brightfield Microscopes
The brightfield microscope, perhaps the most commonly used type of microscope, is a compound microscope with
two or more lenses that produce a dark image on a bright background. Some brightfield microscopes are monocular
(having a single eyepiece), though most newer brightfield microscopes are binocular (having two eyepieces), like
the one shown in Figure 2.12; in either case, each eyepiece contains a lens called an ocular lens. The ocular lenses
typically magnify images 10 times (10). At the other end of the body tube are a set of objective lenses on a
rotating nosepiece. The magnification of these objective lenses typically ranges from 4 to 100, with the
magnification for each lens designated on the metal casing of the lens. The ocular and objective lenses work
together to create a magnified image. The total magnification is the product of the ocular magnification times the
44  2 · How We See the Invisible World

    objective magnification:
    For example, if a 40 objective lens is selected and the ocular lens is 10, the total magnification would be

                                                        FIGURE 2.12 Components of a typical brightfield microscope.

    The item being viewed is called a specimen. The specimen is placed on a glass slide, which is then clipped into place
    on the stage (a platform) of the microscope. Once the slide is secured, the specimen on the slide is positioned over
    the light using the x-y mechanical stage knobs. These knobs move the slide on the surface of the stage, but do not
    raise or lower the stage. Once the specimen is centered over the light, the stage position can be raised or lowered to
    focus the image. The coarse focusing knob is used for large-scale movements with 4 and 10 objective lenses;
    the fine focusing knob is used for small-scale movements, especially with 40 or 100 objective lenses.

    When images are magnified, they become dimmer because there is less light per unit area of image. Highly
    magnified images produced by microscopes, therefore, require intense lighting. In a brightfield microscope, this
    light is provided by an illuminator, which is typically a high-intensity bulb below the stage. Light from the illuminator
    passes up through condenser lens (located below the stage), which focuses all of the light rays on the specimen to
    maximize illumination. The position of the condenser can be optimized using the attached condenser focus knob;
    once the optimal distance is established, the condenser should not be moved to adjust the brightness. If less-than-
    maximal light levels are needed, the amount of light striking the specimen can be easily adjusted by opening or
    closing a diaphragm between the condenser and the specimen. In some cases, brightness can also be adjusted
    using the rheostat, a dimmer switch that controls the intensity of the illuminator.

    A brightfield microscope creates an image by directing light from the illuminator at the specimen; this light is
    differentially transmitted, absorbed, reflected, or refracted by different structures. Different colors can behave
    differently as they interact with chromophores (pigments that absorb and reflect particular wavelengths of light) in
    parts of the specimen. Often, chromophores are artificially added to the specimen using stains, which serve to
    increase contrast and resolution. In general, structures in the specimen will appear darker, to various extents, than
    the bright background, creating maximally sharp images at magnifications up to about 1000. Further magnification
    would create a larger image, but without increased resolution. This allows us to see objects as small as bacteria,
    which are visible at about 400 or so, but not smaller objects such as viruses.

At very high magnifications, resolution may be compromised when light passes through the small amount of air
between the specimen and the lens. This is due to the large difference between the refractive indices of air and
glass; the air scatters the light rays before they can be focused by the lens. To solve this problem, a drop of oil can
be used to fill the space between the specimen and an oil immersion lens, a special lens designed to be used with
immersion oils. Since the oil has a refractive index very similar to that of glass, it increases the maximum angle at
which light leaving the specimen can strike the lens. This increases the light collected and, thus, the resolution of
the image (Figure 2.13). A variety of oils can be used for different types of light.

FIGURE 2.13 (a) Oil immersion lenses like this one are used to improve resolution. (b) Because immersion oil and glass have very similar
refractive indices, there is a minimal amount of refraction before the light reaches the lens. Without immersion oil, light scatters as it passes
through the air above the slide, degrading the resolution of the image.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Microscope Maintenance: Best Practices

Even a very powerful microscope cannot deliver high-resolution images if it is not properly cleaned and maintained.
Since lenses are carefully designed and manufactured to refract light with a high degree of precision, even a slightly
dirty or scratched lens will refract light in unintended ways, degrading the image of the specimen. In addition,
microscopes are rather delicate instruments, and great care must be taken to avoid damaging parts and surfaces.
Among other things, proper care of a microscope includes the following:

    · cleaning the lenses with lens paper
    · not allowing lenses to contact the slide (e.g., by rapidly changing the focus)
    · protecting the bulb (if there is one) from breakage
    · not pushing an objective into a slide
    · not using the coarse focusing knob when using the 40 or greater objective lenses
    · only using immersion oil with a specialized oil objective, usually the 100 objective
    · cleaning oil from immersion lenses after using the microscope
    · cleaning any oil accidentally transferred from other lenses
    · covering the microscope or placing it in a cabinet when not in use

    Darkfield Microscopy
    A darkfield microscope is a brightfield microscope that has a small but significant modification to the condenser. A
    small, opaque disk (about 1 cm in diameter) is placed between the illuminator and the condenser lens. This opaque
    light stop, as the disk is called, blocks most of the light from the illuminator as it passes through the condenser on
    its way to the objective lens, producing a hollow cone of light that is focused on the specimen. The only light that
    reaches the objective is light that has been refracted or reflected by structures in the specimen. The resulting image
    typically shows bright objects on a dark background (Figure 2.14).

    FIGURE 2.14 An opaque light stop inserted into a brightfield microscope is used to produce a darkfield image. The light stop blocks light
    traveling directly from the illuminator to the objective lens, allowing only light reflected or refracted off the specimen to reach the eye.

    Darkfield microscopy can often create high-contrast, high-resolution images of specimens without the use of stains,
    which is particularly useful for viewing live specimens that might be killed or otherwise compromised by the stains.
    For example, thin spirochetes like Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, can be best viewed using a
    darkfield microscope (Figure 2.15).

    FIGURE 2.15 Use of a darkfield microscope allows us to view living, unstained samples of the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Similar to a

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Part 2

  Wound infections like Cindy's can be caused by many different types of bacteria, some of which can spread
  rapidly with serious complications. Identifying the specific cause is very important to select a medication that
  can kill or stop the growth of the bacteria.

  After calling a local doctor about Cindy's case, the camp nurse sends the sample from the wound to the closest
  medical laboratory. Unfortunately, since the camp is in a remote area, the nearest lab is small and poorly
  equipped. A more modern lab would likely use other methods to culture, grow, and identify the bacteria, but in
  this case, the technician decides to make a wet mount from the specimen and view it under a brightfield
  microscope. In a wet mount, a small drop of water is added to the slide, and a cover slip is placed over the
  specimen to keep it in place before it is positioned under the objective lens.

  Under the brightfield microscope, the technician can barely see the bacteria cells because they are nearly
  transparent against the bright background. To increase contrast, the technician inserts an opaque light stop
  above the illuminator. The resulting darkfield image clearly shows that the bacteria cells are spherical and
  grouped in clusters, like grapes.

Phase-Contrast Microscopes
Phase-contrast microscopes use refraction and interference caused by structures in a specimen to create high-
contrast, high-resolution images without staining. It is the oldest and simplest type of microscope that creates an
image by altering the wavelengths of light rays passing through the specimen. To create altered wavelength paths,
an annular stop is used in the condenser. The annular stop produces a hollow cone of light that is focused on the
specimen before reaching the objective lens. The objective contains a phase plate containing a phase ring. As a
result, light traveling directly from the illuminator passes through the phase ring while light refracted or reflected by
the specimen passes through the plate. This causes waves traveling through the ring to be about one-half of a
wavelength out of phase with those passing through the plate. Because waves have peaks and troughs, they can add
together (if in phase together) or cancel each other out (if out of phase). When the wavelengths are out of phase,
wave troughs will cancel out wave peaks, which is called destructive interference. Structures that refract light then
appear dark against a bright background of only unrefracted light. More generally, structures that differ in features
such as refractive index will differ in levels of darkness (Figure 2.16).
48  2 · How We See the Invisible World

    FIGURE 2.16 This diagram of a phase-contrast microscope illustrates phase differences between light passing through the object and
    background. These differences are produced by passing the rays through different parts of a phase plate. The light rays are superimposed
    in the image plane, producing contrast due to their interference.

    Because it increases contrast without requiring stains, phase-contrast microscopy is often used to observe live
    specimens. Certain structures, such as organelles in eukaryotic cells and endospores in prokaryotic cells, are
    especially well visualized with phase-contrast microscopy (Figure 2.17).

    FIGURE 2.17 This figure compares a brightfield image (left) with a phase-contrast image (right) of the same unstained simple squamous
    epithelial cells. The cells are in the center and bottom right of each photograph (the irregular item above the cells is acellular debris). Notice
    that the unstained cells in the brightfield image are almost invisible against the background, whereas the cells in the phase-contrast image
    appear to glow against the background, revealing far more detail.

    Differential Interference Contrast Microscopes
    Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopes (also known as Nomarski optics) are similar to phase-
    contrast microscopes in that they use interference patterns to enhance contrast between different features of a
    specimen. In a DIC microscope, two beams of light are created in which the direction of wave movement
    (polarization) differs. Once the beams pass through either the specimen or specimen-free space, they are
    recombined and effects of the specimens cause differences in the interference patterns generated by the combining
    of the beams. This results in high-contrast images of living organisms with a three-dimensional appearance. These
    microscopes are especially useful in distinguishing structures within live, unstained specimens. (Figure 2.18)

    · What are some advantages of phase-contrast and DIC microscopy?

Fluorescence Microscopes
A fluorescence microscope uses fluorescent chromophores called fluorochromes, which are capable of absorbing
energy from a light source and then emitting this energy as visible light. Fluorochromes include naturally fluorescent
substances (such as chlorophylls) as well as fluorescent stains that are added to the specimen to create contrast.
Dyes such as Texas red and FITC are examples of fluorochromes. Other examples include the nucleic acid dyes
4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and acridine orange.

The microscope transmits an excitation light, generally a form of EMR with a short wavelength, such as ultraviolet or
blue light, toward the specimen; the chromophores absorb the excitation light and emit visible light with longer
wavelengths. The excitation light is then filtered out (in part because ultraviolet light is harmful to the eyes) so that
only visible light passes through the ocular lens. This produces an image of the specimen in bright colors against a
dark background.

Fluorescence microscopes are especially useful in clinical microbiology. They can be used to identify pathogens, to
find particular species within an environment, or to find the locations of particular molecules and structures within a
cell. Approaches have also been developed to distinguish living from dead cells using fluorescence microscopy
based upon whether they take up particular fluorochromes. Sometimes, multiple fluorochromes are used on the
same specimen to show different structures or features.

One of the most important applications of fluorescence microscopy is a technique called immunofluorescence,
which is used to identify certain disease-causing microbes by observing whether antibodies bind to them.
(Antibodies are protein molecules produced by the immune system that attach to specific pathogens to kill or inhibit
them.) There are two approaches to this technique: direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) and indirect
immunofluorescence assay (IFA). In DFA, specific antibodies (e.g., those that the target the rabies virus) are stained
with a fluorochrome. If the specimen contains the targeted pathogen, one can observe the antibodies binding to the
pathogen under the fluorescent microscope. This is called a primary antibody stain because the stained antibodies
attach directly to the pathogen.

In IFA, secondary antibodies are stained with a fluorochrome rather than primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies
do not attach directly to the pathogen, but they do bind to primary antibodies. When the unstained primary
antibodies bind to the pathogen, the fluorescent secondary antibodies can be observed binding to the primary
antibodies. Thus, the secondary antibodies are attached indirectly to the pathogen. Since multiple secondary
antibodies can often attach to a primary antibody, IFA increases the number of fluorescent antibodies attached to
the specimen, making it easier visualize features in the specimen (Figure 2.19).

        · Why must fluorochromes be used to examine a specimen under a fluorescence microscope?

    Confocal Microscopes
    Whereas other forms of light microscopy create an image that is maximally focused at a single distance from the
    observer (the depth, or z-plane), a confocal microscope uses a laser to scan multiple z-planes successively. This
    produces numerous two-dimensional, high-resolution images at various depths, which can be constructed into a
    three-dimensional image by a computer. As with fluorescence microscopes, fluorescent stains are generally used to
    increase contrast and resolution. Image clarity is further enhanced by a narrow aperture that eliminates any light
    that is not from the z-plane. Confocal microscopes are thus very useful for examining thick specimens such as
    biofilms, which can be examined alive and unfixed (Figure 2.20).

Two-Photon Microscopes
While the original fluorescent and confocal microscopes allowed better visualization of unique features in
specimens, there were still problems that prevented optimum visualization. The effective sensitivity of fluorescence
microscopy when viewing thick specimens was generally limited by out-of-focus flare, which resulted in poor
resolution. This limitation was greatly reduced in the confocal microscope through the use of a confocal pinhole to
reject out-of-focus background fluorescence with thin (<1 m), unblurred optical sections. However, even the
confocal microscopes lacked the resolution needed for viewing thick tissue samples. These problems were resolved
with the development of the two-photon microscope, which uses a scanning technique, fluorochromes, and long-
wavelength light (such as infrared) to visualize specimens. The low energy associated with the long-wavelength light
means that two photons must strike a location at the same time to excite the fluorochrome. The low energy of the
excitation light is less damaging to cells, and the long wavelength of the excitation light more easily penetrates deep
into thick specimens. This makes the two-photon microscope useful for examining living cells within intact
tissues--brain slices, embryos, whole organs, and even entire animals.

Currently, use of two-photon microscopes is limited to advanced clinical and research laboratories because of the
high costs of the instruments. A single two-photon microscope typically costs between $300,000 and $500,000,
and the lasers used to excite the dyes used on specimens are also very expensive. However, as technology
improves, two-photon microscopes may become more readily available in clinical settings.

Electron Microscopy

The maximum theoretical resolution of images created by light microscopes is ultimately limited by the wavelengths
of visible light. Most light microscopes can only magnify 1000, and a few can magnify up to 1500, but this does
not begin to approach the magnifying power of an electron microscope (EM), which uses short-wavelength electron
beams rather than light to increase magnification and resolution.

Electrons, like electromagnetic radiation, can behave as waves, but with wavelengths of 0.005 nm, they can produce
much better resolution than visible light. An EM can produce a sharp image that is magnified up to 100,000. Thus,
EMs can resolve subcellular structures as well as some molecular structures (e.g., single strands of DNA); however,
electron microscopy cannot be used on living material because of the methods needed to prepare the specimens.

There are two basic types of EM: the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) (Figure 2.21). The TEM is somewhat analogous to the brightfield light microscope in terms of the
way it functions. However, it uses an electron beam from above the specimen that is focused using a magnetic lens
(rather than a glass lens) and projected through the specimen onto a detector. Electrons pass through the specimen,
and then the detector captures the image (Figure 2.22).

    FIGURE 2.22 Electron microscopes use magnets to focus electron beams similarly to the way that light microscopes use lenses to focus
    light.

    For electrons to pass through the specimen in a TEM, the specimen must be extremely thin (20-100 nm thick). The
    image is produced because of varying opacity in various parts of the specimen. This opacity can be enhanced by
    staining the specimen with materials such as heavy metals, which are electron dense. TEM requires that the beam
    and specimen be in a vacuum and that the specimen be very thin and dehydrated. The specific steps needed to
    prepare a specimen for observation under an EM are discussed in detail in the next section.

    SEMs form images of surfaces of specimens, usually from electrons that are knocked off of specimens by a beam of
    electrons. This can create highly detailed images with a three-dimensional appearance that are displayed on a
    monitor (Figure 2.23). Typically, specimens are dried and prepared with fixatives that reduce artifacts, such as
    shriveling, that can be produced by drying, before being sputter-coated with a thin layer of metal such as gold.
    Whereas transmission electron microscopy requires very thin sections and allows one to see internal structures
    such as organelles and the interior of membranes, scanning electron microscopy can be used to view the surfaces of
    larger objects (such as a pollen grain) as well as the surfaces of very small samples (Figure 2.24). Some EMs can
    magnify an image up to 2,000,000.1

    To expand both the resolution and the types of materials that could be examined, Pratibha L. Gai and Edward D.

Thus researchers could observe actual reactions taking place at incredible magnifications. Gai later improved on her

resolving power. Gai herself was the first person to ever see individual atoms interacting.

    Using Microscopy to Study Biofilms

    A biofilm is a complex community of one or more microorganism species, typically forming as a slimy coating
    attached to a surface because of the production of an extrapolymeric substance (EPS) that attaches to a surface or
    at the interface between surfaces (e.g., between air and water). In nature, biofilms are abundant and frequently
    occupy complex niches within ecosystems (Figure 2.25). In medicine, biofilms can coat medical devices and exist
    within the body. Because they possess unique characteristics, such as increased resistance against the immune
    system and to antimicrobial drugs, biofilms are of particular interest to microbiologists and clinicians alike.

    Because biofilms are thick, they cannot be observed very well using light microscopy; slicing a biofilm to create a
    thinner specimen might kill or disturb the microbial community. Confocal microscopy provides clearer images of
    biofilms because it can focus on one z-plane at a time and produce a three-dimensional image of a thick specimen.
    Fluorescent dyes can be helpful in identifying cells within the matrix. Additionally, techniques such as
    immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), in which fluorescent probes are used to bind to
    DNA, can be used.

    Electron microscopy can be used to observe biofilms, but only after dehydrating the specimen, which produces
    undesirable artifacts and distorts the specimen. In addition to these approaches, it is possible to follow water
    currents through the shapes (such as cones and mushrooms) of biofilms, using video of the movement of
    fluorescently coated beads (Figure 2.26).

Scanning Probe Microscopy

A scanning probe microscope does not use light or electrons, but rather very sharp probes that are passed over the
surface of the specimen and interact with it directly. This produces information that can be assembled into images
with magnifications up to 100,000,000. Such large magnifications can be used to observe individual atoms on
surfaces. To date, these techniques have been used primarily for research rather than for diagnostics.
There are two types of scanning probe microscope: the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force
microscope (AFM). An STM uses a probe that is passed just above the specimen as a constant voltage bias creates
the potential for an electric current between the probe and the specimen. This current occurs via quantum tunneling
of electrons between the probe and the specimen, and the intensity of the current is dependent upon the distance
between the probe and the specimen. The probe is moved horizontally above the surface and the intensity of the
current is measured. Scanning tunneling microscopy can effectively map the structure of surfaces at a resolution at
which individual atoms can be detected.
Similar to an STM, AFMs have a thin probe that is passed just above the specimen. However, rather than measuring
variations in the current at a constant height above the specimen, an AFM establishes a constant current and
measures variations in the height of the probe tip as it passes over the specimen. As the probe tip is passed over the
specimen, forces between the atoms (van der Waals forces, capillary forces, chemical bonding, electrostatic forces,
and others) cause it to move up and down. Deflection of the probe tip is determined and measured using Hooke's
law of elasticity, and this information is used to construct images of the surface of the specimen with resolution at
the atomic level (Figure 2.27).
Figure 2.28, Figure 2.29, and Figure 2.30 summarize the microscopy techniques for light microscopes, electron
microscopes, and scanning probe microscopes, respectively.

In their natural state, most of the cells and microorganisms that we observe under the microscope lack color and
contrast. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to detect important cellular structures and their distinguishing
characteristics without artificially treating specimens. We have already alluded to certain techniques involving stains
58  2 · How We See the Invisible World

    and fluorescent dyes, and in this section we will discuss specific techniques for sample preparation in greater detail.
    Indeed, numerous methods have been developed to identify specific microbes, cellular structures, DNA sequences,
    or indicators of infection in tissue samples, under the microscope. Here, we will focus on the most clinically relevant
    techniques.

    Preparing Specimens for Light Microscopy

    In clinical settings, light microscopes are the most commonly used microscopes. There are two basic types of
    preparation used to view specimens with a light microscope: wet mounts and fixed specimens.

    The simplest type of preparation is the wet mount, in which the specimen is placed on the slide in a drop of liquid.
    Some specimens, such as a drop of urine, are already in a liquid form and can be deposited on the slide using a
    dropper. Solid specimens, such as a skin scraping, can be placed on the slide before adding a drop of liquid to
    prepare the wet mount. Sometimes the liquid used is simply water, but often stains are added to enhance contrast.
    Once the liquid has been added to the slide, a coverslip is placed on top and the specimen is ready for examination
    under the microscope.

    The second method of preparing specimens for light microscopy is fixation. The "fixing" of a sample refers to the
    process of attaching cells to a slide. Fixation is often achieved either by heating (heat fixing) or chemically treating
    the specimen. In addition to attaching the specimen to the slide, fixation also kills microorganisms in the specimen,
    stopping their movement and metabolism while preserving the integrity of their cellular components for
    observation.

    To heat-fix a sample, a thin layer of the specimen is spread on the slide (called a smear), and the slide is then briefly
    heated over a heat source (Figure 2.31). Chemical fixatives are often preferable to heat for tissue specimens.
    Chemical agents such as acetic acid, ethanol, methanol, formaldehyde (formalin), and glutaraldehyde can denature
    proteins, stop biochemical reactions, and stabilize cell structures in tissue samples (Figure 2.31).

    FIGURE 2.31 (a) A specimen can be heat-fixed by using a slide warmer like this one. (b) Another method for heat-fixing a specimen is to
    hold a slide with a smear over a microincinerator. (c) This tissue sample is being fixed in a solution of formalin (also known as
    formaldehyde). Chemical fixation kills microorganisms in the specimen, stopping degradation of the tissues and preserving their structure
    so that they can be examined later under the microscope. (credit a: modification of work by Nina Parker; credit b: modification of work by
    Nina Parker; credit c: modification of work by "University of Bristol"/YouTube)

    In addition to fixation, staining is almost always applied to color certain features of a specimen before examining it
    under a light microscope. Stains, or dyes, contain salts made up of a positive ion and a negative ion. Depending on
    the type of dye, the positive or the negative ion may be the chromophore (the colored ion); the other, uncolored ion
    is called the counterion. If the chromophore is the positively charged ion, the stain is classified as a basic dye; if the
    negative ion is the chromophore, the stain is considered an acidic dye.

    Dyes are selected for staining based on the chemical properties of the dye and the specimen being observed, which
    determine how the dye will interact with the specimen. In most cases, it is preferable to use a positive stain, a dye
    that will be absorbed by the cells or organisms being observed, adding color to objects of interest to make them
    stand out against the background. However, there are scenarios in which it is advantageous to use a negative stain,
    which is absorbed by the background but not by the cells or organisms in the specimen. Negative staining produces
    an outline or silhouette of the organisms against a colorful background (Figure 2.32).

Because cells typically have negatively charged cell walls, the positive chromophores in basic dyes tend to stick to
the cell walls, making them positive stains. Thus, commonly used basic dyes such as basic fuchsin, crystal violet,
malachite green, methylene blue, and safranin typically serve as positive stains. On the other hand, the negatively
charged chromophores in acidic dyes are repelled by negatively charged cell walls, making them negative stains.
Commonly used acidic dyes include acid fuchsin, eosin, and rose bengal. Figure 2.40 provides more detail.

Some staining techniques involve the application of only one dye to the sample; others require more than one dye.
In simple staining, a single dye is used to emphasize particular structures in the specimen. A simple stain will
generally make all of the organisms in a sample appear to be the same color, even if the sample contains more than
one type of organism. In contrast, differential staining distinguishes organisms based on their interactions with
multiple stains. In other words, two organisms in a differentially stained sample may appear to be different colors.
Differential staining techniques commonly used in clinical settings include Gram staining, acid-fast staining,
endospore staining, flagella staining, and capsule staining. Figure 2.41 provides more detail on these differential
staining techniques.

Gram Staining

The Gram stain procedure is a differential staining procedure that involves multiple steps. It was developed by
Danish microbiologist Hans Christian Gram in 1884 as an effective method to distinguish between bacteria with
different types of cell walls, and even today it remains one of the most frequently used staining techniques. The
steps of the Gram stain procedure are listed below and illustrated in Figure 2.33.

  1. First, crystal violet, a primary stain, is applied to a heat-fixed smear, giving all of the cells a purple color.
  2. Next, Gram's iodine, a mordant, is added. A mordant is a substance used to set or stabilize stains or dyes; in

        this case, Gram's iodine acts like a trapping agent that complexes with the crystal violet, making the crystal
        violet-iodine complex clump and stay contained in thick layers of peptidoglycan in the cell walls.
  3. Next, a decolorizing agent is added, usually ethanol or an acetone/ethanol solution. Cells that have thick
        peptidoglycan layers in their cell walls are much less affected by the decolorizing agent; they generally retain
        the crystal violet dye and remain purple. However, the decolorizing agent more easily washes the dye out of
        cells with thinner peptidoglycan layers, making them again colorless.
60  2 · How We See the Invisible World

    4. Finally, a secondary counterstain, usually safranin, is added. This stains the decolorized cells pink and is less
         noticeable in the cells that still contain the crystal violet dye.

    FIGURE 2.33 Gram-staining is a differential staining technique that uses a primary stain and a secondary counterstain to distinguish
    between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

    The purple, crystal-violet stained cells are referred to as gram-positive cells, while the red, safranin-dyed cells are
    gram-negative (Figure 2.34). However, there are several important considerations in interpreting the results of a
    Gram stain. First, older bacterial cells may have damage to their cell walls that causes them to appear gram-
    negative even if the species is gram-positive. Thus, it is best to use fresh bacterial cultures for Gram staining.
    Second, errors such as leaving the decolorizer on for too long can affect the results. For example, if the decolorizer is
    left on a slide of gram-positive bacteria a bit too long, most cells will appear gram-positive while a few will appear
    gram-negative. This suggests damage to the individual cells or that decolorizer was left on for too long; the cells
    should still be classified as gram-positive if they are all the same species rather than a mixed culture.
    Besides their differing interactions with dyes and decolorizing agents, the chemical differences between gram-
    positive and gram-negative cells have other implications with clinical relevance. For example, Gram staining can
    help clinicians classify bacterial pathogens in a sample into categories associated with specific properties. Gram-
    negative bacteria tend to be more resistant to certain antibiotics than gram-positive bacteria. We will discuss this
    and other applications of Gram staining in more detail in later chapters.

Viewing Cindy's specimen under the darkfield microscope has provided the technician with some important
clues about the identity of the microbe causing her infection. However, more information is needed to make a
conclusive diagnosis. The technician decides to make a Gram stain of the specimen. This technique is commonly
used as an early step in identifying pathogenic bacteria. After completing the Gram stain procedure, the
technician views the slide under the brightfield microscope and sees purple, grape-like clusters of spherical
cells (Figure 2.35).

Acid-Fast Stains

Acid-fast staining is another commonly used, differential staining technique that can be an important diagnostic
tool. An acid-fast stain is able to differentiate two types of gram-positive cells: those that have waxy mycolic acids
in their cell walls, and those that do not. Two different methods for acid-fast staining are the Ziehl-Neelsen
technique and the Kinyoun technique. Both use carbolfuchsin as the primary stain. The waxy, acid-fast cells retain
the carbolfuchsin even after a decolorizing agent (an acid-alcohol solution) is applied. A secondary counterstain,
methylene blue, is then applied, which renders non-acid-fast cells blue.

The fundamental difference between the two carbolfuchsin-based methods is whether heat is used during the
primary staining process. The Ziehl-Neelsen method uses heat to infuse the carbolfuchsin into the acid-fast cells,
whereas the Kinyoun method does not use heat. Both techniques are important diagnostic tools because a number
of specific diseases are caused by acid-fast bacteria (AFB). If AFB are present in a tissue sample, their red or pink
color can be seen clearly against the blue background of the surrounding tissue cells (Figure 2.36).

            MICRO CONNECTIONS

    Using Microscopy to Diagnose Tuberculosis

    Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, can be detected in specimens based on the
    presence of acid-fast bacilli. Tuberculosis infected immense portions of the global population throughout the 19th
    and 20th centuries, and much of the work of early microbiologists and other researchers was focused on the
    disease. Ruth Ella Moore, a prominent researcher who is known for work on blood typing, dental cavities, and gut
    microbiome, as well as for being the first Black woman to earn a natural science Ph.D., wrote her dissertation on
    new methods of isolating M. tuberculosis in order to better study it and develop a cure. These isolates would be
    critical in diagnosis and other medical procedures as well.

    Often, a smear is prepared from a sample of the patient's sputum and then stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen
    technique (Figure 2.36). If acid-fast bacteria are confirmed, they are generally cultured to make a positive
    identification. Variations of this approach can be used as a first step in determining whether M. tuberculosis or other
    acid-fast bacteria are present, though samples from elsewhere in the body (such as urine) may contain other
    Mycobacterium species.

    An alternative approach for determining the presence of M. tuberculosis is immunofluorescence. In this technique,
    fluorochrome-labeled antibodies bind to M. tuberculosis, if present. Antibody-specific fluorescent dyes can be used
    to view the mycobacteria with a fluorescence microscope.

    medium blue. (credit: modification of work by American Society for Microbiology)

    Capsule Staining

    Certain bacteria and yeasts have a protective outer structure called a capsule. Since the presence of a capsule is
    directly related to a microbe's virulence (its ability to cause disease), the ability to determine whether cells in a
    sample have capsules is an important diagnostic tool. Capsules do not absorb most basic dyes; therefore, a negative
    staining technique (staining around the cells) is typically used for capsule staining. The dye stains the background
    but does not penetrate the capsules, which appear like halos around the borders of the cell. The specimen does not
    need to be heat-fixed prior to negative staining.
    One common negative staining technique for identifying encapsulated yeast and bacteria is to add a few drops of
    India ink or nigrosin to a specimen. Other capsular stains can also be used to negatively stain encapsulated cells
    (Figure 2.37). Alternatively, positive and negative staining techniques can be combined to visualize capsules: The
    positive stain colors the body of the cell, and the negative stain colors the background but not the capsule, leaving

Endospore Staining

Endospores are structures produced within certain bacterial cells that allow them to survive harsh conditions. Gram
staining alone cannot be used to visualize endospores, which appear clear when Gram-stained cells are viewed.
Endospore staining uses two stains to differentiate endospores from the rest of the cell. The Schaeffer-Fulton
method (the most commonly used endospore-staining technique) uses heat to push the primary stain (malachite
green) into the endospore. Washing with water decolorizes the cell, but the endospore retains the green stain. The
cell is then counterstained pink with safranin. The resulting image reveals the shape and location of endospores, if
they are present. The green endospores will appear either within the pink vegetative cells or as separate from the
pink cells altogether. If no endospores are present, then only the pink vegetative cells will be visible (Figure 2.38).

Endospore-staining techniques are important for identifying Bacillus and Clostridium, two genera of endospore-
producing bacteria that contain clinically significant species. Among others, B. anthracis (which causes anthrax) has
been of particular interest because of concern that its spores could be used as a bioterrorism agent. C. difficile is a
particularly important species responsible for the typically hospital-acquired infection known as "C. diff."

    Flagella Staining

    Flagella (singular: flagellum) are tail-like cellular structures used for locomotion by some bacteria, archaea, and
    eukaryotes. Because they are so thin, flagella typically cannot be seen under a light microscope without a
    specialized flagella staining technique. Flagella staining thickens the flagella by first applying mordant (generally
    tannic acid, but sometimes potassium alum), which coats the flagella; then the specimen is stained with
    pararosaniline (most commonly) or basic fuchsin (Figure 2.39).

    FIGURE 2.39 A flagella stain of Bacillus cereus, a common cause of foodborne illness, reveals that the cells have numerous flagella, used
    for locomotion. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

    Though flagella staining is uncommon in clinical settings, the technique is commonly used by microbiologists, since
    the location and number of flagella can be useful in classifying and identifying bacteria in a sample. When using this
    technique, it is important to handle the specimen with great care; flagella are delicate structures that can easily be
    damaged or pulled off, compromising attempts to accurately locate and count the number of flagella.

Preparing Specimens for Electron Microscopy

Samples to be analyzed using a TEM must have very thin sections. But cells are too soft to cut thinly, even with
diamond knives. To cut cells without damage, the cells must be embedded in plastic resin and then dehydrated
through a series of soaks in ethanol solutions (50%, 60%, 70%, and so on). The ethanol replaces the water in the
66  2 · How We See the Invisible World

    cells, and the resin dissolves in ethanol and enters the cell, where it solidifies. Next, thin sections are cut using a
    specialized device called an ultramicrotome (Figure 2.42). Finally, samples are fixed to fine copper wire or carbon-
    fiber grids and stained--not with colored dyes, but with substances like uranyl acetate or osmium tetroxide, which
    contain electron-dense heavy metal atoms.

    thin sections. (credit a: modification of work by "Frost Museum"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
    Northeast Region)

    When samples are prepared for viewing using an SEM, they must also be dehydrated using an ethanol series.
    However, they must be even drier than is necessary for a TEM. Critical point drying with inert liquid carbon dioxide
    under pressure is used to displace the water from the specimen. After drying, the specimens are sputter-coated
    with metal by knocking atoms off of a palladium target, with energetic particles. Sputter-coating prevents
    specimens from becoming charged by the SEM's electron beam.

    Using Microscopy to Diagnose Syphilis

    The causative agent of syphilis is Treponema pallidum, a flexible, spiral cell (spirochete) that can be very thin (<0.15
    m) and match the refractive index of the medium, making it difficult to view using brightfield microscopy.
    Additionally, this species has not been successfully cultured in the laboratory on an artificial medium; therefore,
    diagnosis depends upon successful identification using microscopic techniques and serology (analysis of body
    fluids, often looking for antibodies to a pathogen). Since fixation and staining would kill the cells, darkfield
    microscopy is typically used for observing live specimens and viewing their movements. However, other approaches
    can also be used. For example, the cells can be thickened with silver particles (in tissue sections) and observed
    using a light microscope. It is also possible to use fluorescence or electron microscopy to view Treponema (Figure
    2.43).

FIGURE 2.43 (a) Living, unstained Treponema pallidum spirochetes can be viewed under a darkfield microscope. (b) In this brightfield
image, a modified Steiner silver stain is used to visualized T. pallidum spirochetes. Though the stain kills the cells, it increases the contrast
to make them more visible. (c) While not used for standard diagnostic testing, T. pallidum can also be examined using scanning electron
microscopy. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit b: modification of work by Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention; credit c: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

In clinical settings, indirect immunofluorescence is often used to identify Treponema. A primary, unstained antibody
attaches directly to the pathogen surface, and secondary antibodies "tagged" with a fluorescent stain attach to the
primary antibody. Multiple secondary antibodies can attach to each primary antibody, amplifying the amount of stain
attached to each Treponema cell, making them easier to spot (Figure 2.44).

         FIGURE 2.44 Indirect immunofluorescence can be used to identify T. pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, in a specimen.

Preparation and Staining for Other Microscopes

Samples for fluorescence and confocal microscopy are prepared similarly to samples for light microscopy, except
that the dyes are fluorochromes. Stains are often diluted in liquid before applying to the slide. Some dyes attach to
an antibody to stain specific proteins on specific types of cells (immunofluorescence); others may attach to DNA
molecules in a process called fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), causing cells to be stained based on whether
they have a specific DNA sequence.
Sample preparation for two-photon microscopy is similar to fluorescence microscopy, except for the use of infrared
dyes. Specimens for STM need to be on a very clean and atomically smooth surface. They are often mica coated with
Au(111). Toluene vapor is a common fixative.

    CLINICAL FOCUS

    Resolution

    From the results of the Gram stain, the technician now knows that Cindy's infection is caused by spherical,
    gram-positive bacteria that form grape-like clusters, which is typical of staphylococcal bacteria. After some
    additional testing, the technician determines that these bacteria are the medically important species known as
    Staphylococcus aureus, a common culprit in wound infections. Because some strains of S. aureus are resistant
    to many antibiotics, skin infections may spread to other areas of the body and become serious, sometimes even
    resulting in amputations or death if the correct antibiotics are not used.

    After testing several antibiotics, the lab is able to identify one that is effective against this particular strain of S.
    aureus. Cindy's doctor quickly prescribes the medication and emphasizes the importance of taking the entire
    course of antibiotics, even if the infection appears to clear up before the last scheduled dose. This reduces the
    risk that any especially resistant bacteria could survive, causing a second infection or spreading to another
    person.

    Go back to the previous Clinical Focus box.

    EYE ON ETHICS

    Microscopy and Antibiotic Resistance

    As the use of antibiotics has proliferated in medicine, as well as agriculture, microbes have evolved to become
    more resistant. Strains of bacteria such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which has developed a high
    level of resistance to many antibiotics, are an increasingly worrying problem, so much so that research is
    underway to develop new and more diversified antibiotics.

    Fluorescence microscopy can be useful in testing the effectiveness of new antibiotics against resistant strains
    like MRSA. In a test of one new antibiotic derived from a marine bacterium, MC21-A (bromophene), researchers
    used the fluorescent dye SYTOX Green to stain samples of MRSA. SYTOX Green is often used to distinguish dead
    cells from living cells, with fluorescence microscopy. Live cells will not absorb the dye, but cells killed by an
    antibiotic will absorb the dye, since the antibiotic has damaged the bacterial cell membrane. In this particular
    case, MRSA bacteria that had been exposed to MC21-A did, indeed, appear green under the fluorescence
    microscope, leading researchers to conclude that it is an effective antibiotic against MRSA.

    Of course, some argue that developing new antibiotics will only lead to even more antibiotic-resistant microbes,
    so-called superbugs that could spawn epidemics before new treatments can be developed. For this reason,
    many health professionals are beginning to exercise more discretion in prescribing antibiotics. Whereas
    antibiotics were once routinely prescribed for common illnesses without a definite diagnosis, doctors and
    hospitals are much more likely to conduct additional testing to determine whether an antibiotic is necessary and
    appropriate before prescribing.

    A sick patient might reasonably object to this stingy approach to prescribing antibiotics. To the patient who
    simply wants to feel better as quickly as possible, the potential benefits of taking an antibiotic may seem to
    outweigh any immediate health risks that might occur if the antibiotic is ineffective. But at what point do the
    risks of widespread antibiotic use supersede the desire to use them in individual cases?

3.4 Unique Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells

INTRODUCTION Life takes many forms, from giant redwood trees towering hundreds of feet in the air to the tiniest
known microbes, which measure only a few billionths of a meter. Humans have long pondered life's origins and
debated the defining characteristics of life, but our understanding of these concepts has changed radically since the
invention of the microscope. In the 17th century, observations of microscopic life led to the development of the cell
theory: the idea that the fundamental unit of life is the cell, that all organisms contain at least one cell, and that cells
only come from other cells.
Despite sharing certain characteristics, cells may vary significantly. The two main types of cells are prokaryotic cells
(lacking a nucleus) and eukaryotic cells (containing a well-organized, membrane-bound nucleus). Each type of cell
exhibits remarkable variety in structure, function, and metabolic activity (Figure 3.1). This chapter will focus on the
historical discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of microbes, including their origins and their role
in human disease. We will then explore the distinguishing structures found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

      CLINICAL FOCUS

      Part 1

      Barbara is a 19-year-old college student living in the dormitory. In January, she came down with a sore throat,
      headache, mild fever, chills, and a violent but unproductive (i.e., no mucus) cough. To treat these symptoms,
      Barbara began taking an over-the-counter cold medication, which did not seem to work. In fact, over the next
      few days, while some of Barbara's symptoms began to resolve, her cough and fever persisted, and she felt very
      tired and weak.

    Humans have been asking for millennia: Where does new life come from? Religion, philosophy, and science have all
    wrestled with this question. One of the oldest explanations was the theory of spontaneous generation, which can be
    traced back to the ancient Greeks and was widely accepted through the Middle Ages.

    The Theory of Spontaneous Generation

    The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) was one of the earliest recorded scholars to articulate the theory of
    spontaneous generation, the notion that life can arise from nonliving matter. Aristotle proposed that life arose from
    nonliving material if the material contained pneuma ("spirit" or "breath"). As evidence, he noted several instances of
    the appearance of animals from environments previously devoid of such animals, such as the seemingly sudden
    appearance of fish in a new puddle of water.1

    This theory persisted into the 17th century, when scientists undertook additional experimentation to support or
    disprove it. By this time, the proponents of the theory cited how frogs simply seem to appear along the muddy banks
    of the Nile River in Egypt during the annual flooding. Others observed that mice simply appeared among grain stored
    in barns with thatched roofs. When the roof leaked and the grain molded, mice appeared. Jan Baptista van Helmont,
    a 17th century Flemish scientist, proposed that mice could arise from rags and wheat kernels left in an open
    container for 3 weeks. In reality, such habitats provided ideal food sources and shelter for mouse populations to
    flourish.

    However, one of van Helmont's contemporaries, Italian physician Francesco Redi (1626-1697), performed an
    experiment in 1668 that was one of the first to refute the idea that maggots (the larvae of flies) spontaneously
    generate on meat left out in the open air. He predicted that preventing flies from having direct contact with the meat
    would also prevent the appearance of maggots. Redi left meat in each of six containers (Figure 3.2). Two were open
    to the air, two were covered with gauze, and two were tightly sealed. His hypothesis was supported when maggots
    developed in the uncovered jars, but no maggots appeared in either the gauze-covered or the tightly sealed jars. He
    concluded that maggots could only form when flies were allowed to lay eggs in the meat, and that the maggots were
    the offspring of flies, not the product of spontaneous generation.

FIGURE 3.2 Francesco Redi's experimental setup consisted of an open container, a container sealed with a cork top, and a container
covered in mesh that let in air but not flies. Maggots only appeared on the meat in the open container. However, maggots were also found
on the gauze of the gauze-covered container.

In 1745, John Needham (1713-1781) published a report of his own experiments, in which he briefly boiled broth
infused with plant or animal matter, hoping to kill all preexisting microbes.2 He then sealed the flasks. After a few
days, Needham observed that the broth had become cloudy and a single drop contained numerous microscopic
creatures. He argued that the new microbes must have arisen spontaneously. In reality, however, he likely did not
boil the broth enough to kill all preexisting microbes.
Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799) did not agree with Needham's conclusions, however, and performed hundreds of
carefully executed experiments using heated broth.3 As in Needham's experiment, broth in sealed jars and
unsealed jars was infused with plant and animal matter. Spallanzani's results contradicted the findings of Needham:
Heated but sealed flasks remained clear, without any signs of spontaneous growth, unless the flasks were
subsequently opened to the air. This suggested that microbes were introduced into these flasks from the air. In
response to Spallanzani's findings, Needham argued that life originates from a "life force" that was destroyed during
Spallanzani's extended boiling. Any subsequent sealing of the flasks then prevented new life force from entering and
causing spontaneous generation (Figure 3.3).

    Disproving Spontaneous Generation

    The debate over spontaneous generation continued well into the 19th century, with scientists serving as proponents
    of both sides. To settle the debate, the Paris Academy of Sciences offered a prize for resolution of the problem. Louis
    Pasteur, a prominent French chemist who had been studying microbial fermentation and the causes of wine
    spoilage, accepted the challenge. In 1858, Pasteur filtered air through a gun-cotton filter and, upon microscopic
    examination of the cotton, found it full of microorganisms, suggesting that the exposure of a broth to air was not
    introducing a "life force" to the broth but rather airborne microorganisms.

    Later, Pasteur made a series of flasks with long, twisted necks ("swan-neck" flasks), in which he boiled broth to
    sterilize it (Figure 3.4). His design allowed air inside the flasks to be exchanged with air from the outside, but
    prevented the introduction of any airborne microorganisms, which would get caught in the twists and bends of the
    flasks' necks. If a life force besides the airborne microorganisms were responsible for microbial growth within the
    sterilized flasks, it would have access to the broth, whereas the microorganisms would not. He correctly predicted
    that sterilized broth in his swan-neck flasks would remain sterile as long as the swan necks remained intact.
    However, should the necks be broken, microorganisms would be introduced, contaminating the flasks and allowing
    microbial growth within the broth.

    Pasteur's set of experiments irrefutably disproved the theory of spontaneous generation and earned him the
    prestigious Alhumbert Prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1862. In a subsequent lecture in 1864, Pasteur
    articulated "Omne vivum ex vivo" ("Life only comes from life"). In this lecture, Pasteur recounted his famous swan-
    neck flask experiment, stating that "...life is a germ and a germ is life. Never will the doctrine of spontaneous
    generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment."4 To Pasteur's credit, it never has.

        theory

While some scientists were arguing over the theory of spontaneous generation, other scientists were making
discoveries leading to a better understanding of what we now call the cell theory. Modern cell theory has two basic
78  3 · The Cell

    tenets:

        · All cells only come from other cells (the principle of biogenesis).
        · Cells are the fundamental units of organisms.

    Today, these tenets are fundamental to our understanding of life on earth. However, modern cell theory grew out of
    the collective work of many scientists.

    The Origins of Cell Theory

    The English scientist Robert Hooke first used the term "cells" in 1665 to describe the small chambers within cork
    that he observed under a microscope of his own design. To Hooke, thin sections of cork resembled "Honey-comb,"
    or "small Boxes or Bladders of Air." He noted that each "Cavern, Bubble, or Cell" was distinct from the others (Figure
    3.5). At the time, Hooke was not aware that the cork cells were long dead and, therefore, lacked the internal
    structures found within living cells.

    FIGURE 3.5 Robert Hooke (1635-1703) was the first to describe cells based upon his microscopic observations of cork. This illustration
    was published in his work Micrographia.

    Despite Hooke's early description of cells, their significance as the fundamental unit of life was not yet recognized.
    Nearly 200 years later, in 1838, Matthias Schleiden (1804-1881), a German botanist who made extensive
    microscopic observations of plant tissues, described them as being composed of cells. Visualizing plant cells was
    relatively easy because plant cells are clearly separated by their thick cell walls. Schleiden believed that cells
    formed through crystallization, rather than cell division.
    Theodor Schwann (1810-1882), a noted German physiologist, made similar microscopic observations of animal
    tissue. In 1839, after a conversation with Schleiden, Schwann realized that similarities existed between plant and
    animal tissues. This laid the foundation for the idea that cells are the fundamental components of plants and
    animals.
    In the 1850s, two Polish scientists living in Germany pushed this idea further, culminating in what we recognize
    today as the modern cell theory. In 1852, Robert Remak (1815-1865), a prominent neurologist and embryologist,
    published convincing evidence that cells are derived from other cells as a result of cell division. However, this idea
    was questioned by many in the scientific community. Three years later, Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), a well-
    respected pathologist, published an editorial essay entitled "Cellular Pathology," which popularized the concept of
    cell theory using the Latin phrase omnis cellula a cellula ("all cells arise from cells"), which is essentially the second
    tenet of modern cell theory.5 Given the similarity of Virchow's work to Remak's, there is some controversy as to
    which scientist should receive credit for articulating cell theory. See the following Eye on Ethics feature for more
    about this controversy.

EYE ON ETHICS

Science and Plagiarism

Rudolf Virchow, a prominent, Polish-born, German scientist, is often remembered as the "Father of Pathology."
Well known for innovative approaches, he was one of the first to determine the causes of various diseases by
examining their effects on tissues and organs. He was also among the first to use animals in his research and, as
a result of his work, he was the first to name numerous diseases and created many other medical terms. Over
the course of his career, he published more than 2,000 papers and headed various important medical facilities,
including the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, a prominent Berlin hospital and medical school. But he is,
perhaps, best remembered for his 1855 editorial essay titled "Cellular Pathology," published in Archiv für
Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie, a journal that Virchow himself cofounded and still exists today.

Despite his significant scientific legacy, there is some controversy regarding this essay, in which Virchow
proposed the central tenet of modern cell theory--that all cells arise from other cells. Robert Remak, a former
colleague who worked in the same laboratory as Virchow at the University of Berlin, had published the same
idea 3 years before. Though it appears Virchow was familiar with Remak's work, he neglected to credit Remak's
ideas in his essay. When Remak wrote a letter to Virchow pointing out similarities between Virchow's ideas and
his own, Virchow was dismissive. In 1858, in the preface to one of his books, Virchow wrote that his 1855
publication was just an editorial piece, not a scientific paper, and thus there was no need to cite Remak's work.

By today's standards, Virchow's editorial piece would certainly be considered an act of plagiarism, since he
presented Remak's ideas as his own. However, in the 19th century, standards for academic integrity were much
less clear. Virchow's strong reputation, coupled with the fact that Remak was a Jew in a somewhat anti-Semitic
political climate, shielded him from any significant repercussions. Today, the process of peer review and the
ease of access to the scientific literature help discourage plagiarism. Although scientists are still motivated to
publish original ideas that advance scientific knowledge, those who would consider plagiarizing are well aware
of the serious consequences.

In academia, plagiarism represents the theft of both individual thought and research--an offense that can
destroy reputations and end careers.6 7 8 9

    Endosymbiotic Theory

    As scientists were making progress toward understanding the role of cells in plant and animal tissues, others were
    examining the structures within the cells themselves. In 1831, Scottish botanist Robert Brown (1773-1858) was
    the first to describe observations of nuclei, which he observed in plant cells. Then, in the early 1880s, German
    botanist Andreas Schimper (1856-1901) was the first to describe the chloroplasts of plant cells, identifying their
    role in starch formation during photosynthesis and noting that they divided independent of the nucleus.

    Based upon the chloroplasts' ability to reproduce independently, Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowski
    (1855-1921) suggested in 1905 that chloroplasts may have originated from ancestral photosynthetic bacteria living
    symbiotically inside a eukaryotic cell. He proposed a similar origin for the nucleus of plant cells. This was the first
    articulation of the endosymbiotic hypothesis, and would explain how eukaryotic cells evolved from ancestral
    bacteria.

    Mereschkowski's endosymbiotic hypothesis was furthered by American anatomist Ivan Wallin (1883-1969), who
    began to experimentally examine the similarities between mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria--in other words,
    to put the endosymbiotic hypothesis to the test using objective investigation. Wallin published a series of papers in
    the 1920s supporting the endosymbiotic hypothesis, including a 1926 publication co-authored with Mereschkowski.
    Wallin claimed he could culture mitochondria outside of their eukaryotic host cells. Many scientists dismissed his
    cultures of mitochondria as resulting from bacterial contamination. Modern genome sequencing work supports the
    dissenting scientists by showing that much of the genome of mitochondria had been transferred to the host cell's
    nucleus, preventing the mitochondria from being able to live on their own.10 11

    Wallin's ideas regarding the endosymbiotic hypothesis were largely ignored for the next 50 years because scientists
    were unaware that these organelles contained their own DNA. However, with the discovery of mitochondrial and
    chloroplast DNA in the 1960s, the endosymbiotic hypothesis was resurrected. Lynn Margulis (1938-2011), an
    American geneticist, published her ideas regarding the endosymbiotic hypothesis of the origins of mitochondria and
    chloroplasts in 1967.12 In the decade leading up to her publication, advances in microscopy had allowed scientists
    to differentiate prokaryotic cells from eukaryotic cells. In her publication, Margulis reviewed the literature and
    argued that the eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts are of prokaryotic origin. She
    presented a growing body of microscopic, genetic, molecular biology, fossil, and geological data to support her
    claims.

Again, this hypothesis was not initially popular, but mounting genetic evidence due to the advent of DNA sequencing
supported the endosymbiotic theory, which is now defined as the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts arose
as a result of prokaryotic cells establishing a symbiotic relationship within a eukaryotic host (Figure 3.7). With
Margulis' initial endosymbiotic theory gaining wide acceptance, she expanded on the theory in her 1981 book
Symbiosis in Cell Evolution. In it, she explains how endosymbiosis is a major driving factor in the evolution of
organisms. More recent genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis show that mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast
DNA are highly related to their bacterial counterparts, both in DNA sequence and chromosome structure. However,
mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA are reduced compared with nuclear DNA because many of the genes have
moved from the organelles into the host cell's nucleus. Additionally, mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes are
structurally similar to bacterial ribosomes, rather than to the eukaryotic ribosomes of their hosts. Last, the binary
fission of these organelles strongly resembles the binary fission of bacteria, as compared with mitosis performed by
eukaryotic cells. Since Margulis' original proposal, scientists have observed several examples of bacterial
endosymbionts in modern-day eukaryotic cells. Examples include the endosymbiotic bacteria found within the guts
of certain insects, such as cockroaches,13 and photosynthetic bacteria-like organelles found in protists.14

FIGURE 3.7 According to the endosymbiotic theory, mitochondria and chloroplasts are each derived from the uptake of bacteria. These
bacteria established a symbiotic relationship with their host cell that eventually led to the bacteria evolving into mitochondria and
chloroplasts.

The Germ Theory of Disease

Prior to the discovery of microbes during the 17th century, other theories circulated about the origins of disease. For
example, the ancient Greeks proposed the miasma theory, which held that disease originated from particles
emanating from decomposing matter, such as that in sewage or cesspits. Such particles infected humans in close
proximity to the rotting material. Diseases including the Black Death, which ravaged Europe's population during the
Middle Ages, were thought to have originated in this way. In the 11th Century, Persian physician Ibn Sina

    (sometimes referred to as Avicenna) proposed that tuberculosis was likely spread by people's breath when in close
    proximity. Arab physician Ibn Zuhr, writing in about 1155, documented that the common skin condition scabies was
    caused by tiny mites that bored into the skin. Though scabies mites are about half a millimeter long (and therefore
    not technically microscopic) and their skin tunnels are often visible, Ibn Zuhr's discovery gave more evidence that
    unseen substances or creatures caused diseases.

    In 1546, Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro proposed, in his essay De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis, that
    seed-like spores may be transferred between individuals through direct contact, exposure to contaminated clothing,
    or through the air. We now recognize Fracastoro as an early proponent of the germ theory of disease, which states
    that diseases may result from microbial infection. However, in the 16th century, Fracastoro's ideas were not widely
    accepted and would be largely forgotten until the 19th century.

    In 1847, Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis (Figure 3.8) observed that people who gave birth in hospital
    wards staffed by physicians and medical students were more likely to suffer and die from puerperal fever after
    childbirth (10%-20% mortality rate) than were people in wards staffed by midwives (1% mortality rate).
    Semmelweis observed medical students performing autopsies and then subsequently carrying out vaginal
    examinations on living patients without washing their hands in between. He suspected that the students carried
    disease from the autopsies to the patients they examined. His suspicions were supported by the untimely death of a
    friend, a physician who contracted a fatal wound infection after a postmortem examination of a woman who had
    died of a puerperal infection. The dead physician's wound had been caused by a scalpel used during the
    examination, and his subsequent illness and death closely paralleled that of the dead patient.

    Although Semmelweis did not know the true cause of puerperal fever, he proposed that physicians were somehow
    transferring the causative agent to their patients. He suggested that the number of puerperal fever cases could be
    reduced if physicians and medical students simply washed their hands with chlorinated lime water before and after
    examining every patient. When this practice was implemented, the maternal mortality rate in people cared for by
    physicians dropped to the same 1% mortality rate observed among people cared for by midwives. This
    demonstrated that handwashing was a very effective method for preventing disease transmission. Despite this great
    success, many discounted Semmelweis's work at the time, and physicians were slow to adopt the simple procedure
    of handwashing to prevent infections in their patients because it contradicted established norms for that time
    period.

    FIGURE 3.8 Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-1865) was a proponent of the importance of handwashing to prevent transfer of disease between
    patients by physicians.

    Around the same time Semmelweis was promoting handwashing, in 1848, British physician John Snow conducted
    studies to track the source of cholera outbreaks in London. By tracing the outbreaks to two specific water sources,
    both of which were contaminated by sewage, Snow ultimately demonstrated that cholera bacteria were transmitted
    via drinking water. Snow's work is influential in that it represents the first known epidemiological study, and it
    resulted in the first known public health response to an epidemic. The work of both Semmelweis and Snow clearly
    refuted the prevailing miasma theory of the day, showing that disease is not only transmitted through the air but
    also through contaminated items.

Although the work of Semmelweis and Snow successfully showed the role of sanitation in preventing infectious
disease, the cause of disease was not fully understood. The subsequent work of Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, and
Joseph Lister would further substantiate the germ theory of disease.

While studying the causes of beer and wine spoilage in 1856, Pasteur discovered properties of fermentation by
microorganisms. He had demonstrated with his swan-neck flask experiments (Figure 3.4) that airborne microbes,
not spontaneous generation, were the cause of food spoilage, and he suggested that if microbes were responsible
for food spoilage and fermentation, they could also be responsible for causing infection. This was the foundation for
the germ theory of disease.

Meanwhile, British surgeon Joseph Lister (Figure 3.9) was trying to determine the causes of postsurgical infections.
Many physicians did not give credence to the idea that microbes on their hands, on their clothes, or in the air could
infect patients' surgical wounds, despite the fact that 50% of surgical patients, on average, were dying of
postsurgical infections.15 Lister, however, was familiar with the work of Semmelweis and Pasteur; therefore, he
insisted on handwashing and extreme cleanliness during surgery. In 1867, to further decrease the incidence of
postsurgical wound infections, Lister began using carbolic acid (phenol) spray disinfectant/antiseptic during surgery.
His extremely successful efforts to reduce postsurgical infection caused his techniques to become a standard
medical practice.

A few years later, Robert Koch (Figure 3.9) proposed a series of postulates (Koch's postulates) based on the idea
that the cause of a specific disease could be attributed to a specific microbe. Using these postulates, Koch and his
colleagues were able to definitively identify the causative pathogens of specific diseases, including anthrax,
tuberculosis, and cholera. Koch's "one microbe, one disease" concept was the culmination of the 19th century's
paradigm shift away from miasma theory and toward the germ theory of disease. Koch's postulates are discussed
more thoroughly in How Pathogens Cause Disease.

    her symptoms could be due to a range of diseases, such as influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis.

    During her physical examination, the PA notes that Barbara's heart rate is slightly elevated. Using a pulse
    oximeter, a small device that clips on her finger, he finds that Barbara has hypoxemia--a lower-than-normal level
    of oxygen in the blood. Using a stethoscope, the PA listens for abnormal sounds made by Barbara's heart, lungs,
    and digestive system. As Barbara breathes, the PA hears a crackling sound and notes a slight shortness of
    breath. He collects a sputum sample, noting the greenish color of the mucus, and orders a chest radiograph,
    which shows a "shadow" in the left lung. All of these signs are suggestive of pneumonia, a condition in which the
    lungs fill with mucus (Figure 3.10).

3.3 Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the distinguishing characteristics of prokaryotic cells
    · Describe common cell morphologies and cellular arrangements typical of prokaryotic cells and explain

        how cells maintain their morphology
    · Describe internal and external structures of prokaryotic cells in terms of their physical structure, chemical

        structure, and function
    · Compare the distinguishing characteristics of bacterial and archaeal cells

Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life. However, cells vary significantly in size, shape,
structure, and function. At the simplest level of construction, all cells possess a few fundamental components.
These include cytoplasm (a gel-like substance composed of water and dissolved chemicals needed for growth),
which is contained within a plasma membrane (also called a cell membrane or cytoplasmic membrane); one or
more chromosomes, which contain the genetic blueprints of the cell; and ribosomes, organelles used for the
production of proteins.

Beyond these basic components, cells can vary greatly between organisms, and even within the same multicellular
organism. The two largest categories of cells--prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells--are defined by major
differences in several cell structures. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus surrounded by a complex nuclear membrane
and generally have a single, circular chromosome located in a nucleoid. Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus surrounded
by a complex nuclear membrane that contains multiple, rod-shaped chromosomes.16

All plant cells and animal cells are eukaryotic. Some microorganisms are composed of prokaryotic cells, whereas

86  3 · The Cell

    others are composed of eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic microorganisms are classified within the domains Archaea and
    Bacteria, whereas eukaryotic organisms are classified within the domain Eukarya.

    The structures inside a cell are analogous to the organs inside a human body, with unique structures suited to
    specific functions. Some of the structures found in prokaryotic cells are similar to those found in some eukaryotic
    cells; others are unique to prokaryotes. Although there are some exceptions, eukaryotic cells tend to be larger than
    prokaryotic cells. The comparatively larger size of eukaryotic cells dictates the need to compartmentalize various
    chemical processes within different areas of the cell, using complex membrane-bound organelles. In contrast,
    prokaryotic cells generally lack membrane-bound organelles; however, they often contain inclusions that
    compartmentalize their cytoplasm. Figure 3.12 illustrates structures typically associated with prokaryotic cells.
    These structures are described in more detail in the next section.

    FIGURE 3.12 A typical prokaryotic cell contains a cell membrane, chromosomal DNA that is concentrated in a nucleoid, ribosomes, and a
    cell wall. Some prokaryotic cells may also possess flagella, pili, fimbriae, and capsules.

    Common Cell Morphologies and Arrangements

    Individual cells of a particular prokaryotic organism are typically similar in shape, or cell morphology. Although
    thousands of prokaryotic organisms have been identified, only a handful of cell morphologies are commonly seen
    microscopically. Figure 3.13 names and illustrates cell morphologies commonly found in prokaryotic cells. In
    addition to cellular shape, prokaryotic cells of the same species may group together in certain distinctive
    arrangements depending on the plane of cell division. Some common arrangements are shown in Figure 3.14.

    In most prokaryotic cells, morphology is maintained by the cell wall in combination with cytoskeletal elements. The
    cell wall is a structure found in most prokaryotes and some eukaryotes; it envelopes the cell membrane, protecting
    the cell from changes in osmotic pressure (Figure 3.15). Osmotic pressure occurs because of differences in the
    concentration of solutes on opposing sides of a semipermeable membrane. Water is able to pass through a
    semipermeable membrane, but solutes (dissolved molecules like salts, sugars, and other compounds) cannot.
    When the concentration of solutes is greater on one side of the membrane, water diffuses across the membrane
    from the side with the lower concentration (more water) to the side with the higher concentration (less water) until
    the concentrations on both sides become equal. This diffusion of water is called osmosis, and it can cause extreme
    osmotic pressure on a cell when its external environment changes.

    The external environment of a cell can be described as an isotonic, hypertonic, or hypotonic medium. In an isotonic
    medium, the solute concentrations inside and outside the cell are approximately equal, so there is no net
    movement of water across the cell membrane. In a hypertonic medium, the solute concentration outside the cell
    exceeds that inside the cell, so water diffuses out of the cell and into the external medium. In a hypotonic medium,
    the solute concentration inside the cell exceeds that outside of the cell, so water will move by osmosis into the cell.
    This causes the cell to swell and potentially lyse, or burst.

    The degree to which a particular cell is able to withstand changes in osmotic pressure is called tonicity. Cells that
    have a cell wall are better able to withstand subtle changes in osmotic pressure and maintain their shape. In
    hypertonic environments, cells that lack a cell wall can become dehydrated, causing crenation, or shriveling of the
    cell; the plasma membrane contracts and appears scalloped or notched (Figure 3.15). By contrast, cells that
    possess a cell wall undergo plasmolysis rather than crenation. In plasmolysis, the plasma membrane contracts and
    detaches from the cell wall, and there is a decrease in interior volume, but the cell wall remains intact, thus allowing

the cell to maintain some shape and integrity for a period of time (Figure 3.16). Likewise, cells that lack a cell wall
are more prone to lysis in hypotonic environments. The presence of a cell wall allows the cell to maintain its shape
and integrity for a longer time before lysing (Figure 3.16).

FIGURE 3.15 In cells that lack a cell wall, changes in osmotic pressure can lead to crenation in hypertonic environments or cell lysis in
hypotonic environments.

FIGURE 3.16 In prokaryotic cells, the cell wall provides some protection against changes in osmotic pressure, allowing it to maintain its
shape longer. The cell membrane is typically attached to the cell wall in an isotonic medium (left). In a hypertonic medium, the cell
membrane detaches from the cell wall and contracts (plasmolysis) as water leaves the cell. In a hypotonic medium (right), the cell wall
prevents the cell membrane from expanding to the point of bursting, although lysis will eventually occur if too much water is absorbed.

The Nucleoid

All cellular life has a DNA genome organized into one or more chromosomes. Prokaryotic chromosomes are typically
circular, haploid (unpaired), and not bound by a complex nuclear membrane. Prokaryotic DNA and DNA-associated
90  3 · The Cell

    proteins are concentrated within the nucleoid region of the cell (Figure 3.17). In general, prokaryotic DNA interacts
    with nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) that assist in the organization and packaging of the chromosome. In
    bacteria, NAPs function similar to histones, which are the DNA-organizing proteins found in eukaryotic cells. In
    archaea, the nucleoid is organized by either NAPs or histone-like DNA organizing proteins.

    FIGURE 3.17 The nucleoid region (the area enclosed by the green dashed line) is a condensed area of DNA found within prokaryotic cells.
    Because of the density of the area, it does not readily stain and appears lighter in color when viewed with a transmission electron
    microscope.

    Plasmids

    Prokaryotic cells may also contain extrachromosomal DNA, or DNA that is not part of the chromosome. This
    extrachromosomal DNA is found in plasmids, which are small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules. Cells that
    have plasmids often have hundreds of them within a single cell. Plasmids are more commonly found in bacteria;
    however, plasmids have been found in archaea and eukaryotic organisms. Plasmids often carry genes that confer
    advantageous traits such as antibiotic resistance; thus, they are important to the survival of the organism. We will
    discuss plasmids in more detail in Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics.

    Ribosomes

    All cellular life synthesizes proteins, and organisms in all three domains of life possess ribosomes, structures
    responsible for protein synthesis. However, ribosomes in each of the three domains are structurally different.
    Ribosomes, themselves, are constructed from proteins, along with ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Prokaryotic ribosomes
    are found in the cytoplasm. They are called 70S ribosomes because they have a size of 70S (Figure 3.18), whereas
    eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes have a size of 80S. (The S stands for Svedberg unit, a measure of sedimentation
    in an ultracentrifuge, which is based on size, shape, and surface qualities of the structure being analyzed). Although
    they are the same size, bacterial and archaeal ribosomes have different proteins and rRNA molecules, and the
    archaeal versions are more similar to their eukaryotic counterparts than to those found in bacteria.

    FIGURE 3.18 Prokaryotic ribosomes (70S) are composed of two subunits: the 30S (small subunit) and the 50S (large subunit), each of
    which are composed of protein and rRNA components.

    Inclusions

    As single-celled organisms living in unstable environments, some prokaryotic cells have the ability to store excess
    nutrients within cytoplasmic structures called inclusions. Storing nutrients in a polymerized form is advantageous
    because it reduces the buildup of osmotic pressure that occurs as a cell accumulates solutes. Various types of
    inclusions store glycogen and starches, which contain carbon that cells can access for energy. Volutin granules, also
    called metachromatic granules because of their staining characteristics, are inclusions that store polymerized
    inorganic phosphate that can be used in metabolism and assist in the formation of biofilms. Microbes known to
    contain volutin granules include the archaea Methanosarcina, the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and the
    unicellular eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas. Sulfur granules, another type of inclusion, are found in sulfur bacteria
    of the genus Thiobacillus; these granules store elemental sulfur, which the bacteria use for metabolism.
    Occasionally, certain types of inclusions are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer embedded with protein.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which can be produced by species of Bacillus and Pseudomonas, is an example of an
inclusion that displays this type of monolayer structure. Industrially, PHB has also been used as a source of
biodegradable polymers for bioplastics. Several different types of inclusions are shown in Figure 3.19.

Society for Microbiology)

Some prokaryotic cells have other types of inclusions that serve purposes other than nutrient storage. For example,
some prokaryotic cells produce gas vacuoles, accumulations of small, protein-lined vesicles of gas. These gas
vacuoles allow the prokaryotic cells that synthesize them to alter their buoyancy so that they can adjust their
location in the water column. Magnetotactic bacteria, such as Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, contain
magnetosomes, which are inclusions of magnetic iron oxide or iron sulfide surrounded by a lipid layer. These allow
cells to align along a magnetic field, aiding their movement (Figure 3.19). Cyanobacteria such as Anabaena
cylindrica and bacteria such as Halothiobacillus neapolitanus produce carboxysome inclusions. Carboxysomes are
composed of outer shells of thousands of protein subunits. Their interior is filled with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase. Both of these compounds are used for carbon
metabolism. Some prokaryotic cells also possess carboxysomes that sequester functionally related enzymes in one
location. These structures are considered proto-organelles because they compartmentalize important compounds
or chemical reactions, much like many eukaryotic organelles.

Endospores

Bacterial cells are generally observed as vegetative cells, but some genera of bacteria have the ability to form
endospores, structures that essentially protect the bacterial genome in a dormant state when environmental
conditions are unfavorable. Endospores (not to be confused with the reproductive spores formed by fungi) allow
some bacterial cells to survive long periods without food or water, as well as exposure to chemicals, extreme
temperatures, and even radiation. Table 3.1 compares the characteristics of vegetative cells and endospores.

    The process by which vegetative cells transform into endospores is called sporulation, and it generally begins when
    nutrients become depleted or environmental conditions become otherwise unfavorable (Figure 3.20). The process
    begins with the formation of a septum in the vegetative bacterial cell. The septum divides the cell asymmetrically,
    separating a DNA forespore from the mother cell. The forespore, which will form the core of the endospore, is
    essentially a copy of the cell's chromosomes, and is separated from the mother cell by a second membrane. A
    cortex gradually forms around the forespore by laying down layers of calcium and dipicolinic acid between
    membranes. A protein coat then forms around the cortex while the DNA of the mother cell disintegrates. Further
    maturation of the endospore occurs with the formation of an outermost exosporium. The endospore is released
    upon disintegration of the mother cell, completing sporulation.

    FIGURE 3.20 (a) Sporulation begins following asymmetric cell division. The forespore becomes surrounded by a double layer of membrane,
    a cortex, and a protein coat, before being released as a mature endospore upon disintegration of the mother cell. (b) An electron

Endospores of certain species have been shown to persist in a dormant state for extended periods of time, up to
thousands of years.17 However, when living conditions improve, endospores undergo germination, reentering a
vegetative state. After germination, the cell becomes metabolically active again and is able to carry out all of its
normal functions, including growth and cell division.

Not all bacteria have the ability to form endospores; however, there are a number of clinically significant endospore-
forming gram-positive bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. These include B. anthracis, the causative
agent of anthrax, which produces endospores capable of surviving for many decades18 ; C. tetani (causes tetanus);
C. difficile (causes pseudomembranous colitis); C. perfringens (causes gas gangrene); and C. botulinum (causes
botulism). Pathogens such as these are particularly difficult to combat because their endospores are so hard to kill.
Special sterilization methods for endospore-forming bacteria are discussed in Control of Microbial Growth.

Plasma Membrane

Structures that enclose the cytoplasm and internal structures of the cell are known collectively as the cell envelope.
In prokaryotic cells, the structures of the cell envelope vary depending on the type of cell and organism. Most (but
not all) prokaryotic cells have a cell wall, but the makeup of this cell wall varies. All cells (prokaryotic and eukaryotic)
have a plasma membrane (also called cytoplasmic membrane or cell membrane) that exhibits selective
permeability, allowing some molecules to enter or leave the cell while restricting the passage of others.

The structure of the plasma membrane is often described in terms of the fluid mosaic model, which refers to the
ability of membrane components to move fluidly within the plane of the membrane, as well as the mosaic-like
composition of the components, which include a diverse array of lipid and protein components (Figure 3.21). The
plasma membrane structure of most bacterial and eukaryotic cell types is a bilayer composed mainly of
phospholipids formed with ester linkages and proteins. These phospholipids and proteins have the ability to move
laterally within the plane of the membranes as well as between the two phospholipid layers.

    for the cell. Note the presence of glycoproteins and glycolipids, whose carbohydrate components extend out from the surface of the cell.
    The abundance and arrangement of these proteins and lipids can vary greatly between species.

    Archaeal membranes are fundamentally different from bacterial and eukaryotic membranes in a few significant
    ways. First, archaeal membrane phospholipids are formed with ether linkages, in contrast to the ester linkages
    found in bacterial or eukaryotic cell membranes. Second, archaeal phospholipids have branched chains, whereas
    those of bacterial and eukaryotic cells are straight chained. Finally, although some archaeal membranes can be
    formed of bilayers like those found in bacteria and eukaryotes, other archaeal plasma membranes are lipid
    monolayers.

    Proteins on the cell's surface are important for a variety of functions, including cell-to-cell communication, and
    sensing environmental conditions and pathogenic virulence factors. Membrane proteins and phospholipids may
    have carbohydrates (sugars) associated with them and are called glycoproteins or glycolipids, respectively. These
    glycoprotein and glycolipid complexes extend out from the surface of the cell, allowing the cell to interact with the
    external environment (Figure 3.21). Glycoproteins and glycolipids in the plasma membrane can vary considerably in
    chemical composition among archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, allowing scientists to use them to characterize
    unique species.

    Plasma membranes from different cells types also contain unique phospholipids, which contain fatty acids. As
    described in Using Biochemistry to Identify Microorganisms, phospholipid-derived fatty acid analysis (PLFA) profiles
    can be used to identify unique types of cells based on differences in fatty acids. Archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes
    each have a unique PFLA profile.

    Membrane Transport Mechanisms
    One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is to control the transport of molecules into and out
    of the cell. Internal conditions must be maintained within a certain range despite any changes in the external
    environment. The transport of substances across the plasma membrane allows cells to do so.

    Cells use various modes of transport across the plasma membrane. For example, molecules moving from a higher
    concentration to a lower concentration with the concentration gradient are transported by simple diffusion, also
    known as passive transport (Figure 3.22). Some small molecules, like carbon dioxide, may cross the membrane
    bilayer directly by simple diffusion. However, charged molecules, as well as large molecules, need the help of
    carriers or channels in the membrane. These structures ferry molecules across the membrane, a process known as
    facilitated diffusion (Figure 3.23).

    Active transport occurs when cells move molecules across their membrane against concentration gradients (Figure
    3.24). A major difference between passive and active transport is that active transport requires adenosine
    triphosphate (ATP) or other forms of energy to move molecules "uphill." Therefore, active transport structures are
    often called "pumps."

Group translocation also transports substances into bacterial cells. In this case, as a molecule moves into a cell
against its concentration gradient, it is chemically modified so that it does not require transport against an
unfavorable concentration gradient. A common example of this is the bacterial phosphotransferase system, a series
of carriers that phosphorylates (i.e., adds phosphate ions to) glucose or other sugars upon entry into cells. Since the
phosphorylation of sugars is required during the early stages of sugar metabolism, the phosphotransferase system
is considered to be an energy neutral system.
Photosynthetic Membrane Structures
Some prokaryotic cells, namely cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria, have membrane structures that enable
them to perform photosynthesis. These structures consist of an infolding of the plasma membrane that encloses
photosynthetic pigments such as green chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls. In cyanobacteria, these membrane
structures are called thylakoids; in photosynthetic bacteria, they are called chromatophores, lamellae, or
chlorosomes.

Cell Wall

The primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from harsh conditions in the outside environment. When
present, there are notable similarities and differences among the cell walls of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.
The major component of bacterial cell walls is called peptidoglycan (or murein); it is only found in bacteria.
Structurally, peptidoglycan resembles a layer of meshwork or fabric (Figure 3.25). Each layer is composed of long
chains of alternating molecules of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). The structure of
the long chains has significant two-dimensional tensile strength due to the formation of peptide bridges that
96  3 · The Cell

    connect NAG and NAM within each peptidoglycan layer. In gram-negative bacteria, tetrapeptide chains extending
    from each NAM unit are directly cross-linked, whereas in gram-positive bacteria, these tetrapeptide chains are
    linked by pentaglycine cross-bridges. Peptidoglycan subunits are made inside of the bacterial cell and then exported
    and assembled in layers, giving the cell its shape.

    Since peptidoglycan is unique to bacteria, many antibiotic drugs are designed to interfere with peptidoglycan
    synthesis, weakening the cell wall and making bacterial cells more susceptible to the effects of osmotic pressure
    (see Mechanisms of Antibacterial Drugs). In addition, certain cells of the human immune system are able
    "recognize" bacterial pathogens by detecting peptidoglycan on the surface of a bacterial cell; these cells then engulf
    and destroy the bacterial cell, using enzymes such as lysozyme, which breaks down and digests the peptidoglycan in
    their cell walls (see Pathogen Recognition and Phagocytosis).

    FIGURE 3.25 Peptidoglycan is composed of polymers of alternating NAM and NAG subunits, which are cross-linked by peptide bridges
    linking NAM subunits from various glycan chains. This provides the cell wall with tensile strength in two dimensions.

    The Gram staining protocol (see Staining Microscopic Specimens) is used to differentiate two common types of cell
    wall structures (Figure 3.26). Gram-positive cells have a cell wall consisting of many layers of peptidoglycan totaling
    30-100 nm in thickness. These peptidoglycan layers are commonly embedded with teichoic acids (TAs),
    carbohydrate chains that extend through and beyond the peptidoglycan layer.19 TA is thought to stabilize
    peptidoglycan by increasing its rigidity. TA also plays a role in the ability of pathogenic gram-positive bacteria such
    as Streptococcus to bind to certain proteins on the surface of host cells, enhancing their ability to cause infection. In
    addition to peptidoglycan and TAs, bacteria of the family Mycobacteriaceae have an external layer of waxy mycolic
    acids in their cell wall; as described in Staining Microscopic Specimens, these bacteria are referred to as acid-fast,
    since acid-fast stains must be used to penetrate the mycolic acid layer for purposes of microscopy (Figure 3.27).

Gram-negative cells have a much thinner layer of peptidoglycan (no more than about 4 nm thick21 ) than gram-
positive cells, and the overall structure of their cell envelope is more complex. In gram-negative cells, a gel-like
matrix occupies the periplasmic space between the cell wall and the plasma membrane, and there is a second lipid
bilayer called the outer membrane, which is external to the peptidoglycan layer (Figure 3.26). This outer membrane
is attached to the peptidoglycan by murein lipoprotein. The outer leaflet of the outer membrane contains the
molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which functions as an endotoxin in infections involving gram-negative bacteria,
contributing to symptoms such as fever, hemorrhaging, and septic shock. Each LPS molecule is composed of Lipid A,
a core polysaccharide, and an O side chain that is composed of sugar-like molecules that comprise the external face
of the LPS (Figure 3.28). The composition of the O side chain varies between different species and strains of
bacteria. Parts of the O side chain called antigens can be detected using serological or immunological tests to
identify specific pathogenic strains like Escherichia coli O157:H7, a deadly strain of bacteria that causes bloody
diarrhea and kidney failure.

    embedded in the outer membrane, a core polysaccharide, and the O side chain.

    Archaeal cell wall structure differs from that of bacteria in several significant ways. First, archaeal cell walls do not
    contain peptidoglycan; instead, they contain a similar polymer called pseudopeptidoglycan (pseudomurein) in which
    NAM is replaced with a different subunit. Other archaea may have a layer of glycoproteins or polysaccharides that
    serves as the cell wall instead of pseudopeptidoglycan. Last, as is the case with some bacterial species, there are a
    few archaea that appear to lack cell walls entirely.

    Glycocalyces and S-Layers

    Although most prokaryotic cells have cell walls, some may have additional cell envelope structures exterior to the
    cell wall, such as glycocalyces and S-layers. A glycocalyx is a sugar coat, of which there are two important types:
    capsules and slime layers. A capsule is an organized layer located outside of the cell wall and usually composed of
    polysaccharides or proteins (Figure 3.29). A slime layer is a less tightly organized layer that is only loosely attached
    to the cell wall and can be more easily washed off. Slime layers may be composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins,
    or glycolipids.
    Glycocalyces allows cells to adhere to surfaces, aiding in the formation of biofilms (colonies of microbes that form in
    layers on surfaces). In nature, most microbes live in mixed communities within biofilms, partly because the biofilm
    affords them some level of protection. Biofilms generally hold water like a sponge, preventing desiccation. They also
    protect cells from predation and hinder the action of antibiotics and disinfectants. All of these properties are
    advantageous to the microbes living in a biofilm, but they present challenges in a clinical setting, where the goal is
    often to eliminate microbes.

aeruginosa, a bacterial pathogen capable of causing many different types of infections in humans. (credit b: modification of work by

The ability to produce a capsule can contribute to a microbe's pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) because the
capsule can make it more difficult for phagocytic cells (such as white blood cells) to engulf and kill the
microorganism. Streptococcus pneumoniae, for example, produces a capsule that is well known to aid in this
bacterium's pathogenicity. As explained in Staining Microscopic specimens, capsules are difficult to stain for
microscopy; negative staining techniques are typically used.

An S-layer is another type of cell envelope structure; it is composed of a mixture of structural proteins and
glycoproteins. In bacteria, S-layers are found outside the cell wall, but in some archaea, the S-layer serves as the
cell wall. The exact function of S-layers is not entirely understood, and they are difficult to study; but available
evidence suggests that they may play a variety of functions in different prokaryotic cells, such as helping the cell
withstand osmotic pressure and, for certain pathogens, interacting with the host immune system.

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Part 3

  After diagnosing Barbara with pneumonia, the PA writes her a prescription for amoxicillin, a commonly-
  prescribed type of penicillin derivative. More than a week later, despite taking the full course as directed,
  Barbara still feels weak and is not fully recovered, although she is still able to get through her daily activities.
  She returns to the health center for a follow-up visit.

  Many types of bacteria, fungi, and viruses can cause pneumonia. Amoxicillin targets the peptidoglycan of
  bacterial cell walls. Since the amoxicillin has not resolved Barbara's symptoms, the PA concludes that the
  causative agent probably lacks peptidoglycan, meaning that the pathogen could be a virus, a fungus, or a
  bacterium that lacks peptidoglycan. Another possibility is that the pathogen is a bacterium containing
  peptidoglycan but has developed resistance to amoxicillin.

      · How can the PA definitively identify the cause of Barbara's pneumonia?
      · What form of treatment should the PA prescribe, given that the amoxicillin was ineffective?

Filamentous Appendages

Many bacterial cells have protein appendages embedded within their cell envelopes that extend outward, allowing
interaction with the environment. These appendages can attach to other surfaces, transfer DNA, or provide
movement. Filamentous appendages include fimbriae, pili, and flagella.
100  3 · The Cell

     Fimbriae and Pili
     Fimbriae and pili are structurally similar and, because differentiation between the two is problematic, these terms
     are often used interchangeably.22 23 The term fimbriae commonly refers to short bristle-like proteins projecting
     from the cell surface by the hundreds. Fimbriae enable a cell to attach to surfaces and to other cells. For pathogenic
     bacteria, adherence to host cells is important for colonization, infectivity, and virulence. Adherence to surfaces is
     also important in biofilm formation.

     The term pili (singular: pilus) commonly refers to longer, less numerous protein appendages that aid in attachment
     to surfaces (Figure 3.30). A specific type of pilus, called the F pilus or sex pilus, is important in the transfer of DNA
     between bacterial cells, which occurs between members of the same generation when two cells physically transfer
     or exchange parts of their respective genomes (see How Asexual Prokaryotes Achieve Genetic Diversity).

     FIGURE 3.30 Bacteria may produce two different types of protein appendages that aid in surface attachment. Fimbriae typically are more
     numerous and shorter, whereas pili (shown here) are longer and less numerous per cell. (credit: modification of work by American Society
     for Microbiology)

             MICRO CONNECTIONS

     Group A Strep

     Before the structure and function of the various components of the bacterial cell envelope were well understood,
     scientists were already using cell envelope characteristics to classify bacteria. In 1933, Rebecca Lancefield
     proposed a method for serotyping various -hemolytic strains of Streptococcus species using an agglutination
     assay, a technique using the clumping of bacteria to detect specific cell-surface antigens. In doing so, Lancefield
     discovered that one group of S. pyogenes, found in Group A, was associated with a variety of human diseases. She
     determined that various strains of Group A strep could be distinguished from each other based on variations in
     specific cell surface proteins that she named M proteins.

     Today, more than 80 different strains of Group A strep have been identified based on M proteins. Various strains of
     Group A strep are associated with a wide variety of human infections, including streptococcal pharyngitis (strep
     throat), impetigo, toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and necrotizing fasciitis. The M protein is an
     important virulence factor for Group A strep, helping these strains evade the immune system. Changes in M proteins
     appear to alter the infectivity of a particular strain of Group A strep.

     Flagella
     Flagella are structures used by cells to move in aqueous environments. Bacterial flagella act like propellers. They
     are stiff spiral filaments composed of flagellin protein subunits that extend outward from the cell and spin in
     solution. The basal body is the motor for the flagellum and is embedded in the plasma membrane (Figure 3.31). A
     hook region connects the basal body to the filament. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have different basal
     body configurations due to differences in cell wall structure.

     Different types of motile bacteria exhibit different arrangements of flagella (Figure 3.32). A bacterium with a singular
     flagellum, typically located at one end of the cell (polar), is said to have a monotrichous flagellum. An example of a

monotrichously flagellated bacterial pathogen is Vibrio cholerae, the gram-negative bacterium that causes cholera.
Cells with amphitrichous flagella have a flagellum or tufts of flagella at each end. An example is Spirillum minor, the
cause of spirillary (Asian) rat-bite fever or sodoku. Cells with lophotrichous flagella have a tuft at one end of the cell.
The gram-negative bacillus Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen known for causing many
infections, including "swimmer's ear" and burn wound infections, has lophotrichous flagella. Flagella that cover the
entire surface of a bacterial cell are called peritrichous flagella. The gram-negative bacterium E. coli shows a
peritrichous arrangement of flagella.

arrangement differ between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. (credit: modification of work by "LadyofHats"/Mariana Ruiz
Villareal)

FIGURE 3.32 Flagellated bacteria may exhibit multiple arrangements of their flagella. Common arrangements include monotrichous,
amphitrichous, lophotrichous, or peritrichous.

Directional movement depends on the configuration of the flagella. Bacteria can move in response to a variety of
environmental signals, including light (phototaxis), magnetic fields (magnetotaxis) using magnetosomes, and, most
commonly, chemical gradients (chemotaxis). Purposeful movement toward a chemical attractant, like a food
source, or away from a repellent, like a poisonous chemical, is achieved by increasing the length of runs and
decreasing the length of tumbles. When running, flagella rotate in a counterclockwise direction, allowing the
bacterial cell to move forward. In a peritrichous bacterium, the flagella are all bundled together in a very
streamlined way (Figure 3.33), allowing for efficient movement. When tumbling, flagella are splayed out while
rotating in a clockwise direction, creating a looping motion and preventing meaningful forward movement but
reorienting the cell toward the direction of the attractant. When an attractant exists, runs and tumbles still occur;
however, the length of runs is longer, while the length of the tumbles is reduced, allowing overall movement toward
the higher concentration of the attractant. When no chemical gradient exists, the lengths of runs and tumbles are
more equal, and overall movement is more random (Figure 3.34).
102  3 · The Cell

     FIGURE 3.33 Bacteria achieve directional movement by changing the rotation of their flagella. In a cell with peritrichous flagella, the
     flagella bundle when they rotate in a counterclockwise direction, resulting in a run. However, when the flagella rotate in a clockwise
     direction, the flagella are no longer bundled, resulting in tumbles.

     FIGURE 3.34 Without a chemical gradient, flagellar rotation cycles between counterclockwise (run) and clockwise (tumble) with no overall
     directional movement. However, when a chemical gradient of an attractant exists, the length of runs is extended, while the length of
     tumbles is decreased. This leads to chemotaxis: an overall directional movement toward the higher concentration of the attractant.

3.4 Unique Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain the distinguishing characteristics of eukaryotic cells
    · Describe internal and external structures of eukaryotic cells in terms of their physical structure, chemical

        structure, and function
    · Identify and describe structures and organelles unique to eukaryotic cells
    · Compare and contrast similar structures found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
    · Describe the processes of eukaryotic mitosis and meiosis, and compare to prokaryotic binary fission

Eukaryotic organisms include protozoans, algae, fungi, plants, and animals. Some eukaryotic cells are independent,
single-celled microorganisms, whereas others are part of multicellular organisms. The cells of eukaryotic organisms
have several distinguishing characteristics. Above all, eukaryotic cells are defined by the presence of a nucleus
surrounded by a complex nuclear membrane. Also, eukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of
membrane-bound organelles in the cytoplasm. Organelles such as mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and peroxisomes are held in place by the cytoskeleton, an internal network that
supports transport of intracellular components and helps maintain cell shape (Figure 3.35). The genome of
eukaryotic cells is packaged in multiple, rod-shaped chromosomes as opposed to the single, circular-shaped
chromosome that characterizes most prokaryotic cells. Table 3.2 compares the characteristics of eukaryotic cell
structures with those of bacteria and archaea.

terms of structure and function, and a particular cell may not have all of the structures shown here.

Cell Morphologies

Eukaryotic cells display a wide variety of different cell morphologies. Possible shapes include spheroid, ovoid,
cuboidal, cylindrical, flat, lenticular, fusiform, discoidal, crescent, ring stellate, and polygonal (Figure 3.36). Some
eukaryotic cells are irregular in shape, and some are capable of changing shape. The shape of a particular type of
eukaryotic cell may be influenced by factors such as its primary function, the organization of its cytoskeleton, the
viscosity of its cytoplasm, the rigidity of its cell membrane or cell wall (if it has one), and the physical pressure
exerted on it by the surrounding environment and/or adjoining cells.

    · Identify two differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.

Nucleus

Unlike prokaryotic cells, in which DNA is loosely contained in the nucleoid region, eukaryotic cells possess a
nucleus, which is surrounded by a complex nuclear membrane that houses the DNA genome (Figure 3.37). By
containing the cell's DNA, the nucleus ultimately controls all activities of the cell and also serves an essential role in
reproduction and heredity. Eukaryotic cells typically have their DNA organized into multiple linear chromosomes.
The DNA within the nucleus is highly organized and condensed to fit inside the nucleus, which is accomplished by
wrapping the DNA around proteins called histones.
106  3 · The Cell

     FIGURE 3.37 Eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The nucleus of this mammalian lung cell is
     located in the bottom right corner of the image. The large, dark, oval-shaped structure within the nucleus is the nucleolus.

     Although most eukaryotic cells have only one nucleus, exceptions exist. For example, protozoans of the genus
     Paramecium typically have two complete nuclei: a small nucleus that is used for reproduction (micronucleus) and a
     large nucleus that directs cellular metabolism (macronucleus). Additionally, some fungi transiently form cells with
     two nuclei, called heterokaryotic cells, during sexual reproduction. Cells whose nuclei divide, but whose cytoplasm
     does not, are called coenocytes.

     The nucleus is bound by a complex nuclear membrane, often called the nuclear envelope, that consists of two
     distinct lipid bilayers that are contiguous with each other (Figure 3.38). Despite these connections between the
     inner and outer membranes, each membrane contains unique lipids and proteins on its inner and outer surfaces.
     The nuclear envelope contains nuclear pores, which are large, rosette-shaped protein complexes that control the
     movement of materials into and out of the nucleus. The overall shape of the nucleus is determined by the nuclear
     lamina, a meshwork of intermediate filaments found just inside the nuclear envelope membranes. Outside the
     nucleus, additional intermediate filaments form a looser mesh and serve to anchor the nucleus in position within the
     cell.

     FIGURE 3.38 In this fluorescent microscope image, all the intermediate filaments have been stained with a bright green fluorescent stain.
     The nuclear lamina is the intense bright green ring around the faint red nuclei.

     Eukaryotes are able to multiply through asexual reproduction, during which a single parent cell becomes two
     identical daughter cells. This process of clonal reproduction is called mitosis. Although mitosis may sound similar to
     asexual binary fission in prokaryotes, the processes are very different. In contrast to the single chromosome in most
     prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells possess multiple chromosomes that must be replicated and strategically divided
     between daughter cells. Therefore, mitosis is a much more complex cellular process than binary fission.

     The eukaryotic cell cycle is an ordered and carefully regulated series of events involving cell growth, DNA
     replication, and cell division to produce two clonal daughter cells. One "turn" or cycle of the cell cycle consist of two
     general phases: interphase and the mitotic phase. (Figure 3.39). During interphase, the cell is not dividing, but
     rather is undergoing normal growth processes and DNA is replicated preparing for cell division. The three stages of

interphase are called G1, S, and G2.

FIGURE 3.39 The cell cycle consists of interphase and the mitotic phase. During interphase, the cell grows and the nuclear DNA is
duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are segregated and
distributed into daughter nuclei. The cytoplasm is usually divided as well, resulting in two daughter cells. (attribution: Biology 2e, Rice
University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, move to
opposite poles of the cell, and then are divided into two identical daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic
phase is called karyokinesis, or nuclear division. Karyokinesis is divided into a series of phases--prophase,
prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase--that result in the division of the cell nucleus (Figure 3.40).
The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic
components into the two daughter cells.

     dyes: blue fluorescence indicates DNA (chromosomes) and green fluorescence indicates microtubules (spindle apparatus). (attribution:

     In addition to the mitotic asexual reproduction described above, most eukaryotic microorganisms also have the
     option of sexual reproduction involving meiosis. Although mitosis and meiosis both require DNA replication, nuclear
     division, and share procedural similarities, there are important differences between the process and outcomes
     (Figure 3.41).

FIGURE 3.41 Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one cycle of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two nuclear divisions. The
four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells resulting from mitosis are diploid and
identical to the parent cell. (credit: Biology 2e, Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

In contrast to the single nuclear division that completes mitosis, meiosis involves two separate nuclear divisions.
Rather than creating two clonal daughter cells, the goal of meiosis is to create four genetically-distinct gametes,
with each gamete possessing half the number of chromosomes found in the original cell. This strategic chromosome
reduction is essential for the fertilization that occurs during sexual reproduction to produce in a zygote with a full
complement of chromosomes.

Nucleolus
The nucleolus is a dense region within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biosynthesis occurs. In addition,
the nucleolus is also the site where assembly of ribosomes begins. Preribosomal complexes are assembled from
rRNA and proteins in the nucleolus; they are then transported out to the cytoplasm, where ribosome assembly is
completed (Figure 3.42).

     FIGURE 3.42 (a) The nucleolus is the dark, dense area within the nucleus. It is the site of rRNA synthesis and preribosomal assembly. (b)
     Electron micrograph showing the nucleolus.

     Ribosomes

     Ribosomes found in eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts have 70S ribosomes--the same size
     as prokaryotic ribosomes. However, nonorganelle-associated ribosomes in eukaryotic cells are 80S ribosomes,
     composed of a 40S small subunit and a 60S large subunit. In terms of size and composition, this makes them
     distinct from the ribosomes of prokaryotic cells.
     The two types of nonorganelle-associated eukaryotic ribosomes are defined by their location in the cell: free
     ribosomes and membrane-bound ribosomes. Free ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm and serve to synthesize
     water-soluble proteins; membrane-bound ribosomes are found attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and
     make proteins for insertion into the cell membrane or proteins destined for export from the cell.
     The differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes are clinically relevant because certain antibiotic
     drugs are designed to target one or the other. For example, cycloheximide targets eukaryotic action, whereas
     chloramphenicol targets prokaryotic ribosomes.24 Since human cells are eukaryotic, they generally are not harmed
     by antibiotics that destroy the prokaryotic ribosomes in bacteria. However, sometimes negative side effects may
     occur because mitochondria in human cells contain prokaryotic ribosomes.

     Endomembrane System

     The endomembrane system, unique to eukaryotic cells, is a series of membranous tubules, sacs, and flattened
     disks that synthesize many cell components and move materials around within the cell (Figure 3.43). Because of
     their larger cell size, eukaryotic cells require this system to transport materials that cannot be dispersed by diffusion
     alone. The endomembrane system comprises several organelles and connections between them, including the
     endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vesicles.

FIGURE 3.43 The endomembrane system is composed of a series of membranous intracellular structures that facilitate movement of
materials throughout the cell and to the cell membrane.

Endoplasmic Reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an interconnected array of tubules and cisternae (flattened sacs) with a single
lipid bilayer (Figure 3.44). The spaces inside of the cisternae are called lumen of the ER. There are two types of ER,
rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). These two different types of ER
are sites for the synthesis of distinctly different types of molecules. RER is studded with ribosomes bound on the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane. These ribosomes make proteins destined for the plasma membrane (Figure
3.44). Following synthesis, these proteins are inserted into the membrane of the RER. Small sacs of the RER
containing these newly synthesized proteins then bud off as transport vesicles and move either to the Golgi
apparatus for further processing, directly to the plasma membrane, to the membrane of another organelle, or out of
the cell. Transport vesicles are single-lipid, bilayer, membranous spheres with hollow interiors that carry molecules.
SER does not have ribosomes and, therefore, appears "smooth." It is involved in biosynthesis of lipids, carbohydrate
metabolism, and detoxification of toxic compounds within the cell.

FIGURE 3.44 The rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes for the synthesis of membrane proteins (which give it its rough
appearance).

Golgi Apparatus
The Golgi apparatus was discovered within the endomembrane system in 1898 by Italian scientist Camillo Golgi
(1843-1926), who developed a novel staining technique that showed stacked membrane structures within the cells
of Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. The Golgi apparatus is composed of a series of membranous disks
called dictyosomes, each having a single lipid bilayer, that are stacked together (Figure 3.45).
Enzymes in the Golgi apparatus modify lipids and proteins transported from the ER to the Golgi, often adding
carbohydrate components to them, producing glycolipids, glycoproteins, or proteoglycans. Glycolipids and
glycoproteins are often inserted into the plasma membrane and are important for signal recognition by other cells or
infectious particles. Different types of cells can be distinguished from one another by the structure and arrangement
of the glycolipids and glycoproteins contained in their plasma membranes. These glycolipids and glycoproteins
commonly also serve as cell surface receptors.
112  3 · The Cell

     Transport vesicles leaving the ER fuse with a Golgi apparatus on its receiving, or cis, face. The proteins are
     processed within the Golgi apparatus, and then additional transport vesicles containing the modified proteins and
     lipids pinch off from the Golgi apparatus on its outgoing, or trans, face. These outgoing vesicles move to and fuse
     with the plasma membrane or the membrane of other organelles.

     Exocytosis is the process by which secretory vesicles (spherical membranous sacs) release their contents to the
     cell's exterior (Figure 3.45). All cells have constitutive secretory pathways in which secretory vesicles transport
     soluble proteins that are released from the cell continually (constitutively). Certain specialized cells also have
     regulated secretory pathways, which are used to store soluble proteins in secretory vesicles. Regulated secretion
     involves substances that are only released in response to certain events or signals. For example, certain cells of the
     human immune system (e.g., mast cells) secrete histamine in response to the presence of foreign objects or
     pathogens in the body. Histamine is a compound that triggers various mechanisms used by the immune system to
     eliminate pathogens.

     FIGURE 3.45 A transmission electron micrograph (left) of a Golgi apparatus in a white blood cell. The illustration (right) shows the cup-
     shaped, stacked disks and several transport vesicles. The Golgi apparatus modifies lipids and proteins, producing glycolipids and
     glycoproteins, respectively, which are commonly inserted into the plasma membrane.

     Lysosomes
     In the 1960s, Belgian scientist Christian de Duve (1917-2013) discovered lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles
     of the endomembrane system that contain digestive enzymes. Certain types of eukaryotic cells use lysosomes to
     break down various particles, such as food, damaged organelles or cellular debris, microorganisms, or immune
     complexes. Compartmentalization of the digestive enzymes within the lysosome allows the cell to efficiently digest
     matter without harming the cytoplasmic components of the cell.

         · Name the components of the endomembrane system and describe the function of each component.

     Peroxisomes

     Christian de Duve is also credited with the discovery of peroxisomes, membrane-bound organelles that are not part
     of the endomembrane system (Figure 3.46). Peroxisomes form independently in the cytoplasm from the synthesis
     of peroxin proteins by free ribosomes and the incorporation of these peroxin proteins into existing peroxisomes.
     Growing peroxisomes then divide by a process similar to binary fission.

     Peroxisomes were first named for their ability to produce hydrogen peroxide, a highly reactive molecule that helps
     to break down molecules such as uric acid, amino acids, and fatty acids. Peroxisomes also possess the enzyme
     catalase, which can degrade hydrogen peroxide. Along with the SER, peroxisomes also play a role in lipid
     biosynthesis. Like lysosomes, the compartmentalization of these degradative molecules within an organelle helps
     protect the cytoplasmic contents from unwanted damage.

The peroxisomes of certain organisms are specialized to meet their particular functional needs. For example,
glyoxysomes are modified peroxisomes of yeasts and plant cells that perform several metabolic functions, including
the production of sugar molecules. Similarly, glycosomes are modified peroxisomes made by certain trypanosomes,
the pathogenic protozoans that cause Chagas disease and African sleeping sickness.

FIGURE 3.46 A transmission electron micrograph (left) of a cell containing a peroxisome. The illustration (right) shows the location of
peroxisomes in a cell. These eukaryotic structures play a role in lipid biosynthesis and breaking down various molecules. They may also

Cytoskeleton

Eukaryotic cells have an internal cytoskeleton made of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.
This matrix of fibers and tubes provides structural support as well as a network over which materials can be
transported within the cell and on which organelles can be anchored (Figure 3.47). For example, the process of
exocytosis involves the movement of a vesicle via the cytoskeletal network to the plasma membrane, where it can
release its contents.

FIGURE 3.47 The cytoskeleton is a network of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules found throughout the cytoplasm
of a eukaryotic cell. In these fluorescently labeled animal cells, the microtubules are green, the actin microfilaments are red, the nucleus is
blue, and keratin (a type of intermediate filament) is yellow.
114  3 · The Cell

     Microfilaments are composed of two intertwined strands of actin, each composed of actin monomers forming
     filamentous cables 6 nm in diameter25 (Figure 3.48). The actin filaments work together with motor proteins, like
     myosin, to effect muscle contraction in animals or the amoeboid movement of some eukaryotic microbes. In
     ameboid organisms, actin can be found in two forms: a stiffer, polymerized, gel form and a more fluid,
     unpolymerized soluble form. Actin in the gel form creates stability in the ectoplasm, the gel-like area of cytoplasm
     just inside the plasma membrane of ameboid protozoans.

     Temporary extensions of the cytoplasmic membrane called pseudopodia (meaning "false feet") are produced
     through the forward flow of soluble actin filaments into the pseudopodia, followed by the gel-sol cycling of the actin
     filaments, resulting in cell motility. Once the cytoplasm extends outward, forming a pseudopodium, the remaining
     cytoplasm flows up to join the leading edge, thereby creating forward locomotion. Beyond amoeboid movement,
     microfilaments are also involved in a variety of other processes in eukaryotic cells, including cytoplasmic streaming
     (the movement or circulation of cytoplasm within the cell), cleavage furrow formation during cell division, and
     muscle movement in animals (Figure 3.48). These functions are the result of the dynamic nature of microfilaments,
     which can polymerize and depolymerize relatively easily in response to cellular signals, and their interactions with
     molecular motors in different types of eukaryotic cells.

     FIGURE 3.48 (a) A microfilament is composed of a pair of actin filaments. (b) Each actin filament is a string of polymerized actin monomers.
     (c) The dynamic nature of actin, due to its polymerization and depolymerization and its association with myosin, allows microfilaments to
     be involved in a variety of cellular processes, including ameboid movement, cytoplasmic streaming, contractile ring formation during cell

Intermediate filaments (Figure 3.49) are a diverse group of cytoskeletal filaments that act as cables within the cell.
They are termed "intermediate" because their 10-nm diameter is thicker than that of actin but thinner than that of
microtubules.26 They are composed of several strands of polymerized subunits that, in turn, are made up of a wide
variety of monomers. Intermediate filaments tend to be more permanent in the cell and maintain the position of the
nucleus. They also form the nuclear lamina (lining or layer) just inside the nuclear envelope. Additionally,
intermediate filaments play a role in anchoring cells together in animal tissues. The intermediate filament protein
desmin is found in desmosomes, the protein structures that join muscle cells together and help them resist external
physical forces. The intermediate filament protein keratin is a structural protein found in hair, skin, and nails.

FIGURE 3.49 (a) Intermediate filaments are composed of multiple strands of polymerized subunits. They are more permanent than other
cytoskeletal structures and serve a variety of functions. (b) Intermediate filaments form much of the nuclear lamina. (c) Intermediate
filaments form the desmosomes between cells in some animal tissues. (credit c "illustration": modification of work by Mariana Ruiz

Microtubules (Figure 3.50) are a third type of cytoskeletal fiber composed of tubulin dimers ( tubulin and 
tubulin). These form hollow tubes 23 nm in diameter that are used as girders within the cytoskeleton.27 Like
microfilaments, microtubules are dynamic and have the ability to rapidly assemble and disassemble. Microtubules
also work with motor proteins (such as dynein and kinesin) to move organelles and vesicles around within the
cytoplasm. Additionally, microtubules are the main components of eukaryotic flagella and cilia, composing both the
filament and the basal body components (Figure 3.57).

FIGURE 3.50 (a) Microtubules are hollow structures composed of polymerized tubulin dimers. (b) They are involved in several cellular
processes, including the movement of organelles throughout the cytoplasm. Motor proteins carry organelles along microtubule tracks that

     Mitochondria

     The large, complex organelles in which aerobic cellular respiration occurs in eukaryotic cells are called
     mitochondria (Figure 3.52). The term "mitochondrion" was first coined by German microbiologist Carl Benda in
     1898 and was later connected with the process of respiration by Otto Warburg in 1913. Scientists during the 1960s
     discovered that mitochondria have their own genome and 70S ribosomes. The mitochondrial genome was found to
     be bacterial, when it was sequenced in 1976. These findings ultimately supported the endosymbiotic theory
     proposed by Lynn Margulis, which states that mitochondria originally arose through an endosymbiotic event in which
     a bacterium capable of aerobic cellular respiration was taken up by phagocytosis into a host cell and remained as a
     viable intracellular component.
     Each mitochondrion has two lipid membranes. The outer membrane is a remnant of the original host cell's
     membrane structures. The inner membrane was derived from the bacterial plasma membrane. The electron
     transport chain for aerobic respiration uses integral proteins embedded in the inner membrane. The mitochondrial
     matrix, corresponding to the location of the original bacterium's cytoplasm, is the current location of many
     metabolic enzymes. It also contains mitochondrial DNA and 70S ribosomes. Invaginations of the inner membrane,
     called cristae, evolved to increase surface area for the location of biochemical reactions. The folding patterns of the
     cristae differ among various types of eukaryotic cells and are used to distinguish different eukaryotic organisms
     from each other.

Chloroplasts

Plant cells and algal cells contain chloroplasts, the organelles in which photosynthesis occurs (Figure 3.53). All
chloroplasts have at least three membrane systems: the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid
membrane system. Inside the outer and inner membranes is the chloroplast stroma, a gel-like fluid that makes up
much of a chloroplast's volume, and in which the thylakoid system floats. The thylakoid system is a highly dynamic
collection of folded membrane sacs. It is where the green photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll is found and the light
reactions of photosynthesis occur. In most plant chloroplasts, the thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana
(singular: granum), whereas in some algal chloroplasts, the thylakoids are free floating.

FIGURE 3.53 Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which have an outer membrane and an inner membrane. Stacks of thylakoids
called grana form a third membrane layer.

Other organelles similar to mitochondria have arisen in other types of eukaryotes, but their roles differ.
Hydrogenosomes are found in some anaerobic eukaryotes and serve as the location of anaerobic hydrogen
production. Hydrogenosomes typically lack their own DNA and ribosomes. Kinetoplasts are a variation of the
mitochondria found in some eukaryotic pathogens. In these organisms, each cell has a single, long, branched
mitochondrion in which kinetoplast DNA, organized as multiple circular pieces of DNA, is found concentrated at one
pole of the cell.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Mitochondria-Related Organelles in Protozoan Parasites

Many protozoans, including several protozoan parasites that cause infections in humans, can be identified by their
unusual appearance. Distinguishing features may include complex cell morphologies, the presence of unique
organelles, or the absence of common organelles. The protozoan parasites Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas
vaginalis are two examples.

G. lamblia, a frequent cause of diarrhea in humans and many other animals, is an anaerobic parasite that possesses
two nuclei and several flagella. Its Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum are greatly reduced, and it lacks
mitochondria completely. However, it does have organelles known as mitosomes, double-membrane-bound
organelles that appear to be severely reduced mitochondria. This has led scientists to believe that G. lamblia's
ancestors once possessed mitochondria that evolved to become mitosomes. T. vaginalis, which causes the sexually

possesses hydrogenosomes, mitochondrial-related, double-membrane-bound organelles that produce molecular
hydrogen used in cellular metabolism. Scientists believe that hydrogenosomes, like mitosomes, also evolved from
mitochondria.28

     Plasma Membrane

     The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is similar in structure to the prokaryotic plasma membrane in that it is
     composed mainly of phospholipids forming a bilayer with embedded peripheral and integral proteins (Figure 3.54).
     These membrane components move within the plane of the membrane according to the fluid mosaic model.
     However, unlike the prokaryotic membrane, eukaryotic membranes contain sterols, including cholesterol, that alter
     membrane fluidity. Additionally, many eukaryotic cells contain some specialized lipids, including sphingolipids,
     which are thought to play a role in maintaining membrane stability as well as being involved in signal transduction
     pathways and cell-to-cell communication.

     FIGURE 3.54 The eukaryotic plasma membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer with many embedded or associated proteins. It contains
     cholesterol for the maintenance of membrane, as well as glycoproteins and glycolipids that are important in the recognition other cells or
     pathogens.

     Membrane Transport Mechanisms
     The processes of simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport are used in both eukaryotic and
     prokaryotic cells. However, eukaryotic cells also have the unique ability to perform various types of endocytosis, the
     uptake of matter through plasma membrane invagination and vacuole/vesicle formation (Figure 3.55). A type of
     endocytosis involving the engulfment of large particles through membrane invagination is called phagocytosis,
     which means "cell eating." In phagocytosis, particles (or other cells) are enclosed in a pocket within the membrane,
     which then pinches off from the membrane to form a vacuole that completely surrounds the particle. Another type
     of endocytosis is called pinocytosis, which means "cell drinking." In pinocytosis, small, dissolved materials and
     liquids are taken into the cell through small vesicles. Saprophytic fungi, for example, obtain their nutrients from
     dead and decaying matter largely through pinocytosis.
     Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a type of endocytosis that is initiated by specific molecules called ligands when
     they bind to cell surface receptors on the membrane. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the mechanism that
     peptide and amine-derived hormones use to enter cells and is also used by various viruses and bacteria for entry
     into host cells.

FIGURE 3.55 Three variations of endocytosis are shown. (a) In phagocytosis, the cell membrane surrounds the particle and pinches off to

In receptor-mediated endocytosis, the uptake of substances is targeted to a specific substance (a ligand) that binds at the receptor on the
external cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villarreal)

The process by which secretory vesicles release their contents to the cell's exterior is called exocytosis. Vesicles
move toward the plasma membrane and then meld with the membrane, ejecting their contents out of the cell.
Exocytosis is used by cells to remove waste products and may also be used to release chemical signals that can be
taken up by other cells.

Cell Wall

In addition to a plasma membrane, some eukaryotic cells have a cell wall. Cells of fungi, algae, plants, and even
some protists have cell walls. Depending upon the type of eukaryotic cell, cell walls can be made of a wide range of
materials, including cellulose (fungi and plants); biogenic silica, calcium carbonate, agar, and carrageenan (protists
and algae); or chitin (fungi). In general, all cell walls provide structural stability for the cell and protection from
environmental stresses such as desiccation, changes in osmotic pressure, and traumatic injury.29

Extracellular Matrix

Cells of animals and some protozoans do not have cell walls to help maintain shape and provide structural stability.
Instead, these types of eukaryotic cells produce an extracellular matrix for this purpose. They secrete a sticky
mass of carbohydrates and proteins into the spaces between adjacent cells (Figure 3.56). Some protein
components assemble into a basement membrane to which the remaining extracellular matrix components adhere.
Proteoglycans typically form the bulky mass of the extracellular matrix while fibrous proteins, like collagen, provide
strength. Both proteoglycans and collagen are attached to fibronectin proteins, which, in turn, are attached to
integrin proteins. These integrin proteins interact with transmembrane proteins in the plasma membranes of
eukaryotic cells that lack cell walls.

In animal cells, the extracellular matrix allows cells within tissues to withstand external stresses and transmits
signals from the outside of the cell to the inside. The amount of extracellular matrix is quite extensive in various
types of connective tissues, and variations in the extracellular matrix can give different types of tissues their distinct
properties. In addition, a host cell's extracellular matrix is often the site where microbial pathogens attach
themselves to establish infection. For example, Streptococcus pyogenes, the bacterium that causes strep throat and
various other infections, binds to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix of the cells lining the oropharynx (upper
region of the throat).

     transmits signals arriving at the outside edges of the tissue to cells deeper within the tissue.

     Flagella and Cilia

     Some eukaryotic cells use flagella for locomotion; however, eukaryotic flagella are structurally distinct from those
     found in prokaryotic cells. Whereas the prokaryotic flagellum is a stiff, rotating structure, a eukaryotic flagellum is
     more like a flexible whip composed of nine parallel pairs of microtubules surrounding a central pair of microtubules.
     This arrangement is referred to as a 9+2 array (Figure 3.57). The parallel microtubules use dynein motor proteins to
     move relative to each other, causing the flagellum to bend.
     Cilia (singular: cilium) are a similar external structure found in some eukaryotic cells. Unique to eukaryotes, cilia are
     shorter than flagella and often cover the entire surface of a cell; however, they are structurally similar to flagella (a
     9+2 array of microtubules) and use the same mechanism for movement. A structure called a basal body is found at
     the base of each cilium and flagellum. The basal body, which attaches the cilium or flagellum to the cell, is
     composed of an array of triplet microtubules similar to that of a centriole but embedded in the plasma membrane.
     Because of their shorter length, cilia use a rapid, flexible, waving motion. In addition to motility, cilia may have other
     functions such as sweeping particles past or into cells. For example, ciliated protozoans use the sweeping of cilia to
     move food particles into their mouthparts, and ciliated cells in the mammalian respiratory tract beat in synchrony to
     sweep mucus and debris up and out of the lungs (Figure 3.57).

INTRODUCTION Scientists have studied prokaryotes for centuries, but it wasn't until 1966 that scientist Thomas
Brock (1926-2021) discovered that certain bacteria can live in boiling water. This led many to wonder whether
prokaryotes may also live in other extreme environments, such as at the bottom of the ocean, at high altitudes, or
inside volcanoes, or even on other planets.
Prokaryotes have an important role in changing, shaping, and sustaining the entire biosphere. They can produce
proteins and other substances used by molecular biologists in basic research and in medicine and industry. For
example, the bacterium Shewanella lives in the deep sea, where oxygen is scarce. It grows long appendages, which
have special sensors used to seek the limited oxygen in its environment. It can also digest toxic waste and generate
electricity. Other species of prokaryotes can produce more oxygen than the entire Amazon rainforest, while still
others supply plants, animals, and humans with usable forms of nitrogen; and inhabit our body, protecting us from
harmful microorganisms and producing some vitally important substances. This chapter will examine the diversity,
structure, and function of prokaryotes.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Marsha, a 20-year-old university student, recently returned to the United States from a trip to Nigeria, where she
       had interned as a medical assistant for an organization working to improve access to laboratory services for
       tuberculosis testing. When she returned, Marsha began to feel fatigue, which she initially attributed to jet lag.
       However, the fatigue persisted, and Marsha soon began to experience other bothersome symptoms, such as
       occasional coughing, night sweats, loss of appetite, and a low-grade fever of 37.4 °C (99.3 °F).

       Marsha expected her symptoms would subside in a few days, but instead, they gradually became more severe.
       About two weeks after returning home, she coughed up some sputum and noticed that it contained blood and
       small whitish clumps resembling cottage cheese. Her fever spiked to 38.2 °C (100.8 °F), and she began feeling
       sharp pains in her chest when breathing deeply. Concerned that she seemed to be getting worse, Marsha
       scheduled an appointment with her physician.

           · Could Marsha's symptoms be related to her overseas travel, even several weeks after returning home?

       Jump to the next Clinical Focus box.

     All living organisms are classified into three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. In this chapter, we will
     focus on the domains Archaea and Bacteria. Archaea and bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic organisms. Unlike
     eukaryotes, they have no nuclei or any other membrane-bound organelles.

     Prokaryote Habitats and Functions

     Prokaryotes are ubiquitous. They can be found everywhere on our planet, even in hot springs, in the Antarctic ice
     shield, and under extreme pressure two miles under water. One bacterium, Paracoccus denitrificans, has even been
     shown to survive when scientists removed it from its native environment (soil) and centrifuged it to 2.4 g, equivalent
     to the gravitational force on the surface of Jupiter.

     Prokaryotes also are abundant on and within the human body. It has been estimated that prokaryotes, especially
     bacteria, outnumber nucleated human cells 10:1.1 More recent studies suggest the ratio could be closer to 1:1, but
     even that ratio means that there are a great number of bacteria within the human body.2 Bacteria thrive in the
     human mouth, nasal cavity, throat, ears, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. Large colonies of bacteria can be found
     on healthy human skin, especially in moist areas (armpits, navel, and areas behind ears). However, even drier areas
     of the skin are not free from bacteria.

     The existence of prokaryotes is very important for the stability and thriving of ecosystems. For example, they are a
     necessary part of soil formation and stabilization processes through the breakdown of organic matter and
     development of biofilms. One gram of soil contains up to 10 billion microorganisms (most of them prokaryotic)
     belonging to about 1,000 species. Many species of bacteria use substances released from plant roots, such as acids
     and carbohydrates, as nutrients. The bacteria metabolize these plant substances and release the products of
     bacterial metabolism back to the soil, forming humus and thus increasing the soil's fertility. In salty lakes such as
     the Dead Sea (Figure 4.2), salt-loving halobacteria decompose dead brine shrimp and nourish young brine shrimp
     and flies with the products of bacterial metabolism.

In addition to living in the ground and the water, prokaryotic microorganisms are abundant in the air, even high in the
atmosphere. There may be up to 2,000 different kinds of bacteria in the air, similar to their diversity in the soil.

Prokaryotes can be found everywhere on earth because they are extremely resilient and adaptable. They are often
metabolically flexible, which means that they might easily switch from one energy source to another, depending on
the availability of the sources, or from one metabolic pathway to another. For example, certain prokaryotic
cyanobacteria can switch from a conventional type of lipid metabolism, which includes production of fatty
aldehydes, to a different type of lipid metabolism that generates biofuel, such as fatty acids and wax esters.
Groundwater bacteria store complex high-energy carbohydrates when grown in pure groundwater, but they
metabolize these molecules when the groundwater is enriched with phosphates. Some bacteria get their energy by
reducing sulfates into sulfides, but can switch to a different metabolic pathway when necessary, producing acids
and free hydrogen ions.

Prokaryotes perform functions vital to life on earth by capturing (or "fixing") and recycling elements like carbon and
nitrogen. Organisms such as animals require organic carbon to grow, but, unlike prokaryotes, they are unable to use
inorganic carbon sources like carbon dioxide. Thus, animals rely on prokaryotes to convert carbon dioxide into
organic carbon products that they can use. This process of converting carbon dioxide to organic carbon products is
called carbon fixation.

Plants and animals also rely heavily on prokaryotes for nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into
ammonia, a compound that some plants can use to form many different biomolecules necessary to their survival.
Bacteria in the genus Rhizobium, for example, are nitrogen-fixing bacteria; they live in the roots of legume plants
such as clover, alfalfa, and peas (Figure 4.3). Ammonia produced by Rhizobium helps these plants to survive by
enabling them to make building blocks of nucleic acids. In turn, these plants may be eaten by animals--sustaining
their growth and survival--or they may die, in which case the products of nitrogen fixation will enrich the soil and be
used by other plants.

     root nodule shows bacteroids (bacterium-like cells or modified bacterial cells) within the plant cells. The bacteroids are visible as darker
     ovals within the larger plant cell. (credit a: modification of work by USDA)

     Another positive function of prokaryotes is in cleaning up the environment. Recently, some researchers focused on
     the diversity and functions of prokaryotes in manmade environments. They found that some bacteria play a unique
     role in degrading toxic chemicals that pollute water and soil.3

     Despite all of the positive and helpful roles prokaryotes play, some are human pathogens that may cause illness or
     infection when they enter the body. In addition, some bacteria can contaminate food, causing spoilage or foodborne
     illness, which makes them subjects of concern in food preparation and safety. Less than 1% of prokaryotes (all of
     them bacteria) are thought to be human pathogens, but collectively these species are responsible for a large
     number of the diseases that afflict humans.

     Besides pathogens, which have a direct impact on human health, prokaryotes also affect humans in many indirect
     ways. For example, prokaryotes are now thought to be key players in the processes of climate change. In recent
     years, as temperatures in the earth's polar regions have risen, soil that was formerly frozen year-round (permafrost)
     has begun to thaw. Carbon trapped in the permafrost is gradually released and metabolized by prokaryotes. This
     produces massive amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, greenhouse gases that escape into the atmosphere and
     contribute to the greenhouse effect.

         · Name some ways that plants and animals rely on prokaryotes.

     Symbiotic Relationships

     As we have learned, prokaryotic microorganisms can associate with plants and animals. Often, this association
     results in unique relationships between organisms. For example, bacteria living on the roots or leaves of a plant get
     nutrients from the plant and, in return, produce substances that protect the plant from pathogens. On the other
     hand, some bacteria are plant pathogens that use mechanisms of infection similar to bacterial pathogens of animals
     and humans.

     Prokaryotes live in a community, or a group of interacting populations of organisms. A population is a group of
     individual organisms belonging to the same biological species and limited to a certain geographic area. Populations
     can have cooperative interactions, which benefit the populations, or competitive interactions, in which one
     population competes with another for resources. The study of these interactions between microbial populations and
     their environment is called microbial ecology.

     Any interaction between different species that are associated with each other within a community is called
     symbiosis. Such interactions fall along a continuum between opposition and cooperation. Interactions in a

symbiotic relationship may be beneficial or harmful, or have no effect on one or both of the species involved. Table
4.1 summarizes the main types of symbiotic interactions among prokaryotes.

TABLE 4.1

When two species benefit from each other, the symbiosis is called mutualism (or syntropy, or crossfeeding). For
example, humans have a mutualistic relationship with the bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which lives in
the intestinal tract. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron digests complex polysaccharide plant materials that human
digestive enzymes cannot break down, converting them into monosaccharides that can be absorbed by human cells.
Humans also have a mutualistic relationship with certain strains of Escherichia coli, another bacterium found in the
gut. E. coli relies on intestinal contents for nutrients, and humans derive certain vitamins from E. coli, particularly
vitamin K, which is required for the formation of blood clotting factors. (This is only true for some strains of E. coli,
however. Other strains are pathogenic and do not have a mutualistic relationship with humans.)

A type of symbiosis in which one population harms another but remains unaffected itself is called amensalism. In
the case of bacteria, some amensalist species produce bactericidal substances that kill other species of bacteria.
The microbiota of the skin is composed of a variety of bacterial species, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and
Propionibacterium acnes. Although both species have the potential to cause infectious diseases when protective
barriers are breached, they both produce a variety of antibacterial bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like compounds. S.
epidermidis and P. acnes are unaffected by the bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like compounds they produce, but
these compounds can target and kill other potential pathogens.

In another type of symbiosis, called commensalism, one organism benefits while the other is unaffected. This
occurs when the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis uses the dead cells of the human skin as nutrients. Billions
of these bacteria live on our skin, but in most cases (especially when our immune system is healthy), we do not react
to them in any way. S. epidermidis provides an excellent example of how the classifications of symbiotic
relationships are not always distinct. One could also consider the symbiotic relationship of S. epidermidis with
humans as mutualism. Humans provide a food source of dead skin cells to the bacterium, and in turn the production
of bacteriocin can provide an defense against potential pathogens.

If neither of the symbiotic organisms is affected in any way, we call this type of symbiosis neutralism. An example of
neutralism is the coexistence of metabolically active (vegetating) bacteria and endospores (dormant, metabolically
passive bacteria). For example, the bacterium Bacillus anthracis typically forms endospores in soil when conditions
are unfavorable. If the soil is warmed and enriched with nutrients, some B. anthracis endospores germinate and
remain in symbiosis with other species of endospores that have not germinated.

A type of symbiosis in which one organism benefits while harming the other is called parasitism. The relationship
between humans and many pathogenic prokaryotes can be characterized as parasitic because these organisms
invade the body, producing toxic substances or infectious diseases that cause harm. Diseases such as tetanus,
diphtheria, pertussis, tuberculosis, and leprosy all arise from interactions between bacteria and humans.

Scientists have coined the term microbiome to refer to all prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms and their
genetic material that are associated with a certain organism or environment. Within the human microbiome, there
134  4 · Prokaryotic Diversity

     are resident microbiota and transient microbiota. The resident microbiota consists of microorganisms that
     constantly live in or on our bodies. The term transient microbiota refers to microorganisms that are only temporarily
     found in the human body, and these may include pathogenic microorganisms. Hygiene and diet can alter both the
     resident and transient microbiota.

     The resident microbiota is amazingly diverse, not only in terms of the variety of species but also in terms of the
     preference of different microorganisms for different areas of the human body. For example, in the human mouth,
     there are thousands of commensal or mutualistic species of bacteria. Some of these bacteria prefer to inhabit the
     surface of the tongue, whereas others prefer the internal surface of the cheeks, and yet others prefer the front or
     back teeth or gums. The inner surface of the cheek has the least diverse microbiota because of its exposure to
     oxygen. By contrast, the crypts of the tongue and the spaces between teeth are two sites with limited oxygen
     exposure, so these sites have more diverse microbiota, including bacteria living in the absence of oxygen (e.g.,
     Bacteroides, Fusobacterium). Differences in the oral microbiota between randomly chosen human individuals are
     also significant. Studies have shown, for example, that the prevalence of such bacteria as Streptococcus,
     Haemophilus, Neisseria, and others was dramatically different when compared between individuals.4

     There are also significant differences between the microbiota of different sites of the same human body. The inner
     surface of the cheek has a predominance of Streptococcus, whereas in the throat, the palatine tonsil, and saliva,
     there are two to three times fewer Streptococcus, and several times more Fusobacterium. In the plaque removed
     from gums, the predominant bacteria belong to the genus Fusobacterium. However, in the intestine, both
     Streptococcus and Fusobacterium disappear, and the genus Bacteroides becomes predominant.

     Not only can the microbiota vary from one body site to another, the microbiome can also change over time within the
     same individual. Humans acquire their first inoculations of normal flora during natural birth and shortly after birth.
     Before birth, there is a rapid increase in the population of Lactobacillus spp. in the vagina, and this population serves
     as the first colonization of microbiota during natural birth. After birth, additional microbes are acquired from health-
     care providers, parents, other relatives, and individuals who come in contact with the baby. This process establishes
     a microbiome that will continue to evolve over the course of the individual's life as new microbes colonize and are
     eliminated from the body. For example, it is estimated that within a 9-hour period, the microbiota of the small
     intestine can change so that half of the microbial inhabitants will be different.5 The importance of the initial
     Lactobacillus colonization during vaginal child birth is highlighted by studies demonstrating a higher incidence of
     diseases in individuals born by cesarean section, compared to those born vaginally. Studies have shown that babies
     born vaginally are predominantly colonized by vaginal lactobacillus, whereas babies born by cesarean section are
     more frequently colonized by microbes of the normal skin microbiota, including common hospital-acquired
     pathogens.

     Throughout the body, resident microbiotas are important for human health because they occupy niches that might
     be otherwise taken by pathogenic microorganisms. For instance, Lactobacillus spp. are the dominant bacterial
     species of the normal vaginal microbiota for most females. lactobacillus produce lactic acid, contributing to the
     acidity of the vagina and inhibiting the growth of pathogenic yeasts. However, when the population of the resident
     microbiota is decreased for some reason (e.g., because of taking antibiotics), the pH of the vagina increases, making
     it a more favorable environment for the growth of yeasts such as Candida albicans. Antibiotic therapy can also
     disrupt the microbiota of the intestinal tract and respiratory tract, increasing the risk for secondary infections and/or
     promoting the long-term carriage and shedding of pathogens.

classify them according to the presence or absence of interbreeding. Also, they do not have many morphological
features. Traditionally, the classification of prokaryotes was based on their shape, staining patterns, and
biochemical or physiological differences. More recently, as technology has improved, the nucleotide sequences in
genes have become an important criterion of microbial classification.

In 1923, American microbiologist David Hendricks Bergey (1860-1937) published A Manual in Determinative
Bacteriology. With this manual, he attempted to summarize the information about the kinds of bacteria known at
that time, using Latin binomial classification. Bergey also included the morphological, physiological, and
biochemical properties of these organisms. His manual has been updated multiple times to include newer bacteria
and their properties. It is a great aid in bacterial taxonomy and methods of characterization of bacteria. A more
recent sister publication, the five-volume Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, expands on Bergey's original
manual. It includes a large number of additional species, along with up-to-date descriptions of the taxonomy and
biological properties of all named prokaryotic taxa. This publication incorporates the approved names of bacteria as
determined by the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN).

Classification by Staining Patterns
According to their staining patterns, which depend on the properties of their cell walls, bacteria have traditionally
been classified into gram-positive, gram-negative, and "atypical," meaning neither gram-positive nor gram-negative.
As explained in Staining Microscopic Specimens, gram-positive bacteria possess a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that
retains the primary stain (crystal violet) during the decolorizing step; they remain purple after the gram-stain
procedure because the crystal violet dominates the light red/pink color of the secondary counterstain, safranin. In
contrast, gram-negative bacteria possess a thin peptidoglycan cell wall that does not prevent the crystal violet from
washing away during the decolorizing step; therefore, they appear light red/pink after staining with the safranin.
Bacteria that cannot be stained by the standard Gram stain procedure are called atypical bacteria. Included in the
atypical category are species of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. Rickettsia are also considered atypical because they
are too small to be evaluated by the Gram stain.

More recently, scientists have begun to further classify gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. They have added
a special group of deeply branching bacteria based on a combination of physiological, biochemical, and genetic
features. They also now further classify gram-negative bacteria into Proteobacteria, Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-
Bacteroides (CFB), and spirochetes.

The deeply branching bacteria are thought to be a very early evolutionary form of bacteria (see Deeply Branching
Bacteria). They live in hot, acidic, ultraviolet-light-exposed, and anaerobic (deprived of oxygen) conditions.
Proteobacteria is a phylum of very diverse groups of gram-negative bacteria; it includes some important human
pathogens (e.g., E. coli and Bordetella pertussis). The CFB group of bacteria includes components of the normal
human gut microbiota, like Bacteroides. The spirochetes are spiral-shaped bacteria and include the pathogen
Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis. We will characterize these groups of bacteria in more detail later in the
chapter.

Based on their prevalence of guanine and cytosine nucleotides, gram-positive bacteria are also classified into low
G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria. The low G+C gram-positive bacteria have less than 50% of guanine and
cytosine nucleotides in their DNA. They include human pathogens, such as those that cause anthrax (Bacillus
anthracis), tetanus (Clostridium tetani), and listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes). High G+C gram-positive bacteria,
which have more than 50% guanine and cytosine nucleotides in their DNA, include the bacteria that cause
diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtheriae), tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and other diseases.

The classifications of prokaryotes are constantly changing as new species are being discovered. We will describe
them in more detail, along with the diseases they cause, in later sections and chapters.

             MICRO CONNECTIONS

     Human Microbiome Project

     The Human Microbiome Project was launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2008. One main goal of
     the project is to create a large repository of the gene sequences of important microbes found in humans, helping
     biologists and clinicians understand the dynamics of the human microbiome and the relationship between the
     human microbiota and diseases. A network of labs working together has been compiling the data from swabs of
     several areas of the skin, gut, and mouth from hundreds of individuals.

     One of the challenges in understanding the human microbiome has been the difficulty of culturing many of the
     microbes that inhabit the human body. It has been estimated that we are only able to culture 1% of the bacteria in
     nature and that we are unable to grow the remaining 99%. To address this challenge, researchers have used
     metagenomic analysis, which studies genetic material harvested directly from microbial communities, as opposed
     to that of individual species grown in a culture. This allows researchers to study the genetic material of all microbes
     in the microbiome, rather than just those that can be cultured.6

     One important achievement of the Human Microbiome Project is establishing the first reference database on
     microorganisms living in and on the human body. Many of the microbes in the microbiome are beneficial, but some
     are not. It was found, somewhat unexpectedly, that all of us have some serious microbial pathogens in our
     microbiota. For example, the conjunctiva of the human eye contains 24 genera of bacteria and numerous pathogenic
     species.7 A healthy human mouth contains a number of species of the genus Streptococcus, including pathogenic
     species S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae.8 This raises the question of why certain prokaryotic organisms exist
     commensally in certain individuals but act as deadly pathogens in others. Also unexpected was the number of
     organisms that had never been cultured. For example, in one metagenomic study of the human gut microbiota, 174
     new species of bacteria were identified.9

     Another goal for the near future is to characterize the human microbiota in patients with different diseases and to
     find out whether there are any relationships between the contents of an individual's microbiota and risk for or
     susceptibility to specific diseases. Analyzing the microbiome in a person with a specific disease may reveal new
     ways to fight diseases.

In 1987, the American microbiologist Carl Woese (1928-2012) suggested that a large and diverse group of bacteria
that he called "purple bacteria and their relatives" should be defined as a separate phylum within the domain
Bacteria based on the similarity of the nucleotide sequences in their genome.10 This phylum of gram-negative
bacteria subsequently received the name Proteobacteria. It includes many bacteria that are part of the normal
human microbiota as well as many pathogens. The Proteobacteria are further divided into five classes:
Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria
(Appendix D).

Alphaproteobacteria

The first class of Proteobacteria is the Alphaproteobacteria, many of which are obligate or facultative intracellular
bacteria. Some species are characterized as oligotrophs, organisms capable of living in low-nutrient environments
such as deep oceanic sediments, glacial ice, or deep undersurface soil.

Among the Alphaproteobacteria are rickettsias, obligate intracellular pathogens, that require part of their life cycle
to occur inside other cells called host cells. When not growing inside a host cell, Rickettsia are metabolically inactive
outside the host cell. They cannot synthesize their own adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and, therefore, rely on cells
for their energy needs.

Rickettsia spp. include a number of serious human pathogens. For example, R. rickettsii causes Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, a life-threatening form of meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the membranes that wrap the brain).
R. rickettsii infects ticks and can be transmitted to humans via a bite from an infected tick (Figure 4.4).

FIGURE 4.4 Rickettsias require special staining methods to see them under a microscope. Here, R. rickettsii, which causes Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, is shown infecting the cells of a tick. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Another species of Rickettsia, R. prowazekii, is spread by lice. It causes epidemic typhus, a severe infectious disease
common during warfare and mass migrations of people. R. prowazekii infects human endothelium cells, causing
inflammation of the inner lining of blood vessels, high fever, abdominal pain, and sometimes delirium. A relative, R.
typhi, causes a less severe disease known as murine or endemic typhus, which is still observed in the southwestern
United States during warm seasons.

     Betaproteobacteria

     Betaproteobacteria are a diverse group of bacteria. The different bacterial species within this group utilize a wide
     range of metabolic strategies and can survive in a range of environments. Some genera include species that are
     human pathogens, able to cause severe, sometimes life-threatening disease. The genus Neisseria, for example,
     includes the bacteria N. gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the STI gonorrhea, and N. meningitides, the causative
     agent of bacterial meningitis.

Neisseria are cocci that live on mucosal surfaces of the human body. They are fastidious, or difficult to culture, and
they require high levels of moisture, nutrient supplements, and carbon dioxide. Also, Neisseria are microaerophilic,
meaning that they require low levels of oxygen. For optimal growth and for the purposes of identification, Neisseria
spp. are grown on chocolate agar (i.e., agar supplemented by partially hemolyzed red blood cells). Their
characteristic pattern of growth in culture is diplococcal: pairs of cells resembling coffee beans (Figure 4.5).

    FIGURE 4.5 Neisseria meningitidis growing in colonies on a chocolate agar plate. (credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

The pathogen responsible for pertussis (whooping cough) is also a member of Betaproteobacteria. The bacterium
Bordetella pertussis, from the order Burkholderiales, produces several toxins that paralyze the movement of cilia in
the human respiratory tract and directly damage cells of the respiratory tract, causing a severe cough.

     Gammaproteobacteria

     The most diverse class of gram-negative bacteria is Gammaproteobacteria, and it includes a number of human
     pathogens. For example, a large and diverse family, Pseudomonaceae, includes the genus Pseudomonas. Within this
     genus is the species P. aeruginosa, a pathogen responsible for diverse infections in various regions of the body. P.
     aeruginosa is a strictly aerobic, nonfermenting, highly motile bacterium. It often infects wounds and burns, can be
     the cause of chronic urinary tract infections, and can be an important cause of respiratory infections in patients with
     cystic fibrosis or patients on mechanical ventilators. Infections by P. aeruginosa are often difficult to treat because
     the bacterium is resistant to many antibiotics and has a remarkable ability to form biofilms. Other representatives of
     Pseudomonas include the fluorescent (glowing) bacterium P. fluorescens and the soil bacteria P. putida, which is
     known for its ability to degrade xenobiotics (substances not naturally produced or found in living organisms).

     The Pasteurellaceae also includes several clinically relevant genera and species. This family includes several
     bacteria that are human and/or animal pathogens. For example, Pasteurella haemolytica causes severe pneumonia
     in sheep and goats. P. multocida is a species that can be transmitted from animals to humans through bites, causing
     infections of the skin and deeper tissues. The genus Haemophilus contains two human pathogens, H. influenzae and
     H. ducreyi. Despite its name, H. influenzae does not cause influenza (which is a viral disease). H. influenzae can
     cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, ear infections, and
     pneumonia. Before the development of effective vaccination, strains of H. influenzae were a leading cause of more
     invasive diseases, like meningitis in children. H. ducreyi causes the STI known as chancroid.

     The order Vibrionales includes the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. This comma-shaped aquatic bacterium thrives
     in highly alkaline environments like shallow lagoons and sea ports. A toxin produced by V. cholerae causes
     hypersecretion of electrolytes and water in the large intestine, leading to profuse watery diarrhea and dehydration.
     V. parahaemolyticus is also a cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans, whereas V. vulnificus causes serious and
     potentially life-threatening cellulitis (infection of the skin and deeper tissues) and blood-borne infections. Another
     representative of Vibrionales, Aliivibrio fischeri, engages in a symbiotic relationship with squid. The squid provides

The genus Legionella also belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria. L. pneumophila, the pathogen responsible for
Legionnaires disease, is an aquatic bacterium that tends to inhabit pools of warm water, such as those found in the
tanks of air conditioning units in large buildings (Figure 4.8). Because the bacteria can spread in aerosols, outbreaks
of Legionnaires disease often affect residents of a building in which the water has become contaminated with
Legionella. In fact, these bacteria derive their name from the first known outbreak of Legionnaires disease, which
occurred in a hotel hosting an American Legion veterans' association convention in Philadelphia in 1976.

disease often originate in the air conditioning units of large buildings when water in or near the system becomes contaminated with L.
pneumophila. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of enteric (intestinal) bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria. They are
facultative anaerobes and are able to ferment carbohydrates. Within this family, microbiologists recognize two
distinct categories. The first category is called the coliforms, after its prototypical bacterium species, Escherichia
coli. Coliforms are able to ferment lactose completely (i.e., with the production of acid and gas). The second
category, noncoliforms, either cannot ferment lactose or can only ferment it incompletely (producing either acid or
gas, but not both). The noncoliforms include some notable human pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., Shigella
spp., and Yersinia pestis.
E. coli has been perhaps the most studied bacterium since it was first described in 1886 by Theodor Escherich
(1857-1911). Many strains of E. coli are in mutualistic relationships with humans. However, some strains produce a
potentially deadly toxin called Shiga toxin. Shiga toxin is one of the most potent bacterial toxins identified. Upon
entering target cells, Shiga toxin interacts with ribosomes, stopping protein synthesis. Lack of protein synthesis
leads to cellular death and hemorrhagic colitis, characterized by inflammation of intestinal tract and bloody
diarrhea. In the most severe cases, patients can develop a deadly hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other E. coli strains
may cause traveler's diarrhea, a less severe but very widespread disease.

     The genus Salmonella, which belongs to the noncoliform group of Enterobacteriaceae, is interesting in that there is
     still no consensus about how many species it includes. Scientists have reclassified many of the groups they once
     thought to be species as serotypes (also called serovars), which are strains or variations of the same species of
     bacteria. Their classification is based on patterns of reactivity by animal antisera against molecules on the surface of
     the bacterial cells. A number of serotypes of Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, characterized by inflammation of
     the small and the large intestine, accompanied by fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The species S. enterobacterica
     (serovar typhi) causes typhoid fever, with symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, and skin rashes (Figure 4.9).

· List two families of Gammaproteobacteria.

Deltaproteobacteria

The Deltaproteobacteria is a small class of gram-negative Proteobacteria that includes sulfate-reducing bacteria
(SRBs), so named because they use sulfate as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. Few SRBs
are pathogenic. However, the SRB Desulfovibrio orale is associated with periodontal disease (disease of the gums).

Deltaproteobacteria also includes the genus Bdellovibrio, species of which are parasites of other gram-negative
bacteria. Bdellovibrio invades the cells of the host bacterium, positioning itself in the periplasm, the space between
144  4 · Prokaryotic Diversity

     the plasma membrane and the cell wall, feeding on the host's proteins and polysaccharides. The infection is lethal
     for the host cells.

     Another type of Deltaproteobacteria, myxobacteria, lives in the soil, scavenging inorganic compounds. Motile and
     highly social, they interact with other bacteria within and outside their own group. They can form multicellular,
     macroscopic "fruiting bodies" (Figure 4.10), structures that are still being studied by biologists and bacterial
     ecologists.11 These bacteria can also form metabolically inactive myxospores.

Epsilonproteobacteria are Campylobacter and Helicobacter, both of which include human pathogens.
Campylobacter can cause food poisoning that manifests as severe enteritis (inflammation in the small intestine).
This condition, caused by the species C. jejuni, is rather common in developed countries, usually because of eating
contaminated poultry products. Chickens often harbor C. jejuni in their gastrointestinal tract and feces, and their
meat can become contaminated during processing.

Within the genus Helicobacter, the helical, flagellated bacterium H. pylori has been identified as a beneficial
member of the stomach microbiota, but it is also the most common cause of chronic gastritis and ulcers of the
stomach and duodenum (Figure 4.11). Studies have also shown that H. pylori is linked to stomach cancer.12 H.
pylori is somewhat unusual in its ability to survive in the highly acidic environment of the stomach. It produces
urease and other enzymes that modify its environment to make it less acidic.

     4.3 Nonproteobacteria Gram-Negative Bacteria and Phototrophic Bacteria

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the unique features of nonproteobacteria gram-negative bacteria
         · Give an example of a nonproteobacteria bacterium in each category
         · Describe the unique features of phototrophic bacteria
         · Identify phototrophic bacteria

     The majority of the gram-negative bacteria belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, discussed in the previous section.
     Those that do not are called the nonproteobacteria. In this section, we will describe four classes of gram-negative
     nonproteobacteria: Chlamydia, the spirochetes, the CFB group, and the Planctomycetes. A diverse group of
     phototrophic bacteria that includes Proteobacteria and nonproteobacteria will be discussed at the end of this
     section.

     Chlamydia

     C. trachomatis is a human pathogen that causes trachoma, a disease of the eyes, often leading to blindness. C.
     trachomatis also causes the sexually transmitted disease lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). This disease is often
     mildly symptomatic, manifesting as regional lymph node swelling, or it may be asymptomatic, but it is extremely
     contagious and is common on college campuses.

     Members of the genus Chlamydia are gram-negative, obligate intracellular pathogens that are extremely resistant to
     the cellular defenses, giving them the ability to spread from host to host rapidly via elementary bodies. The
     metabolically and reproductively inactive elementary bodies are the endospore-like form of intracellular bacteria
     that enter an epithelial cell, where they become active. Figure 4.12 illustrates the life cycle of Chlamydia.

FIGURE 4.12 Chlamydia begins infection of a host when the metabolically inactive elementary bodies enter an epithelial cell. Once inside
the host cell, the elementary bodies turn into active reticulate bodies. The reticulate bodies multiply and release more elementary bodies
when the cell dies after the Chlamydia uses all of the host cell's ATP. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention)

Spirochetes

Spirochetes are characterized by their long (up to 250 m), spiral-shaped bodies. Most spirochetes are also very
thin, which makes it difficult to examine gram-stained preparations under a conventional brightfield microscope.
Darkfield fluorescent microscopy is typically used instead. Spirochetes are also difficult or even impossible to
culture. They are highly motile, using their axial filament to propel themselves. The axial filament is similar to a
flagellum, but it wraps around the cell and runs inside the cell body of a spirochete in the periplasmic space
between the outer membrane and the plasma membrane (Figure 4.13).
148  4 · Prokaryotic Diversity

     FIGURE 4.13 Spirochetes are typically observed using darkfield microscopy (left). However, electron microscopy (top center, bottom
     center) provides a more detailed view of their cellular morphology. The flagella found between the inner and outer membranes of
     spirochetes wrap around the bacterium, causing a twisting motion used for locomotion. (credit "spirochetes" micrograph: modification of
     work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit "SEM/TEM": modification of work by Guyard C, Raffel SJ, Schrumpf ME,
     Dahlstrom E, Sturdevant D, Ricklefs SM, Martens C, Hayes SF, Fischer ER, Hansen BT, Porcella SF, Schwan TG)

     Several genera of spirochetes include human pathogens. For example, the genus Treponema includes a species T.
     pallidum, which is further classified into four subspecies: T. pallidum pallidum, T. pallidum pertenue, T. pallidum
     carateum, and T. pallidum endemicum. The subspecies T. pallidum pallidum causes the sexually transmitted
     infection known as syphilis, the third most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the United States,
     after chlamydia and gonorrhea. The other subspecies of T. pallidum cause tropical infectious diseases of the skin,
     bones, and joints.

     Another genus of spirochete, Borrelia, contains a number of pathogenic species. B. burgdorferi causes Lyme
     disease, which is transmitted by several genera of ticks (notably Ixodes and Amblyomma) and often produces a
     "bull's eye" rash, fever, fatigue, and, sometimes, debilitating arthritis. B. recurrens causes a condition known as
     relapsing fever. Appendix D lists the genera, species, and related diseases for spirochetes.

     Cytophaga, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides

     The gram-negative nonproteobacteria of the genera Cytophaga, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides are classified
     together as a phylum and called the CFB group. Although they are phylogenetically diverse, bacteria of the CFB
     group share some similarities in the sequence of nucleotides in their DNA. They are rod-shaped bacteria adapted to
     anaerobic environments, such as the tissue of the gums, gut, and rumen of ruminating animals. CFB bacteria are
     avid fermenters, able to process cellulose in rumen, thus enabling ruminant animals to obtain carbon and energy
     from grazing.

Cytophaga are motile aquatic bacteria that glide. Fusobacteria inhabit the human mouth and may cause severe
infectious diseases. The largest genus of the CFB group is Bacteroides, which includes dozens of species that are
prevalent inhabitants of the human large intestine, making up about 30% of the entire gut microbiome (Figure 4.14).
One gram of human feces contains up to 100 billion Bacteroides cells. Most Bacteroides are mutualistic. They
benefit from nutrients they find in the gut, and humans benefit from their ability to prevent pathogens from
colonizing the large intestine. Indeed, when populations of Bacteroides are reduced in the gut--as often occurs
when a patient takes antibiotics--the gut becomes a more favorable environment for pathogenic bacteria and fungi,
which can cause secondary infections.

                      FIGURE 4.14 Bacteroides comprise up to 30% of the normal microbiota in the human gut. (credit: NOAA)

Only a few species of Bacteroides are pathogenic. B. melaninogenicus, for example, can cause wound infections in
patients with weakened immune systems.

Planctomycetes

The Planctomycetes are found in aquatic environments, inhabiting freshwater, saltwater, and brackish water.
Planctomycetes are unusual in that they reproduce by budding, meaning that instead of one maternal cell splitting
into two equal daughter cells in the process of binary fission, the mother cell forms a bud that detaches from the
mother cell and lives as an independent cell. These so-called swarmer cells are motile and not attached to a
surface. However, they will soon differentiate into sessile (immobile) cells with an appendage called a holdfast that
allows them to attach to surfaces in the water (Figure 4.15). Only the sessile cells are able to reproduce.

     Phototrophic Bacteria

     The phototrophic bacteria are a large and diverse category of bacteria that do not represent a taxon but, rather, a
     group of bacteria that use sunlight as their primary source of energy. This group contains both Proteobacteria and
     nonproteobacteria. They use solar energy to synthesize ATP through photosynthesis. When they produce oxygen,
     they perform oxygenic photosynthesis. When they do not produce oxygen, they perform anoxygenic photosynthesis.
     With the exception of some cyanobacteria, the majority of phototrophic bacteria perform anoxygenic
     photosynthesis.

     One large group of phototrophic bacteria includes the purple or green bacteria that perform photosynthesis with the
     help of bacteriochlorophylls, which are green, purple, or blue pigments similar to chlorophyll in plants. Some of
     these bacteria have a varying amount of red or orange pigments called carotenoids. Their color varies from orange to
     red to purple to green (Figure 4.16), and they are able to absorb light of various wavelengths. Traditionally, these
     bacteria are classified into sulfur and nonsulfur bacteria; they are further differentiated by color.

                           FIGURE 4.16 Purple and green sulfur bacteria use bacteriochlorophylls to perform photosynthesis.

The sulfur bacteria perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, using sulfites as electron donors and releasing free
elemental sulfur. Nonsulfur bacteria use organic substrates, such as succinate and malate, as donors of electrons.

The purple sulfur bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid and get their purple color
from the pigments bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids. Bacteria of the genus Chromatium are purple sulfur
Gammaproteobacteria. These microorganisms are strict anaerobes and live in water. They use carbon dioxide as
their only source of carbon, but their survival and growth are possible only in the presence of sulfites, which they
use as electron donors. Chromatium has been used as a model for studies of bacterial photosynthesis since the
1950s.13

The green sulfur bacteria use sulfide for oxidation and produce large amounts of green bacteriochlorophyll. The
genus Chlorobium is a green sulfur bacterium. These bacteria use at least four types of chlorophyll for
photosynthesis. The most prevalent of these, bacteriochlorophyll, is stored in special vesicle-like organelles called
chlorosomes.

Purple nonsulfur bacteria are similar to purple sulfur bacteria, except that they use hydrogen rather than hydrogen
sulfide for oxidation. Among the purple nonsulfur bacteria is the genus Rhodospirillum. These microorganisms are
facultative anaerobes, which are actually pink rather than purple, and can metabolize ("fix") nitrogen. They may be
valuable in the field of biotechnology because of their potential ability to produce biological plastic and hydrogen
fuel.14

The green nonsulfur bacteria are similar to green sulfur bacteria but they use substrates other than sulfides for
oxidation. Chloroflexus is an example of a green nonsulfur bacterium. It often has an orange color when it grows in
the dark, but it becomes green when it grows in sunlight. It stores bacteriochlorophyll in chlorosomes, similar to
Chlorobium, and performs anoxygenic photosynthesis, using organic sulfites (low concentrations) or molecular
hydrogen as electron donors, so it can survive in the dark if oxygen is available. Chloroflexus does not have flagella
but can glide, like Cytophaga. It grows at a wide range of temperatures, from 35 °C to 70 °C, thus can be
thermophilic.

Another large, diverse group of phototrophic bacteria compose the phylum Cyanobacteria; they get their blue-green
color from the chlorophyll contained in their cells (Figure 4.17). Species of this group perform oxygenic
photosynthesis, producing megatons of gaseous oxygen. Scientists hypothesize that cyanobacteria played a critical
role in the change of our planet's anoxic atmosphere 1-2 billion years ago to the oxygen-rich environment we have
today.15

     Cyanobacteria have other remarkable properties. Amazingly adaptable, they thrive in many habitats, including
     marine and freshwater environments, soil, and even rocks. Roseli Ocampo-Friedmann and Imre Friedman identified
     photosynthetic cyanobacteria living within rocks in Antarctica's Dry Valleys, a barren, snowless region of with
     extremely low perceiptiation and an average temperature of -15 degrees Celsius. The discovery was the basis for
     new theories and practices in the area of astrobiology (both researchers went on to work for NASA), considering that
     Earth's polar deserts have conditions resembling those on Mars, which may provide a home to organisms similar to
     cyanobacteria. They can live as unicellular organisms or in colonies, and they can be filamentous, forming sheaths or
     biofilms. Many of them fix nitrogen, converting molecular nitrogen into nitrites and nitrates that other bacteria,
     plants, and animals can use. The reactions of nitrogen fixation occur in specialized cells called heterocysts.
     Photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria is oxygenic, using the same type of chlorophyll a found in plants and algae as the
     primary photosynthetic pigment. Cyanobacteria also use phycocyanin and cyanophycin, two secondary
     photosynthetic pigments that give them their characteristic blue color. They are located in special organelles called
     phycobilisomes and in folds of the cellular membrane called thylakoids, which are remarkably similar to the
     photosynthetic apparatus of plants. Scientists hypothesize that plants originated from endosymbiosis of ancestral
     eukaryotic cells and ancestral photosynthetic bacteria.16 Cyanobacteria are also an interesting object of research in
     biochemistry,17 with studies investigating their potential as biosorbents18 and products of human nutrition.19
     Unfortunately, cyanobacteria can sometimes have a negative impact on human health. Genera such as Microcystis
     can form harmful cyanobacterial blooms, forming dense mats on bodies of water and producing large quantities of
     toxins that can harm wildlife and humans. These toxins have been implicated in tumors of the liver and diseases of
     the nervous system in animals and humans.20

4.4 Gram-Positive Bacteria

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the unique features of each category of high G+C and low G+C gram-positive bacteria
    · Identify similarities and differences between high G+C and low G+C bacterial groups
    · Give an example of a bacterium of high G+C and low G+C group commonly associated with each category

Prokaryotes are identified as gram-positive if they have a multiple layer matrix of peptidoglycan forming the cell
wall. Crystal violet, the primary stain of the Gram stain procedure, is readily retained and stabilized within this
matrix, causing gram-positive prokaryotes to appear purple under a brightfield microscope after Gram staining. For
many years, the retention of Gram stain was one of the main criteria used to classify prokaryotes, even though some
prokaryotes did not readily stain with either the primary or secondary stains used in the Gram stain procedure.

Advances in nucleic acid biochemistry have revealed additional characteristics that can be used to classify gram-
positive prokaryotes, namely the guanine to cytosine ratios (G+C) in DNA and the composition of 16S rRNA subunits.
Microbiologists currently recognize two distinct groups of gram-positive, or weakly staining gram-positive,
prokaryotes. The class Actinobacteria comprises the high G+C gram-positive bacteria, which have more than 50%
guanine and cytosine nucleotides in their DNA. The class Bacilli comprises low G+C gram-positive bacteria, which
have less than 50% of guanine and cytosine nucleotides in their DNA.
154  4 · Prokaryotic Diversity

     Actinobacteria: High G+C Gram-Positive Bacteria

     The name Actinobacteria comes from the Greek words for rays and small rod, but Actinobacteria are very diverse.
     Their microscopic appearance can range from thin filamentous branching rods to coccobacilli. Some Actinobacteria
     are very large and complex, whereas others are among the smallest independently living organisms. Most
     Actinobacteria live in the soil, but some are aquatic. The vast majority are aerobic. One distinctive feature of this
     group is the presence of several different peptidoglycans in the cell wall.

     The genus Actinomyces is a much studied representative of Actinobacteria. Actinomyces spp. play an important role
     in soil ecology, and some species are human pathogens. A number of Actinomyces spp. inhabit the human mouth
     and are opportunistic pathogens, causing infectious diseases like periodontitis (inflammation of the gums) and oral
     abscesses. The species A. israelii is an anaerobe notorious for causing endocarditis (inflammation of the inner lining
     of the heart) (Figure 4.18).

     FIGURE 4.18 (a) Actinomyces israelii (false-color scanning electron micrograph [SEM]) has a branched structure. (b) Corynebacterium
     diphtheria causes the deadly disease diphtheria. Note the distinctive palisades. (c) The gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis
     causes bacterial vaginosis. This micrograph shows a Pap smear from a person with vaginosis. (credit a: modification of work by
     "GrahamColm"/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit c: modification of
     work by Mwakigonja AR, Torres LM, Mwakyoma HA, Kaaya EE)

     The genus Mycobacterium is represented by bacilli covered with a mycolic acid coat. This waxy coat protects the
     bacteria from some antibiotics, prevents them from drying out, and blocks penetration by Gram stain reagents (see
     Staining Microscopic Specimens). Because of this, a special acid-fast staining procedure is used to visualize these
     bacteria. The genus Mycobacterium is an important cause of a diverse group of infectious diseases. M. tuberculosis
     is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a disease that primarily impacts the lungs but can infect other parts of the
     body as well. It has been estimated that one-third of the world's population has been infected with M. tuberculosis
     and millions of new infections occur each year. Treatment of M. tuberculosis is challenging and requires patients to
     take a combination of drugs for an extended time. Complicating treatment even further is the development and
     spread of multidrug-resistant strains of this pathogen.

     Another pathogenic species, M. leprae, is the cause of Hansen's disease (leprosy), a chronic disease that impacts
     peripheral nerves and the integrity of the skin and mucosal surface of the respiratory tract. Loss of pain sensation
     and the presence of skin lesions increase susceptibility to secondary injuries and infections with other pathogens.

     Bacteria in the genus Corynebacterium contain diaminopimelic acid in their cell walls, and microscopically often
     form palisades, or pairs of rod-shaped cells resembling the letter V. Cells may contain metachromatic granules,
     intracellular storage of inorganic phosphates that are useful for identification of Corynebacterium. The vast majority
     of Corynebacterium spp. are nonpathogenic; however, C. diphtheria is the causative agent of diphtheria, a disease
     that can be fatal, especially in children (Figure 4.18). C. diphtheria produces a toxin that forms a pseudomembrane
     in the patient's throat, causing swelling, difficulty breathing, and other symptoms that can become serious if
     untreated.

     The genus Bifidobacterium consists of filamentous anaerobes, many of which are commonly found in the
     gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and mouth. In fact, Bifidobacterium spp. constitute a substantial part of the human gut
     microbiota and are frequently used as probiotics and in yogurt production.

     The genus Gardnerella, contains only one species, G. vaginalis. This species is defined as "gram-variable" because
     its small coccobacilli do not show consistent results when Gram stained (Figure 4.18). Based on its genome, it is

placed into the high G+C gram-positive group. G. vaginalis can cause bacterial vaginosis; symptoms are typically
mild or even undetectable, but can lead to complications during pregnancy.

       Based on her symptoms, Marsha's doctor suspected that she had a case of tuberculosis. Although less common
       in the United States, tuberculosis is still extremely common in many parts of the world, including Nigeria.
       Marsha's work there in a medical lab likely exposed her to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that
       causes tuberculosis.

       Marsha's doctor ordered her to stay at home, wear a respiratory mask, and confine herself to one room as much
       as possible. He also said that Marsha had to take one semester off school. He prescribed isoniazid and rifampin,
       antibiotics used in a drug cocktail to treat tuberculosis, which Marsha was to take three times a day for at least
       three months.

     Clostridia
     One large and diverse class of low G+C gram-positive bacteria is Clostridia. The best studied genus of this class is
     Clostridium. These rod-shaped bacteria are generally obligate anaerobes that produce endospores and can be
     found in anaerobic habitats like soil and aquatic sediments rich in organic nutrients. The endospores may survive for
     many years.

     Clostridium spp. produce more kinds of protein toxins than any other bacterial genus, and several species are
     human pathogens. C. perfringens is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the United States and is the
     causative agent of an even more serious disease called gas gangrene. Gas gangrene occurs when C. perfringens
     endospores enter a wound and germinate, becoming viable bacterial cells and producing a toxin that can cause the
     necrosis (death) of tissue. C. tetani, which causes tetanus, produces a neurotoxin that is able to enter neurons,
     travel to regions of the central nervous system where it blocks the inhibition of nerve impulses involved in muscle
     contractions, and cause a life-threatening spastic paralysis. C. botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxin, the most

lethal biological toxin known. Botulinum toxin is responsible for rare but frequently fatal cases of botulism. The toxin
blocks the release of acetylcholine in neuromuscular junctions, causing flaccid paralysis. In very small
concentrations, botulinum toxin has been used to treat muscle pathologies in humans and in a cosmetic procedure
to eliminate wrinkles. C. difficile is a common source of hospital-acquired infections (Figure 4.19) that can result in
serious and even fatal cases of colitis (inflammation of the large intestine). Infections often occur in patients who
are immunosuppressed or undergoing antibiotic therapy that alters the normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal
tract. Appendix D lists the genera, species, and related diseases for Clostridia.

microbiota is eradicated by antibiotics. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Lactobacillales
The order Lactobacillales comprises low G+C gram-positive bacteria that include both bacilli and cocci in the genera
Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. Bacteria of the latter three genera typically are
spherical or ovoid and often form chains.
Streptococcus, the name of which comes from the Greek word for twisted chain, is responsible for many types of
infectious diseases in humans. Species from this genus, often referred to as streptococci, are usually classified by
serotypes called Lancefield groups, and by their ability to lyse red blood cells when grown on blood agar.
S. pyogenes belongs to the Lancefield group A, -hemolytic Streptococcus. This species is considered a pyogenic
pathogen because of the associated pus production observed with infections it causes (Figure 4.20). S. pyogenes is
the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis (strep throat); it is also an important cause of various skin
infections that can be relatively mild (e.g., impetigo) or life threatening (e.g., necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh
eating disease), life threatening.

The nonpyogenic (i.e., not associated with pus production) streptococci are a group of streptococcal species that are
not a taxon but are grouped together because they inhabit the human mouth. The nonpyogenic streptococci do not
belong to any of the Lancefield groups. Most are commensals, but a few, such as S. mutans, are implicated in the
development of dental caries.

     S. pneumoniae (commonly referred to as pneumococcus), is a Streptococcus species that also does not belong to
     any Lancefield group. S. pneumoniae cells appear microscopically as diplococci, pairs of cells, rather than the long
     chains typical of most streptococci. Scientists have known since the 19th century that S. pneumoniae causes
     pneumonia and other respiratory infections. However, this bacterium can also cause a wide range of other diseases,
     including meningitis, septicemia, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis, especially in newborns, the elderly, and patients
     with immunodeficiency.

     Bacilli
     The name of the class Bacilli suggests that it is made up of bacteria that are bacillus in shape, but it is a
     morphologically diverse class that includes bacillus-shaped and cocccus-shaped genera. Among the many genera in
     this class are two that are very important clinically: Bacillus and Staphylococcus.

     Bacteria in the genus Bacillus are bacillus in shape and can produce endospores. They include aerobes or facultative
     anaerobes. A number of Bacillus spp. are used in various industries, including the production of antibiotics (e.g.,
     barnase), enzymes (e.g., alpha-amylase, BamH1 restriction endonuclease), and detergents (e.g., subtilisin).

     Two notable pathogens belong to the genus Bacillus. B. anthracis is the pathogen that causes anthrax, a severe
     disease that affects wild and domesticated animals and can spread from infected animals to humans. Anthrax
     manifests in humans as charcoal-black ulcers on the skin, severe enterocolitis, pneumonia, and brain damage due
     to swelling. If untreated, anthrax is lethal. B. cereus, a closely related species, is a pathogen that may cause food
     poisoning. It is a rod-shaped species that forms chains. Colonies appear milky white with irregular shapes when
     cultured on blood agar (Figure 4.21). One other important species is B. thuringiensis. This bacterium produces a
     number of substances used as insecticides because they are toxic for insects.

     sheep blood agar. (credit a: modification of work by "Bibliomaniac 15"/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Centers for
     Disease Control and Prevention)

     The genus Staphylococcus also belongs to the class Bacilli, even though its shape is coccus rather than a bacillus.
     The name Staphylococcus comes from a Greek word for bunches of grapes, which describes their microscopic
     appearance in culture (Figure 4.22). Staphylococcus spp. are facultative anaerobic, halophilic, and nonmotile. The
     two best-studied species of this genus are S. epidermidis and S. aureus.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

S. epidermidis, whose main habitat is the human skin, is thought to be nonpathogenic for humans with healthy
immune systems, but in patients with immunodeficiency, it may cause infections in skin wounds and prostheses
(e.g., artificial joints, heart valves). S. epidermidis is also an important cause of infections associated with
intravenous catheters. This makes it a dangerous pathogen in hospital settings, where many patients may be
immunocompromised.

Strains of S. aureus cause a wide variety of infections in humans, including skin infections that produce boils,
carbuncles, cellulitis, or impetigo. Certain strains of S. aureus produce a substance called enterotoxin, which can
cause severe enteritis, often called staph food poisoning. Some strains of S. aureus produce the toxin responsible
for toxic shock syndrome, which can result in cardiovascular collapse and death.

Many strains of S. aureus have developed resistance to antibiotics. Some antibiotic-resistant strains are designated
as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA). These strains are some of the
most difficult to treat because they exhibit resistance to nearly all available antibiotics, not just methicillin and
vancomycin. Because they are difficult to treat with antibiotics, infections can be lethal. MRSA and VRSA are also
contagious, posing a serious threat in hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis facilities, and other places where there are
large populations of elderly, bedridden, and/or immunocompromised patients. Appendix D lists the genera, species,
and related diseases for bacilli.

Mycoplasmas
Although Mycoplasma spp. do not possess a cell wall and, therefore, are not stained by Gram-stain reagents, this
genus is still included with the low G+C gram-positive bacteria. The genus Mycoplasma includes more than 100
species, which share several unique characteristics. They are very small cells, some with a diameter of about 0.2
m, which is smaller than some large viruses. They have no cell walls and, therefore, are pleomorphic, meaning that
they may take on a variety of shapes and can even resemble very small animal cells. Because they lack a
characteristic shape, they can be difficult to identify. One species, M. pneumoniae, causes the mild form of
pneumonia known as "walking pneumonia" or "atypical pneumonia." This form of pneumonia is typically less severe
than forms caused by other bacteria or viruses.

Table 4.10 summarizes the characteristics of notable genera low G+C Gram-positive bacteria.

CLINICAL FOCUS

Resolution

Marsha's sputum sample was sent to the microbiology lab to confirm the identity of the microorganism causing
her infection. The lab also performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) on the sample to confirm that the
physician has prescribed the correct antimicrobial drugs.

Direct microscopic examination of the sputum revealed acid-fast bacteria (AFB) present in Marsha's sputum.
When placed in culture, there were no signs of growth for the first 8 days, suggesting that microorganism was
either dead or growing very slowly. Slow growth is a distinctive characteristic of M. tuberculosis.

After four weeks, the lab microbiologist observed distinctive colorless granulated colonies (Figure 4.23). The
colonies contained AFB showing the same microscopic characteristics as those revealed during the direct
microscopic examination of Marsha's sputum. To confirm the identification of the AFB, samples of the colonies
were analyzed using nucleic acid hybridization, or direct nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing. When a
bacterium is acid-fast, it is classified in the family Mycobacteriaceae. DNA sequencing of variable genomic
regions of the DNA extracted from these bacteria revealed that it was high G+C. This fact served to finalize
Marsha's diagnosis as infection with M. tuberculosis. After nine months of treatment with the drugs prescribed
by her doctor, Marsha made a full recovery.

EYE ON ETHICS

Biopiracy and Bioprospecting

In 1969, an employee of a Swiss pharmaceutical company was vacationing in Norway and decided to collect
some soil samples. He took them back to his lab, and the Swiss company subsequently used the fungus
Tolypocladium inflatum in those samples to develop cyclosporine A, a drug widely used in patients who undergo
tissue or organ transplantation. The Swiss company earns more than $1 billion a year for production of
cyclosporine A, yet Norway receives nothing in return--no payment to the government or benefit for the
Norwegian people. Despite the fact the cyclosporine A saves numerous lives, many consider the means by which
the soil samples were obtained to be an act of "biopiracy," essentially a form of theft. Do the ends justify the
means in a case like this?
162  4 · Prokaryotic Diversity

     Nature is full of as-yet-undiscovered bacteria and other microorganisms that could one day be used to develop
     new life-saving drugs or treatments.21 Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies stand to reap huge profits
     from such discoveries, but ethical questions remain. To whom do biological resources belong? Should
     companies who invest (and risk) millions of dollars in research and development be required to share revenue or
     royalties for the right to access biological resources?

     Compensation is not the only issue when it comes to bioprospecting. Some communities and cultures are
     philosophically opposed to bioprospecting, fearing unforeseen consequences of collecting genetic or biological
     material. Native Hawaiians, for example, are very protective of their unique biological resources.

     For many years, it was unclear what rights government agencies, private corporations, and citizens had when it
     came to collecting samples of microorganisms from public land. Then, in 1993, the Convention on Biological
     Diversity granted each nation the rights to any genetic and biological material found on their own land. Scientists
     can no longer collect samples without a prior arrangement with the land owner for compensation. This
     convention now ensures that companies act ethically in obtaining the samples they use to create their products.

     4.5 Deeply Branching Bacteria

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the unique features of deeply branching bacteria
         · Give examples of significant deeply branching bacteria

     On a phylogenetic tree (see A Systematic Approach), the trunk or root of the tree represents a common ancient
     evolutionary ancestor, often called the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), and the branches are its
     evolutionary descendants. Scientists consider the deeply branching bacteria, such as the genus Acetothermus, to
     be the first of these non-LUCA forms of life produced by evolution some 3.5 billion years ago. When placed on the
     phylogenetic tree, they stem from the common root of life, deep and close to the LUCA root--hence the name
     "deeply branching" (Figure 4.24).

The deeply branching bacteria may provide clues regarding the structure and function of ancient and now extinct
forms of life. We can hypothesize that ancient bacteria, like the deeply branching bacteria that still exist, were
thermophiles or hyperthermophiles, meaning that they thrived at very high temperatures. Acetothermus
paucivorans, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium discovered in 1988 in sewage sludge, is a thermophile growing
at an optimal temperature of 58 °C.22 Scientists have determined it to be the deepest branching bacterium, or the
closest evolutionary relative of the LUCA (Figure 4.24).

The class Aquificae includes deeply branching bacteria that are adapted to the harshest conditions on our planet,
resembling the conditions thought to dominate the earth when life first appeared. Bacteria from the genus Aquifex
are hyperthermophiles, living in hot springs at a temperature higher than 90 °C. The species A. pyrophilus thrives
near underwater volcanoes and thermal ocean vents, where the temperature of water (under high pressure) can
reach 138 °C. Aquifex bacteria use inorganic substances as nutrients. For example, A. pyrophilus can reduce
oxygen, and it is able to reduce nitrogen in anaerobic conditions. They also show a remarkable resistance to
ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that the ancient
ancestors of deeply branching bacteria began evolving more than 3 billion years ago, when the earth was hot and
lacked an atmosphere, exposing the bacteria to nonionizing and ionizing radiation.

The class Thermotogae is represented mostly by hyperthermophilic, as well as some mesophilic (preferring
moderate temperatures), anaerobic gram-negative bacteria whose cells are wrapped in a peculiar sheath-like outer
membrane called a toga. The thin layer of peptidoglycan in their cell wall has an unusual structure; it contains
diaminopimelic acid and D-lysine. These bacteria are able to use a variety of organic substrates and produce
molecular hydrogen, which can be used in industry. The class contains several genera, of which the best known is
the genus Thermotoga. One species of this genus, T. maritima, lives near the thermal ocean vents and thrives in
temperatures of 90 °C; another species, T. subterranea, lives in underground oil reservoirs.

Finally, the deeply branching bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans belongs to a genus whose name is derived from a
Greek word meaning terrible berry. Nicknamed "Conan the Bacterium," D. radiodurans is considered a
polyextremophile because of its ability to survive under the many different kinds of extreme conditions--extreme
heat, drought, vacuum, acidity, and radiation. It owes its name to its ability to withstand doses of ionizing radiation
that kill all other known bacteria; this special ability is attributed to some unique mechanisms of DNA repair.

     4.6 Archaea

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the unique features of each category of Archaea
         · Explain why archaea might not be associated with human microbiomes or pathology
         · Give common examples of archaea commonly associated with unique environmental habitats

     Like organisms in the domain Bacteria, organisms of the domain Archaea are all unicellular organisms. However,
     archaea differ structurally from bacteria in several significant ways, as discussed in Unique Characteristics of
     Prokaryotic Cells. To summarize:

         · The archaeal cell membrane is composed of ether linkages with branched isoprene chains (as opposed to the
             bacterial cell membrane, which has ester linkages with unbranched fatty acids).

         · Archaeal cell walls lack peptidoglycan, but some contain a structurally similar substance called
             pseudopeptidoglycan or pseudomurein.

         · The genomes of Archaea are larger and more complex than those of bacteria.

     Domain Archaea is as diverse as domain Bacteria, and its representatives can be found in any habitat. Some archaea
     are mesophiles, and many are extremophiles, preferring extreme hot or cold, extreme salinity, or other conditions
     that are hostile to most other forms of life on earth. Their metabolism is adapted to the harsh environments, and
     they can perform methanogenesis, for example, which bacteria and eukaryotes cannot.

     The size and complexity of the archaeal genome makes it difficult to classify. Most taxonomists agree that within the
     Archaea, there are currently five major phyla: Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, Korarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, and
     Thaumarchaeota. There are likely many other archaeal groups that have not yet been systematically studied and
     classified.

     With few exceptions, archaea are not present in the human microbiota, and none are currently known to be
     associated with infectious diseases in humans, animals, plants, or microorganisms. However, many play important
     roles in the environment and may thus have an indirect impact on human health.

     Crenarchaeota

     Crenarchaeota is a class of Archaea that is extremely diverse, containing genera and species that differ vastly in
     their morphology and requirements for growth. All Crenarchaeota are aquatic organisms, and they are thought to be
     the most abundant microorganisms in the oceans. Most, but not all, Crenarchaeota are hyperthermophiles; some of
     them (notably, the genus Pyrolobus) are able to grow at temperatures up to 113 °C.23

     Archaea of the genus Sulfolobus (Figure 4.26) are thermophiles that prefer temperatures around 70-80°C and
     acidophiles that prefer a pH of 2-3.24 Sulfolobus can live in aerobic or anaerobic environments. In the presence of
     oxygen, Sulfolobus spp. use metabolic processes similar to those of heterotrophs. In anaerobic environments, they
     oxidize sulfur to produce sulfuric acid, which is stored in granules. Sulfolobus spp. are used in biotechnology for the
     production of thermostable and acid-resistant proteins called affitins.25 Affitins can bind and neutralize various
     antigens (molecules found in toxins or infectious agents that provoke an immune response from the body).

Another genus, Thermoproteus, is represented by strictly anaerobic organisms with an optimal growth temperature
of 85 °C. They have flagella and, therefore, are motile. Thermoproteus has a cellular membrane in which lipids form
a monolayer rather than a bilayer, which is typical for archaea. Its metabolism is autotrophic. To synthesize ATP,
Thermoproteus spp. reduce sulfur or molecular hydrogen and use carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide as a source of
carbon. Thermoproteus is thought to be the deepest-branching genus of Archaea, and thus is a living example of
some of our planet's earliest forms of life.

    · What types of environments do Crenarchaeota prefer?

Euryarchaeota

The phylum Euryarchaeota includes several distinct classes. Species in the classes Methanobacteria, Methanococci,
and Methanomicrobia represent Archaea that can be generally described as methanogens. Methanogens are unique
in that they can reduce carbon dioxide in the presence of hydrogen, producing methane. They can live in the most
extreme environments and can reproduce at temperatures varying from below freezing to boiling. Methanogens
have been found in hot springs as well as deep under ice in Greenland. Methanogens also produce gases in
ruminants and humans. Some scientists have even hypothesized that methanogens may inhabit the planet Mars
because the mixture of gases produced by methanogens resembles the makeup of the Martian atmosphere.26
The class Halobacteria (which was named before scientists recognized the distinction between Archaea and
Bacteria) includes halophilic ("salt-loving") archaea. Halobacteria require a very high concentrations of sodium
chloride in their aquatic environment. The required concentration is close to saturation, at 36%; such environments
include the Dead Sea as well as some salty lakes in Antarctica and south-central Asia. One remarkable feature of
these organisms is that they perform photosynthesis using the protein bacteriorhodopsin, which gives them, and the
bodies of water they inhabit, a beautiful purple color (Figure 4.27).

     earth; scientists have isolated its DNA from fossils that are 250 million years old.27 Another species, Haloferax
     volcanii, shows a very sophisticated system of ion exchange, which enables it to balance the concentration of salts

     Finding a Link Between Archaea and Disease

     Archaea are not known to cause any disease in humans, animals, plants, bacteria, or in other archaea. Although this
     makes sense for the extremophiles, not all archaea live in extreme environments. Many genera and species of
     Archaea are mesophiles, so they can live in human and animal microbiomes, although they rarely do. As we have
     learned, some methanogens exist in the human gastrointestinal tract. Yet we have no reliable evidence pointing to
     any archaean as the causative agent of any human disease.
     Still, scientists have attempted to find links between human disease and archaea. For example, in 2004, Lepp et al.
     presented evidence that an archaean called Methanobrevibacter oralis inhabits the gums of patients with
     periodontal disease. The authors suggested that the activity of these methanogens causes the disease.28 However,
     it was subsequently shown that there was no causal relationship between M. oralis and periodontitis. It seems more
     likely that periodontal disease causes an enlargement of anaerobic regions in the mouth that are subsequently
     populated by M. oralis.29
     There remains no good answer as to why archaea do not seem to be pathogenic, but scientists continue to
     speculate and hope to find the answer.

INTRODUCTION Although bacteria and viruses account for a large number of the infectious diseases that afflict
humans, many serious illnesses are caused by eukaryotic organisms. One example is malaria, which is caused by
Plasmodium, a eukaryotic organism transmitted through mosquito bites. Malaria is a major cause of morbidity
(illness) and mortality (death) that threatens 3.4 billion people worldwide.1 In severe cases, organ failure and blood
or metabolic abnormalities contribute to medical emergencies and sometimes death. Even after initial recovery,
relapses may occur years later. In countries where malaria is endemic, the disease represents a major public health
challenge that can place a tremendous strain on developing economies.
Worldwide, major efforts are underway to reduce malaria infections. Efforts include the distribution of insecticide-
treated bed nets and the spraying of pesticides. Researchers are also making progress in their efforts to develop
effective vaccines.2 In late 2021, R21/Matrix-M became the first vaccine to be recommended for widespread use by
the World Health Organization. At least ten other candidate vaccines are in development. The effort is an
multinational one involving governments, universities, nonprofits, philanthropists, and pharmaceutical companies.
Much of the recent progress can be credited to organizations within the most affected countries, such as the Malaria
Research and Training Center in Mali. Founded by Ogobara Duombo and Yeya Touré in the 1990s, the center has
emerged as a primary front-line research driver, including running many of the critical clinical trials that are so
important to vaccine development and approval.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Upon arriving home from school, 7-year-old Sarah complains that a large spot on her arm will not stop itching.
       She keeps scratching at it, drawing the attention of her parents. Looking more closely, they see that it is a red
       circular spot with a raised red edge (Figure 5.2). The next day, Sarah's parents take her to their doctor, who
       examines the spot using a Wood's lamp. A Wood's lamp produces ultraviolet light that causes the spot on
       Sarah's arm to fluoresce, which confirms what the doctor already suspected: Sarah has a case of ringworm.

       Sarah's mother is mortified to hear that her daughter has a "worm." How could this happen?

           · What are some likely ways that Sarah might have contracted ringworm?

     Eukaryotic microbes are an extraordinarily diverse group, including species with a wide range of life cycles,
     morphological specializations, and nutritional needs. Although more diseases are caused by viruses and bacteria
     than by microscopic eukaryotes, these eukaryotes are responsible for some diseases of great public health
     importance. For example, the protozoal disease malaria was responsible for 584,000 deaths worldwide (primarily
     children in Africa) in 2013, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The protist parasite Giardia causes a
     diarrheal illness (giardiasis) that is easily transmitted through contaminated water supplies. In the United States,
     Giardia is the most common human intestinal parasite (Figure 5.3). Although it may seem surprising, parasitic
     worms are included within the study of microbiology because identification depends on observation of microscopic
     adult worms or eggs. Even in developed countries, these worms are important parasites of humans and of domestic
     animals. There are fewer fungal pathogens, but these are important causes of illness, as well. On the other hand,
     fungi have been important in producing antimicrobial substances such as penicillin. In this chapter, we will examine
     characteristics of protists, worms, and fungi while considering their roles in causing disease.

Characteristics of Protists

The word protist is a historical term that is now used informally to refer to a diverse group of microscopic eukaryotic
organisms. It is not considered a formal taxonomic term because the organisms it describes do not have a shared
evolutionary origin. Historically, the protists were informally grouped into the "animal-like" protozoans, the "plant-
like" algae, and the "fungus-like" protists such as water molds. These three groups of protists differ greatly in terms
of their basic characteristics. For example, algae are photosynthetic organisms that can be unicellular or
multicellular. Protozoa, on the other hand, are nonphotosynthetic, motile organisms that are always unicellular.
Other informal terms may also be used to describe various groups of protists. For example, microorganisms that
drift or float in water, moved by currents, are referred to as plankton. Types of plankton include zooplankton, which
are motile and nonphotosynthetic, and phytoplankton, which are photosynthetic.

Protozoans inhabit a wide variety of habitats, both aquatic and terrestrial. Many are free-living, while others are
parasitic, carrying out a life cycle within a host or hosts and potentially causing illness. There are also beneficial
symbionts that provide metabolic services to their hosts. During the feeding and growth part of their life cycle, they
are called trophozoites; these feed on small particulate food sources such as bacteria. While some types of
protozoa exist exclusively in the trophozoite form, others can develop from trophozoite to an encapsulated cyst
stage when environmental conditions are too harsh for the trophozoite. A cyst is a cell with a protective wall, and the
process by which a trophozoite becomes a cyst is called encystment. When conditions become more favorable,
these cysts are triggered by environmental cues to become active again through excystment.

One protozoan genus capable of encystment is Eimeria, which includes some human and animal pathogens. Figure
5.4 illustrates the life cycle of Eimeria.
176  5 · The Eukaryotes of Microbiology

     FIGURE 5.4 In the sexual/asexual life cycle of Eimeria, oocysts (inset) are shed in feces and may cause disease when ingested by a new
     host. (credit "life cycle," "micrograph": modification of work by USDA)

     Protozoans have a variety of reproductive mechanisms. Some protozoans reproduce asexually and others reproduce
     sexually; still others are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. In protozoans, asexual reproduction
     occurs by binary fission, budding, or schizogony. In schizogony, the nucleus of a cell divides multiple times before
     the cell divides into many smaller cells. The products of schizogony are called merozoites and they are stored in
     structures known as schizonts. Protozoans may also reproduce sexually, which increases genetic diversity and can
     lead to complex life cycles. Protozoans can produce haploid gametes that fuse through syngamy. However, they can
     also exchange genetic material by joining to exchange DNA in a process called conjugation. This is a different
     process than the conjugation that occurs in bacteria. The term protist conjugation refers to a true form of eukaryotic
     sexual reproduction between two cells of different mating types. It is found in ciliates, a group of protozoans, and is
     described later in this subsection.

     All protozoans have a plasma membrane, or plasmalemma, and some have bands of protein just inside the
     membrane that add rigidity, forming a structure called the pellicle. Some protists, including protozoans, have
     distinct layers of cytoplasm under the membrane. In these protists, the outer gel layer (with microfilaments of actin)
     is called the ectoplasm. Inside this layer is a sol (fluid) region of cytoplasm called the endoplasm. These structures
     contribute to complex cell shapes in some protozoans, whereas others (such as amoebas) have more flexible
     shapes (Figure 5.5).

     Different groups of protozoans have specialized feeding structures. They may have a specialized structure for taking
     in food through phagocytosis, called a cytostome, and a specialized structure for the exocytosis of wastes called a
     cytoproct. Oral grooves leading to cytostomes are lined with hair-like cilia to sweep in food particles. Protozoans are
     heterotrophic. Protozoans that are holozoic ingest whole food particles through phagocytosis. Forms that are
     saprozoic ingest small, soluble food molecules.

Many protists have whip-like flagella or hair-like cilia made of microtubules that can be used for locomotion (Figure
5.5). Other protists use cytoplasmic extensions known as pseudopodia ("false feet") to attach the cell to a surface;
they then allow cytoplasm to flow into the extension, thus moving themselves forward.

Protozoans have a variety of unique organelles and sometimes lack organelles found in other cells. Some have
contractile vacuoles, organelles that can be used to move water out of the cell for osmotic regulation (salt and
water balance) (Figure 5.5). Mitochondria may be absent in parasites or altered to kinetoplastids (modified
mitochondria) or hydrogenosomes (see Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells for more discussion of these
structures).

FIGURE 5.5 (a) Paramecium spp. have hair-like appendages called cilia for locomotion. (b) Amoeba spp. use lobe-like pseudopodia to
anchor the cell to a solid surface and pull forward. (c) Euglena spp. use a whip-like structure called a flagellum to propel the cell.

Taxonomy of Protists

The protists are a polyphyletic group, meaning they lack a shared evolutionary origin. Since the current taxonomy is
based on evolutionary history (as determined by biochemistry, morphology, and genetics), protists are scattered
across many different taxonomic groups within the domain Eukarya. Eukarya is currently divided into six
supergroups that are further divided into subgroups, as illustrated in (Figure 5.6). In this section, we will primarily be
concerned with the supergroups Amoebozoa, Excavata, and Chromalveolata; these supergroups include many
protozoans of clinical significance. The supergroups Opisthokonta and Rhizaria also include some protozoans, but
few of clinical significance. In addition to protozoans, Opisthokonta also includes animals and fungi, some of which
we will discuss in Parasitic Helminths and Fungi. Some examples of the Archaeplastida will be discussed in Algae.
Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.8 summarize the characteristics of each supergroup and subgroup and list representatives
of each.

     Amoebozoa
     The supergroup Amoebozoa includes protozoans that use amoeboid movement. Actin microfilaments produce
     pseudopodia, into which the remainder of the protoplasm flows, thereby moving the organism. The genus
     Entamoeba includes commensal or parasitic species, including the medically important E. histolytica, which is
     transmitted by cysts in feces and is the primary cause of amoebic dysentery. Another member of this group that is
     pathogenic to humans is Acanthamoeba, which can cause keratitis (corneal inflammation) and blindness. The

notorious "brain eating amoeba," Naegleria fowleri, is a considered a distant relative of the Amoebozoa and is
classified in the phylum Percolozoa.

The Eumycetozoa are an unusual group of organisms called slime molds, which have previously been classified as
animals, fungi, and plants (Figure 5.9). Slime molds can be divided into two types: cellular slime molds and
plasmodial slime molds. The cellular slime molds exist as individual amoeboid cells that periodically aggregate into
a mobile slug. The aggregate then forms a fruiting body that produces haploid spores. Plasmodial slime molds exist
as large, multinucleate amoeboid cells that form reproductive stalks to produce spores that divide into gametes.
One cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, has been an important study organism for understanding cell
differentiation, because it has both single-celled and multicelled life stages, with the cells showing some degree of
differentiation in the multicelled form. Figure 5.10 and Figure 5.11 illustrate the life cycles of cellular and
plasmodial slime molds, respectively.

FIGURE 5.9 (a) The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum can be grown on agar in a Petri dish. In this image, individual amoeboid
cells (visible as small spheres) are streaming together to form an aggregation that is beginning to rise in the upper right corner of the image.
The primitively multicellular aggregation consists of individual cells that each have their own nucleus. (b) Fuligo septica is a plasmodial

FIGURE 5.11 Plasmodial slime molds exist as large multinucleate amoeboid cells that form reproductive stalks to produce spores that

Chromalveolata
The supergroup Chromalveolata is united by similar origins of its members' plastids and includes the
apicomplexans, ciliates, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, among other groups (we will cover the diatoms and
dinoflagellates in Algae). The apicomplexans are intra- or extracellular parasites that have an apical complex at one
end of the cell. The apical complex is a concentration of organelles, vacuoles, and microtubules that allows the
parasite to enter host cells (Figure 5.12). Apicomplexans have complex life cycles that include an infective
sporozoite that undergoes schizogony to make many merozoites (see the example in Figure 5.4). Many are capable
of infecting a variety of animal cells, from insects to livestock to humans, and their life cycles often depend on
transmission between multiple hosts. The genus Plasmodium is an example of this group.

     Other apicomplexans are also medically important. Cryptosporidium parvum causes intestinal symptoms and can
     cause epidemic diarrhea when the cysts contaminate drinking water. Theileria (Babesia) microti, transmitted by the
     tick Ixodes scapularis, causes recurring fever that can be fatal and is becoming a common transfusion-transmitted
     pathogen in the United States (Theileria and Babesia are closely related genera and there is some debate about the
     best classification). Finally, Toxoplasma gondii causes toxoplasmosis and can be transmitted from cat feces,
     unwashed fruit and vegetables, or from undercooked meat. Because toxoplasmosis can be associated with serious
     birth defects, pregnant people need to be aware of this risk and use caution if they are exposed to the feces of
     potentially infected cats. A national survey found the frequency of individuals with antibodies for toxoplasmosis
     (and thus who presumably have a current latent infection) in the United States to be 11%. Rates are much higher in
     other countries, including some developed countries.3 There is also evidence and a good deal of theorizing that the
     parasite may be responsible for altering infected humans' behavior and personality traits.4

     The ciliates (Ciliaphora), also within the Chromalveolata, are a large, very diverse group characterized by the
     presence of cilia on their cell surface. Although the cilia may be used for locomotion, they are often used for feeding,
     as well, and some forms are nonmotile. Balantidium coli (Figure 5.13) is the only parasitic ciliate that affects
     humans by causing intestinal illness, although it rarely causes serious medical issues except in the
     immunocompromised (those having a weakened immune system). Perhaps the most familiar ciliate is Paramecium,
     a motile organism with a clearly visible cytostome and cytoproct that is often studied in biology laboratories (Figure
     5.14). Another ciliate, Stentor, is sessile and uses its cilia for feeding (Figure 5.15). Generally, these organisms have
     a micronucleus that is diploid, somatic, and used for sexual reproduction by conjugation. They also have a
     macronucleus that is derived from the micronucleus; the macronucleus becomes polyploid (multiple sets of
     duplicate chromosomes), and has a reduced set of metabolic genes.

     Ciliates are able to reproduce through conjugation, in which two cells attach to each other. In each cell, the diploid
     micronuclei undergo meiosis, producing eight haploid nuclei each. Then, all but one of the haploid micronuclei and
     the macronucleus disintegrate; the remaining (haploid) micronucleus undergoes mitosis. The two cells then
     exchange one micronucleus each, which fuses with the remaining micronucleus present to form a new, genetically
     different, diploid micronucleus. The diploid micronucleus undergoes two mitotic divisions, so each cell has four
     micronuclei, and two of the four combine to form a new macronucleus. The chromosomes in the macronucleus then
     replicate repeatedly, the macronucleus reaches its polyploid state, and the two cells separate. The two cells are now
     genetically different from each other and from their previous versions.

Öomycetes have similarities to fungi and were once classified with them. They are also called water molds.
However, they differ from fungi in several important ways. Öomycetes have cell walls of cellulose (unlike the
chitinous cell walls of fungi) and they are generally diploid, whereas the dominant life forms of fungi are typically
haploid. Phytophthora, the plant pathogen found in the soil that caused the Irish potato famine, is classified within
this group (Figure 5.16).

     Excavata
     The third and final supergroup to be considered in this section is the Excavata, which includes primitive eukaryotes
     and many parasites with limited metabolic abilities. These organisms have complex cell shapes and structures,
     often including a depression on the surface of the cell called an excavate. The group Excavata includes the
     subgroups Fornicata, Parabasalia, and Euglenozoa. The Fornicata lack mitochondria but have flagella. This group
     includes Giardia lamblia (also known as G. intestinalis or G. duodenalis), a widespread pathogen that causes
     diarrheal illness and can be spread through cysts from feces that contaminate water supplies (Figure 5.3).
     Parabasalia are frequent animal endosymbionts; they live in the guts of animals like termites and cockroaches. They
     have basal bodies and modified mitochondria (kinetoplastids). They also have a large, complex cell structure with an
     undulating membrane and often have many flagella. The trichomonads (a subgroup of the Parabasalia) include
     pathogens such as Trichomonas vaginalis, which causes the human sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis.
     Trichomoniasis often does not cause symptoms in males, but they are able to transmit the infection. In females, it
     causes vaginal discomfort and discharge and may cause complications in pregnancy if left untreated.
     The Euglenozoa are common in the environment and include photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic species.
     Members of the genus Euglena are typically not pathogenic. Their cells have two flagella, a pellicle, a stigma
     (eyespot) to sense light, and chloroplasts for photosynthesis (Figure 5.17). The pellicle of Euglena is made of a
     series of protein bands surrounding the cell; it supports the cell membrane and gives the cell shape.
     The Euglenozoa also include the trypanosomes, which are parasitic pathogens. The genus Trypanosoma includes T.
     brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness and T. cruzi, which causes American
     trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). These tropical diseases are spread by insect bites. In African sleeping sickness,
     T. brucei colonizes the blood and the brain after being transmitted via the bite of a tsetse fly (Glossina spp.) (Figure
     5.18). The early symptoms include confusion, difficulty sleeping, and lack of coordination. Left untreated, it is fatal.

Chagas' disease originated and is most common in Latin America. The disease is transmitted by Triatoma spp.,
insects often called "kissing bugs," and affects either the heart tissue or tissues of the digestive system. Untreated
cases can eventually lead to heart failure or significant digestive or neurological disorders.

       EYE ON ETHICS

       Neglected Parasites

       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for identifying public health priorities in the
       United States and developing strategies to address areas of concern. As part of this mandate, the CDC has
       officially identified five parasitic diseases it considers to have been neglected (i.e., not adequately studied).
       These neglected parasitic infections (NPIs) include toxoplasmosis, Chagas disease, toxocariasis (a nematode
       infection transmitted primarily by infected dogs), cysticercosis (a disease caused by a tissue infection of the
       tapeworm Taenia solium), and trichomoniasis (a sexually transmitted disease caused by the parabasalid
       Trichomonas vaginalis).

       The decision to name these specific diseases as NPIs means that the CDC will devote resources toward
       improving awareness and developing better diagnostic testing and treatment through studies of available data.
       The CDC may also advise on treatment of these diseases and assist in the distribution of medications that might
       otherwise be difficult to obtain.5

       Of course, the CDC does not have unlimited resources, so by prioritizing these five diseases, it is effectively
       deprioritizing others. Given that many Americans have never heard of many of these NPIs, it is fair to ask what
       criteria the CDC used in prioritizing diseases. According to the CDC, the factors considered were the number of
       people infected, the severity of the illness, and whether the illness can be treated or prevented. Although
       several of these NPIs may seem to be more common outside the United States, the CDC argues that many cases
       in the United States likely go undiagnosed and untreated because so little is known about these diseases.6

       What criteria should be considered when prioritizing diseases for purposes of funding or research? Are those
       identified by the CDC reasonable? What other factors could be considered? Should government agencies like the
       CDC have the same criteria as private pharmaceutical research labs? What are the ethical implications of
       deprioritizing other potentially neglected parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis?

     5.2 Parasitic Helminths

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain why we include the study of parasitic worms within the discipline of microbiology
         · Compare the basic morphology of the major groups of parasitic helminthes
         · Describe the characteristics of parasitic nematodes, and give an example of infective eggs and infective

             larvae
         · Describe the characteristics of parasitic trematodes and cestodes, and give examples of each
         · Identify examples of the primary causes of infections due to nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes
         · Classify parasitic worms according to major groups

     Parasitic helminths are animals that are often included within the study of microbiology because many species of
     these worms are identified by their microscopic eggs and larvae. There are two major groups of parasitic helminths:
     the roundworms (Nematoda) and flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Of the many species that exist in these groups,
     about half are parasitic and some are important human pathogens. As animals, they are multicellular and have
     organ systems. However, the parasitic species often have limited digestive tracts, nervous systems, and locomotor
     abilities. Parasitic forms may have complex reproductive cycles with several different life stages and more than one
     type of host. Some are monoecious, having both male and female reproductive organs in a single individual, while
     others are dioecious, each having either male or female reproductive organs.

Nematoda (Roundworms)

Phylum Nematoda (the roundworms) is a diverse group containing more than 15,000 species, of which several are
important human parasites (Figure 5.19). These unsegmented worms have a full digestive system even when
parasitic. Some are common intestinal parasites, and their eggs can sometimes be identified in feces or around the
anus of infected individuals. Ascaris lumbricoides is the largest nematode intestinal parasite found in humans;
females may reach lengths greater than 1 meter. A. lumbricoides is also very widespread, even in developed
nations, although it is now a relatively uncommon problem in the United States. It may cause symptoms ranging
from relatively mild (such as a cough and mild abdominal pain) to severe (such as intestinal blockage and impaired
growth).

FIGURE 5.19 A micrograph of the nematode Enterobius vermicularis, also known as the pinworm. (credit: modification of work by Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention)

Of all nematode infections in the United States, pinworm (caused by Enterobius vermicularis) is the most common.
Pinworm causes sleeplessness and itching around the anus, where the female worms lay their eggs during the night.
Toxocara canis and T. cati are nematodes found in dogs and cats, respectively, that can be transmitted to humans,
causing toxocariasis. Antibodies to these parasites have been found in approximately 13.9% of the U.S. population,
suggesting that exposure is common.7 Infection can cause larval migrans, which can result in vision loss and eye
inflammation, or fever, fatigue, coughing, and abdominal pain, depending on whether the organism infects the eye or
the viscera. Another common nematode infection is hookworm, which is caused by Necator americanus (the New
World or North American hookworm) and Ancylostoma duodenale (the Old World hookworm). Symptoms of
hookworm infection can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia.

Trichinellosis, also called trichinosis, caused by Trichinella spiralis, is contracted by consuming undercooked meat,
which releases the larvae and allows them to encyst in muscles. Infection can cause fever, muscle pains, and
digestive system problems; severe infections can lead to lack of coordination, breathing and heart problems, and
even death. Finally, heartworm in dogs and other animals is caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis, which is
transmitted by mosquitoes. Symptoms include fatigue and cough; when left untreated, death may result.

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Part 2

  The physician explains to Sarah's mother that ringworm can be transferred between people through touch. "It's
  common in school children, because they often come in close contact with each other, but anyone can become
  infected," he adds. "Because you can transfer it through objects, locker rooms and public pools are also a
  potential source of infection. It's very common among wrestlers and athletes in other contact sports."

  Looking very uncomfortable, Sarah says to her mother "I want this worm out of me."

     Platyhelminths (Flatworms)

     Phylum Platyhelminthes (the platyhelminths) are flatworms. This group includes the flukes, tapeworms, and the
     turbellarians, which include planarians. The flukes and tapeworms are medically important parasites (Figure 5.20).

     The flukes (trematodes) are nonsegmented flatworms that have an oral sucker (Figure 5.21) (and sometimes a
     second ventral sucker) and attach to the inner walls of intestines, lungs, large blood vessels, or the liver. Trematodes
     have complex life cycles, often with multiple hosts. Several important examples are the liver flukes (Clonorchis and
     Opisthorchis), the intestinal fluke (Fasciolopsis buski), and the oriental lung fluke (Paragonimus westermani).
     Schistosomiasis is a serious parasitic disease, considered second in the scale of its impact on human populations
     only to malaria. The parasites Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum, which are found in
     freshwater snails, are responsible for schistosomiasis (Figure 5.22). Immature forms burrow through the skin into
     the blood. They migrate to the lungs, then to the liver and, later, other organs. Symptoms include anemia,
     malnutrition, fever, abdominal pain, fluid buildup, and sometimes death.

     The other medically important group of platyhelminths are commonly known as tapeworms (cestodes) and are
     segmented flatworms that may have suckers or hooks at the scolex (head region) (Figure 5.21). Tapeworms use
     these suckers or hooks to attach to the wall of the small intestine. The body of the worm is made up of segments
     called proglottids that contain reproductive structures; these detach when the gametes are fertilized, releasing
     gravid proglottids with eggs. Tapeworms often have an intermediate host that consumes the eggs, which then hatch
     into a larval form called an oncosphere. The oncosphere migrates to a particular tissue or organ in the intermediate
     host, where it forms cysticerci. After being eaten by the definitive host, the cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms
     in the host's digestive system (Figure 5.23). Taenia saginata (the beef tapeworm) and T. solium (the pork tapeworm)
     enter humans through ingestion of undercooked, contaminated meat. The adult worms develop and reside in the
     intestine, but the larval stage may migrate and be found in other body locations such as skeletal and smooth
     muscle. The beef tapeworm is relatively benign, although it can cause digestive problems and, occasionally, allergic
     reactions. The pork tapeworm can cause more serious problems when the larvae leave the intestine and colonize
     other tissues, including those of the central nervous system. Diphylobothrium latum is the largest human tapeworm
     and can be ingested in undercooked fish. It can grow to a length of 15 meters. Echinococcus granulosus, the dog
     tapeworm, can parasitize humans and uses dogs as an important host.

Food for Worms?

For residents of temperate, developed countries, it may be difficult to imagine just how common helminth infections
are in the human population. In fact, they are quite common and even occur frequently in the United States.
Worldwide, approximately 807-1,221 million people are infected with Ascaris lumbricoides (perhaps one-sixth of
the human population) and far more are infected if all nematode species are considered.8 Rates of infection are
relatively high even in industrialized nations. Approximately 604-795 million people are infected with whipworm
(Trichuris) worldwide (Trichuris can also infect dogs), and 576-740 million people are infected with hookworm
(Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale).9 Toxocara, a nematode parasite of dogs and cats, is also able to
infect humans. It is widespread in the United States, with about 10,000 symptomatic cases annually. However, one
study found 14% of the population (more than 40 million Americans) was seropositive, meaning they had been
exposed to the parasite at one time. More than 200 million people have schistosomiasis worldwide. Most of the
World Health Organization (WHO) neglected tropical diseases are helminths. In some cases, helminths may cause
subclinical illnesses, meaning the symptoms are so mild that that they go unnoticed. In other cases, the effects may
be more severe or chronic, leading to fluid accumulation and organ damage. With so many people affected, these
parasites constitute a major global public health concern.

Eradicating the Guinea Worm

Dracunculiasis, or Guinea worm disease, is caused by a nematode called Dracunculus medinensis. When people
consume contaminated water, water fleas (small crustaceans) containing the nematode larvae may be ingested.
These larvae migrate out of the intestine, mate, and move through the body until females eventually emerge
(generally through the feet). While Guinea worm disease is rarely fatal, it is extremely painful and can be
accompanied by secondary infections and edema (Figure 5.24).

FIGURE 5.24 The Guinea worm can be removed from a leg vein of an infected person by gradually winding it around a stick, like this
matchstick. (credit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

An eradication campaign led by WHO, the CDC, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the Carter Center
(founded by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter) has been extremely successful in reducing cases of dracunculiasis.
This has been possible because diagnosis is straightforward, there is an inexpensive method of control, there is no
animal reservoir, the water fleas are not airborne (they are restricted to still water), the disease is geographically
limited, and there has been a commitment from the governments involved. Additionally, no vaccines or medication
are required for treatment and prevention. In 1986, 3.5 million people were estimated to be affected. After the
eradication campaign, which included helping people in affected areas learn to filter water with cloth, only four
countries continue to report the disease (Chad, Mali, South Sudan, and Ethiopia) with a total of 126 cases reported
to WHO in 2014.10

     5.3 Fungi

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain why the study of fungi such as yeast and molds is within the discipline of microbiology
         · Describe the unique characteristics of fungi
         · Describe examples of asexual and sexual reproduction of fungi
         · Compare the major groups of fungi in this chapter, and give examples of each
         · Identify examples of the primary causes of infections due to yeasts and molds
         · Identify examples of toxin-producing fungi
         · Classify fungal organisms according to major groups

     The fungi comprise a diverse group of organisms that are heterotrophic and typically saprozoic. In addition to the
     well-known macroscopic fungi (such as mushrooms and molds), many unicellular yeasts and spores of macroscopic
     fungi are microscopic. For this reason, fungi are included within the field of microbiology.

     Fungi are important to humans in a variety of ways. Both microscopic and macroscopic fungi have medical
     relevance, with some pathogenic species that can cause mycoses (illnesses caused by fungi). Some pathogenic
     fungi are opportunistic, meaning that they mainly cause infections when the host's immune defenses are
     compromised and do not normally cause illness in healthy individuals. Fungi are important in other ways. They act
     as decomposers in the environment, and they are critical for the production of certain foods such as cheeses. Fungi
     are also major sources of antibiotics, such as penicillin from the fungus Penicillium.

     Characteristics of Fungi

     Fungi have well-defined characteristics that set them apart from other organisms. Most multicellular fungal bodies,
     commonly called molds, are made up of filaments called hyphae. Hyphae can form a tangled network called a
     mycelium and form the thallus (body) of fleshy fungi. Hyphae that have walls between the cells are called septate
     hyphae; hyphae that lack walls and cell membranes between the cells are called nonseptate or coenocytic
     hyphae). (Figure 5.25).

     FIGURE 5.25 Multicellular fungi (molds) form hyphae, which may be septate or nonseptate. Unicellular fungi (yeasts) cells form
     pseudohyphae from individual yeast cells.

     In contrast to molds, yeasts are unicellular fungi. The budding yeasts reproduce asexually by budding off a smaller
     daughter cell; the resulting cells may sometimes stick together as a short chain or pseudohypha (Figure 5.25).
     Some fungi are dimorphic, having more than one appearance during their life cycle. These dimorphic fungi may be
     able to appear as yeasts or molds, which can be important for infectivity. They are capable of changing their
     appearance in response to environmental changes such as nutrient availability or fluctuations in temperature,
     growing as a mold, for example, at 25 °C (77 °F), and as yeast cells at 37 °C (98.6 °F). This ability helps dimorphic
     fungi to survive in diverse environments. Two examples of dimorphic yeasts are the human pathogens Histoplasma
     capsulatum and Candida albicans. H. capsulatum causes the lung disease histoplasmosis, and C. albicans is
     associated with vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, and candidiasis of the skin (Figure 5.26).

yeast that can multiply in the lungs, causing the chronic lung disease histoplasmosis. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease

There are notable unique features in fungal cell walls and membranes. Fungal cell walls contain chitin, as opposed
to the cellulose found in the cell walls of plants and many protists. Additionally, whereas animals have cholesterol in
their cell membranes, fungal cell membranes have different sterols called ergosterols. Ergosterols are often
exploited as targets for antifungal drugs.

Fungal life cycles are unique and complex. Fungi reproduce sexually either through cross- or self-fertilization.
Haploid fungi form hyphae that have gametes at the tips. Two different mating types (represented as "+ type" and
"- type") are involved. The cytoplasms of the + and - type gametes fuse (in an event called plasmogamy), producing
a cell with two distinct nuclei (a dikaryotic cell). Later, the nuclei fuse (in an event called karyogamy) to create a
diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis to form spores that germinate to start the haploid stage, which
eventually creates more haploid mycelia (Figure 5.27). Depending on the taxonomic group, these sexually produced
spores are known as zygospores (in Zygomycota), ascospores (in Ascomycota), or basidiospores (in Basidiomycota)
(Figure 5.28).

Fungi may also exhibit asexual reproduction by mitosis, mitosis with budding, fragmentation of hyphae, and
formation of asexual spores by mitosis. These spores are specialized cells that, depending on the organism, may
have unique characteristics for survival, reproduction, and dispersal. Fungi exhibit several types of asexual spores
and these can be important in classification.

Fungal Diversity

The fungi are very diverse, comprising seven major groups. Not all of the seven groups contain pathogens. Some of
these groups are generally associated with plants and include plant pathogens. For example, Urediniomycetes and
Ustilagomycetes include the plant rusts and smuts, respectively. These form reddish or dark masses, respectively,
on plants as rusts (red) or smuts (dark). Some species have substantial economic impact because of their ability to
reduce crop yields. Glomeromycota includes the mycorrhizal fungi, important symbionts with plant roots that can
promote plant growth by acting like an extended root system. The Glomeromycota are obligate symbionts, meaning
that they can only survive when associated with plant roots; the fungi receive carbohydrates from the plant and the
plant benefits from the increased ability to take up nutrients and minerals from the soil. The Chytridiomycetes
(chytrids) are small fungi, but are extremely ecologically important. Chytrids are generally aquatic and have
flagellated, motile gametes; specific types are implicated in amphibian declines around the world. Because of their
medical importance, we will focus on Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Microsporidia. Figure 5.33
summarizes the characteristics of these medically important groups of fungi.

The Zygomycota (zygomycetes) are mainly saprophytes with coenocytic hyphae and haploid nuclei. They use
sporangiospores for asexual reproduction. The group name comes from the zygospores that they use for sexual
reproduction (Figure 5.27), which have hard walls formed from the fusion of reproductive cells from two individuals.
Zygomycetes are important for food science and as crop pathogens. One example is Rhizopus stolonifer (Figure
5.28), an important bread mold that also causes rice seedling blight. Mucor is a genus of fungi that can potentially
cause necrotizing infections in humans, although most species are intolerant of temperatures found in mammalian
bodies (Figure 5.28).

The Ascomycota include fungi that are used as food (edible mushrooms, morels, and truffles), others that are
common causes of food spoilage (bread molds and plant pathogens), and still others that are human pathogens.
Ascomycota may have septate hyphae and cup-shaped fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Some genera of
Ascomycota use sexually produced ascospores as well as asexual spores called conidia, but sexual phases have
not been discovered or described for others. Some produce an ascus containing ascospores within an ascocarp
(Figure 5.29).

Examples of the Ascomycota include several bread molds and minor pathogens, as well as species capable of
causing more serious mycoses. Species in the genus Aspergillus are important causes of allergy and infection, and
are useful in research and in the production of certain fermented alcoholic beverages such as Japanese sake. The
fungus Aspergillus flavus, a contaminant of nuts and stored grains, produces an aflatoxin that is both a toxin and the
most potent known natural carcinogen. Neurospora crassa is of particular use in genetics research because the
spores produced by meiosis are kept inside the ascus in a row that reflects the cell divisions that produced them,
giving a direct view of segregation and assortment of genes (Figure 5.30). Penicillium produces the antibiotic
penicillin (Figure 5.29).

Many species of ascomycetes are medically important. A large number of species in the genera Trichophyton,
Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are dermatophytes, pathogenic fungi capable of causing skin infections such as
athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that can cause
blastomycosis, a respiratory infection that, if left untreated, can become disseminated to other body sites,
sometimes leading to death. Another important respiratory pathogen is the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma
capsulatum (Figure 5.26), which is associated with birds and bats in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys.
Coccidioides immitis causes the serious lung disease Valley fever. Candida albicans, the most common cause of
vaginal and other yeast infections, is also an ascomycete fungus; it is a part of the normal microbiota of the skin,
intestine, genital tract, and ear (Figure 5.29). Ascomycetes also cause plant diseases, including ergot infections,
Dutch elm disease, and powdery mildews.

Saccharomyces yeasts, including the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, are unicellular ascomycetes with haploid and
200  5 · The Eukaryotes of Microbiology

     diploid stages (Figure 5.31). This and other Saccharomyces species are used for brewing beer.

FIGURE 5.31 The life cycle of an ascomycete is characterized by the production of asci during the sexual phase. The haploid phase is the
predominant phase of the life cycle. Whether spores are produced through sexual or asexual processes, they can germinate into haploid
hyphae.

The Basidiomycota (basidiomycetes) are fungi that have basidia (club-shaped structures) that produce
basidiospores (spores produced through budding) within fruiting bodies called basidiocarps (Figure 5.32). They are
important as decomposers and as food. This group includes rusts, stinkhorns, puffballs, and mushrooms. Several
species are of particular importance. Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus commonly found as a yeast in the
environment, can cause serious lung infections when inhaled by individuals with weakened immune systems. The
edible meadow mushroom, Agricus campestris, is a basidiomycete, as is the poisonous mushroom Amanita
phalloides, known as the death cap. The deadly toxins produced by A. phalloides have been used to study
transcription.
202  5 · The Eukaryotes of Microbiology

     FIGURE 5.32 The life cycle of a basidiomycete alternates a haploid generation with a prolonged stage in which two nuclei (dikaryon) are
     present in the hyphae.

     Finally, the Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate intracellular parasites. They lack mitochondria,
     peroxisomes, and centrioles, but their spores release a unique polar tubule that pierces the host cell membrane to
     allow the fungus to gain entry into the cell. A number of microsporidia are human pathogens, and infections with
     microsporidia are called microsporidiosis. One pathogenic species is Enterocystozoan bieneusi, which can cause
     symptoms such as diarrhea, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gall bladder), and in rare cases, respiratory illness.

     Eukaryotic Pathogens in Eukaryotic Hosts

     When we think about antimicrobial medications, antibiotics such as penicillin often come to mind. Penicillin and
     related antibiotics interfere with the synthesis of peptidoglycan cell walls, which effectively targets bacterial cells.
     These antibiotics are useful because humans (like all eukaryotes) do not have peptidoglycan cell walls.

     Developing medications that are effective against eukaryotic cells but not harmful to human cells is more difficult.
     Despite huge morphological differences, the cells of humans, fungi, and protists are similar in terms of their
     ribosomes, cytoskeletons, and cell membranes. As a result, it is more challenging to develop medications that target
     protozoans and fungi in the same way that antibiotics target prokaryotes.

     Fungicides have relatively limited modes of action. Because fungi have ergosterols (instead of cholesterol) in their
     cell membranes, the different enzymes involved in sterol production can be a target of some medications. The azole
     and morpholine fungicides interfere with the synthesis of membrane sterols. These are used widely in agriculture
     (fenpropimorph) and clinically (e.g., miconazole). Some antifungal medications target the chitin cell walls of fungi.
     Despite the success of these compounds in targeting fungi, antifungal medications for systemic infections still tend
     to have more toxic side effects than antibiotics for bacteria.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 3

       Sarah is relieved the ringworm is not an actual worm, but wants to know what it really is. The physician explains
       that ringworm is a fungus. He tells her that she will not see mushrooms popping out of her skin, because this
       fungus is more like the invisible part of a mushroom that hides in the soil. He reassures her that they are going to
       get the fungus out of her too.

       The doctor cleans and then carefully scrapes the lesion to place a specimen on a slide. By looking at it under a
       microscope, the physician is able to confirm that a fungal infection is responsible for Sarah's lesion. In Figure
       5.34, it is possible to see macro- and microconidia in Trichophyton rubrum. Cell walls are also visible. Even if the
       pathogen resembled a helminth under the microscope, the presence of cell walls would rule out the possibility
       because animal cells lack cell walls.

       The doctor prescribes an antifungal cream for Sarah's mother to apply to the ringworm. Sarah's mother asks,
       "What should we do if it doesn't go away?"

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain why algae are included within the discipline of microbiology
    · Describe the unique characteristics of algae
    · Identify examples of toxin-producing algae
    · Compare the major groups of algae in this chapter, and give examples of each
    · Classify algal organisms according to major groups

The algae are autotrophic protists that can be unicellular or multicellular. These organisms are found in the
supergroups Chromalveolata (dinoflagellates, diatoms, golden algae, and brown algae) and Archaeplastida (red
algae and green algae). They are important ecologically and environmentally because they are responsible for the
production of approximately 70% of the oxygen and organic matter in aquatic environments. Some types of algae,
even those that are microscopic, are regularly eaten by humans and other animals. Additionally, algae are the source
for agar, agarose, and carrageenan, solidifying agents used in laboratories and in food production. Although algae
are typically not pathogenic, some produce toxins. Harmful algal blooms, which occur when algae grow quickly and
produce dense populations, can produce high concentrations of toxins that impair liver and nervous-system function
in aquatic animals and humans.

Like protozoans, algae often have complex cell structures. For instance, algal cells can have one or more
chloroplasts that contain structures called pyrenoids to synthesize and store starch. The chloroplasts themselves
differ in their number of membranes, indicative of secondary or rare tertiary endosymbiotic events. Primary
chloroplasts have two membranes--one from the original cyanobacteria that the ancestral eukaryotic cell engulfed,
and one from the plasma membrane of the engulfing cell. Chloroplasts in some lineages appear to have resulted
from secondary endosymbiosis, in which another cell engulfed a green or red algal cell that already had a primary
chloroplast within it. The engulfing cell destroyed everything except the chloroplast and possibly the cell membrane
of its original cell, leaving three or four membranes around the chloroplast. Different algal groups have different
pigments, which are reflected in common names such as red algae, brown algae, and green algae.

Some algae, the seaweeds, are macroscopic and may be confused with plants. Seaweeds can be red, brown, or
green, depending on their photosynthetic pigments. Green algae, in particular, share some important similarities
with land plants; however, there are also important distinctions. For example, seaweeds do not have true tissues or
organs like plants do. Additionally, seaweeds do not have a waxy cuticle to prevent desiccation. Algae can also be
confused with cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria that bear a resemblance to algae; however, cyanobacteria are
prokaryotes (see Nonproteobacteria Gram-negative Bacteria and Phototrophic Bacteria).

Algae have a variety of life cycles. Reproduction may be asexual by mitosis or sexual using gametes.

Algal Diversity

Although the algae and protozoa were formerly separated taxonomically, they are now mixed into supergroups. The
algae are classified within the Chromalveolata and the Archaeplastida. Although the Euglenozoa (within the
supergroup Excavata) include photosynthetic organisms, these are not considered algae because they feed and are
motile.

The dinoflagellates and stramenopiles fall within the Chromalveolata. The dinoflagellates are mostly marine
organisms and are an important component of plankton. They have a variety of nutritional types and may be
phototrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic. Those that are photosynthetic use chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c2, and
other photosynthetic pigments (Figure 5.35). They generally have two flagella, causing them to whirl (in fact, the
name dinoflagellate comes from the Greek word for "whirl": dini). Some have cellulose plates forming a hard outer
covering, or theca, as armor. Additionally, some dinoflagellates produce neurotoxins that can cause paralysis in
humans or fish. Exposure can occur through contact with water containing the dinoflagellate toxins or by feeding on
organisms that have eaten dinoflagellates.
206  5 · The Eukaryotes of Microbiology

     When a population of dinoflagellates becomes particularly dense, a red tide (a type of harmful algal bloom) can
     occur. Red tides cause harm to marine life and to humans who consume contaminated marine life. Major toxin
     producers include Gonyaulax and Alexandrium, both of which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Another species,
     Pfiesteria piscicida, is known as a fish killer because, at certain parts of its life cycle, it can produce toxins harmful to
     fish and it appears to be responsible for a suite of symptoms, including memory loss and confusion, in humans
     exposed to water containing the species.

     FIGURE 5.35 The dinoflagellates exhibit great diversity in shape. Many are encased in cellulose armor and have two flagella that fit in
     grooves between the plates. Movement of these two perpendicular flagella causes a spinning motion. (credit: modification of work by
     CSIRO)

     The stramenopiles include the golden algae (Chrysophyta), the brown algae (Phaeophyta), and the diatoms
     (Bacillariophyta). Stramenopiles have chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c1/c2, and fucoxanthin as photosynthetic pigments.
     Their storage carbohydrate is chrysolaminarin. While some lack cell walls, others have scales. Diatoms have
     frustules, which are outer cell walls of crystallized silica; their fossilized remains are used to produce diatomaceous
     earth, which has a range of uses such as filtration and insulation. Additionally, diatoms can reproduce sexually and
     asexually, and the male gametes of centric diatoms have flagella providing directed movement to seek female
     gametes for sexual reproduction.

     Brown algae (Phaeophyta) are multicellular marine seaweeds. Some can be extremely large, such as the giant kelp
     (Laminaria). They have leaf-like blades, stalks, and structures called holdfasts that are used to attach to substrate.
     However, these are not true leaves, stems, or roots (Figure 5.36). Their photosynthetic pigments are chlorophyll a,
     chlorophyll c, -carotene, and fucoxanthine. They use laminarin as a storage carbohydrate.

     The Archaeplastids include the green algae (Chlorophyta), the red algae (Rhodophyta), another group of green algae
     (Charophyta), and the land plants. The Charaphyta are the most similar to land plants because they share a
     mechanism of cell division and an important biochemical pathway, among other traits that the other groups do not
     have. Like land plants, the Charophyta and Chlorophyta have chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b as photosynthetic
     pigments, cellulose cell walls, and starch as a carbohydrate storage molecule. Chlamydomonas is a green alga that
     has a single large chloroplast, two flagella, and a stigma (eyespot); it is important in molecular biology research
     (Figure 5.37).

     Chlorella is a nonmotile, large, unicellular alga, and Acetabularia is an even larger unicellular green alga. The size of
     these organisms challenges the idea that all cells are small, and they have been used in genetics research since
     Joachim Hämmerling (1901-1980) began to work with them in 1943. Volvox is a colonial, unicellular alga (Figure
     5.37). A larger, multicellular green alga is Ulva, also known as the sea lettuce because of its large, edible, green
     blades. The range of life forms within the Chlorophyta--from unicellular to various levels of coloniality to
     multicellular forms--has been a useful research model for understanding the evolution of multicellularity. The red
     algae are mainly multicellular but include some unicellular forms. They have rigid cell walls containing agar or
     carrageenan, which are useful as food solidifying agents and as a solidifier added to growth media for microbes.

     5.5 Lichens

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain why lichens are included in the study of microbiology
         · Describe the unique characteristics of a lichen and the role of each partner in the symbiotic relationship

             of a lichen
         · Describe ways in which lichens are beneficial to the environment

     No one has to worry about getting sick from a lichen infection, but lichens are interesting from a microbiological
     perspective and they are an important component of most terrestrial ecosystems. Lichens provide opportunities for
     study of close relationships between unrelated microorganisms. Lichens contribute to soil production by breaking
     down rock, and they are early colonizers in soilless environments such as lava flows. The cyanobacteria in some
     lichens can fix nitrogen and act as a nitrogen source in some environments. Lichens are also important soil
     stabilizers in some desert environments and they are an important winter food source for caribou. Finally, lichens
     produce compounds that have antibacterial effects, and further research may discover compounds that are
     medically useful to humans.

     Characteristics

     A lichen is a combination of two organisms, a green alga or cyanobacterium and fungus, living in a symbiotic
     relationship. Whereas algae normally grow only in aquatic or extremely moist environments, lichens can potentially
     be found on almost any surface (especially rocks) or as epiphytes (meaning that they grow on other plants).

     In some ways, the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae seems like a mutualism (a relationship in which
     both organisms benefit). The fungus can obtain photosynthates from the algae or cyanobacterium and the algae or
     cyanobacterium can grow in a drier environment than it could otherwise tolerate. However, most scientists consider
     this symbiotic relationship to be a controlled parasitism (a relationship in which one organism benefits and the other
     is harmed) because the photosynthetic organism grows less well than it would without the fungus. It is important to
     note that such symbiotic interactions fall along a continuum between conflict and cooperation.

     Lichens are slow growing and can live for centuries. They have been used in foods and to extract chemicals as dyes
     or antimicrobial substances. Some are very sensitive to pollution and have been used as environmental indicators.

     Lichens have a body called a thallus, an outer, tightly packed fungal layer called a cortex, and an inner, loosely
     packed fungal layer called a medulla (Figure 5.38). Lichens use hyphal bundles called rhizines to attach to the

Photosynthesis occurs in the algal zone. The medulla consists of fungal hyphae. The lower cortex also provides protection. The rhizines

Lichen Diversity

Lichens are classified as fungi and the fungal partners belong to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Lichens can
also be grouped into types based on their morphology. There are three major types of lichens, although other types
exist as well. Lichens that are tightly attached to the substrate, giving them a crusty appearance, are called crustose
lichens. Those that have leaf-like lobes are foliose lichens; they may only be attached at one point in the growth
form, and they also have a second cortex below the medulla. Finally, fruticose lichens have rounded structures and
an overall branched appearance. Figure 5.39 shows an example of each of the forms of lichens.

FIGURE 5.39 Examples of the three types of lichens are shown here. (a) This is a crustose lichen found mostly on marine rocks, Caloplaca
marina. (b) This is a foliose lichen, Flavoparmelia caperata. (c) This is a fruticose lichen, Letharia vulpina, which is sufficiently poisonous
that it was once used to make arrowheads. (credit b, c: modification of work by Jason Hollinger)

     Resolution

     Sarah's mother asks the doctor what she should do if the cream prescribed for Sarah's ringworm does not work.
     The doctor explains that ringworm is a general term for a condition caused by multiple species. The first step is
     to take a scraping for examination under the microscope, which the doctor has already done. He explains that he
     has identified the infection as a fungus, and that the antifungal cream works against the most common fungi
     associated with ringworm. However, the cream may not work against some species of fungus. If the cream is not
     working after a couple of weeks, Sarah should come in for another visit, at which time the doctor will take steps
     to identify the species of the fungus.

     Positive identification of dermatophytes requires culturing. For this purpose, Sabouraud's agar may be used. In
     the case of Sarah's infection, which cleared up within 2 weeks of treatment, the culture would have a granular
     texture and would appear pale pink on top and red underneath. These features suggest that the fungus is
     Trichophyton rubrum, a common cause of ringworm.

FIGURE 6.1 The year 2014 saw the first large-scale outbreak of Ebola virus (electron micrograph, left) in human populations in West Africa

the origin of our species. (credit left: modification of work by Thomas W. Geisbert)

CHAPTER OUTLINE
6.1 Viruses
6.2 The Viral Life Cycle
6.3 Isolation, Culture, and Identification of Viruses
6.4 Viroids, Virusoids, and Prions

INTRODUCTION Public health measures in the developed world have dramatically reduced mortality from viral
epidemics. But when epidemics do occur, they can spread quickly with global air travel. In 2009, an outbreak of
H1N1 influenza spread across various continents. In early 2014, cases of Ebola in Guinea led to a massive epidemic
in western Africa. This included the case of an infected man who traveled to the United States, sparking fears the
epidemic might spread beyond Africa.
Until the late 1930s and the advent of the electron microscope, no one had seen a virus. Yet treatments for
preventing or curing viral infections were used and developed long before that. Historical records suggest that by
the 17th century, and perhaps earlier, inoculation (also known as variolation) was being used to prevent the viral
disease smallpox in various parts of the world. By the late 18th century, Englishman Edward Jenner was inoculating
patients with cowpox to prevent smallpox, a technique he coined vaccination.1
Today, the structure and genetics of viruses are well defined, yet new discoveries continue to reveal their
complexities. In this chapter, we will learn about the structure, classification, and cultivation of viruses, and how
they impact their hosts. In addition, we will learn about other infective particles such as viroids and prions.

     Despite their small size, which prevented them from being seen with light microscopes, the discovery of a filterable
     component smaller than a bacterium that causes tobacco mosaic disease (TMD) dates back to 1892.2 At that time,
     Dmitri Ivanovski, a Russian botanist, discovered the source of TMD by using a porcelain filtering device first invented
     by Charles Chamberland and Louis Pasteur in Paris in 1884. Porcelain Chamberland filters have a pore size of 0.1
     µm, which is small enough to remove all bacteria 0.2 µm from any liquids passed through the device. An extract
     obtained from TMD-infected tobacco plants was made to determine the cause of the disease. Initially, the source of
     the disease was thought to be bacterial. It was surprising to everyone when Ivanovski, using a Chamberland filter,
     found that the cause of TMD was not removed after passing the extract through the porcelain filter. So if a bacterium
     was not the cause of TMD, what could be causing the disease? Ivanovski concluded the cause of TMD must be an
     extremely small bacterium or bacterial spore. Other scientists, including Martinus Beijerinck, continued
     investigating the cause of TMD. It was Beijerinck, in 1899, who eventually concluded the causative agent was not a
     bacterium but, instead, possibly a chemical, like a biological poison we would describe today as a toxin. As a result,
     the word virus, Latin for poison, was used to describe the cause of TMD a few years after Ivanovski's initial
     discovery. Even though he was not able to see the virus that caused TMD, and did not realize the cause was not a
     bacterium, Ivanovski is credited as the original discoverer of viruses and a founder of the field of virology.

     Today, we can see viruses using electron microscopes (Figure 6.2) and we know much more about them. Viruses are
     distinct biological entities; however, their evolutionary origin is still a matter of speculation. In terms of taxonomy,
     they are not included in the tree of life because they are acellular (not consisting of cells). In order to survive and
     reproduce, viruses must infect a cellular host, making them obligate intracellular parasites. The genome of a virus
     enters a host cell and directs the production of the viral components, proteins and nucleic acids, needed to form
     new virus particles called virions. New virions are made in the host cell by assembly of viral components. The new
     virions transport the viral genome to another host cell to carry out another round of infection. Table 6.1 summarizes
     the properties of viruses.

Hosts and Viral Transmission

Viruses can infect every type of host cell, including those of plants, animals, fungi, protists, bacteria, and archaea.
Most viruses will only be able to infect the cells of one or a few species of organism. This is called the host range.
However, having a wide host range is not common and viruses will typically only infect specific hosts and only
specific cell types within those hosts. The viruses that infect bacteria are called bacteriophages, or simply phages.
The word phage comes from the Greek word for devour. Other viruses are just identified by their host group, such as
animal or plant viruses. Once a cell is infected, the effects of the virus can vary depending on the type of virus.
Viruses may cause abnormal growth of the cell or cell death, alter the cell's genome, or cause little noticeable effect
in the cell.

Viruses can be transmitted through direct contact, indirect contact with fomites, or through a vector: an animal that
transmits a pathogen from one host to another. Arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and flies, are typical vectors
for viral diseases, and they may act as mechanical vectors or biological vectors. Mechanical transmission occurs
when the arthropod carries a viral pathogen on the outside of its body and transmits it to a new host by physical
contact. Biological transmission occurs when the arthropod carries the viral pathogen inside its body and transmits
it to the new host through biting.

In humans, a wide variety of viruses are capable of causing various infections and diseases. Some of the deadliest
218  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     emerging pathogens in humans are viruses, yet we have few treatments or drugs to deal with viral infections,
     making them difficult to eradicate.

     Viruses that can be transmitted from an animal host to a human host can cause zoonoses. For example, the avian
     influenza virus originates in birds, but can cause disease in humans. Reverse zoonoses are caused by infection of an
     animal by a virus that originated in a human.

     Fighting Bacteria with Viruses

     The emergence of superbugs, or multidrug resistant bacteria, has become a major challenge for pharmaceutical
     companies and a serious health-care problem. According to a 2013 report by the US Centers for Disease Control and
     Prevention (CDC), more than 2 million people are infected with drug-resistant bacteria in the US annually, resulting
     in at least 23,000 deaths.3 The continued use and overuse of antibiotics will likely lead to the evolution of even
     more drug-resistant strains.

     One potential solution is the use of phage therapy, a procedure that uses bacteria-killing viruses (bacteriophages) to
     treat bacterial infections. Phage therapy is not a new idea. The discovery of bacteriophages dates back to the early
     20th century, and phage therapy was first used in Europe in 1915 by the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort.4
     However, the subsequent discovery of penicillin and other antibiotics led to the near abandonment of this form of
     therapy, except in the former Soviet Union and a few countries in Eastern Europe. Interest in phage therapy outside
     of the countries of the former Soviet Union is only recently re-emerging because of the rise in antibiotic-resistant
     bacteria.5

     Phage therapy has some advantages over antibiotics in that phages kill only one specific bacterium, whereas
     antibiotics kill not only the pathogen but also beneficial bacteria of the normal microbiota. Development of new
     antibiotics is also expensive for drug companies and for patients, especially for those who live in countries with high
     poverty rates.

     Phages have also been used to prevent food spoilage. In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the
     use of a solution containing six bacteriophages that can be sprayed on lunch meats such as bologna, ham, and
     turkey to kill Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium responsible for listeriosis, a form of food poisoning. Some
     consumers have concerns about the use of phages on foods, however, especially given the rising popularity of
     organic products. Foods that have been treated with phages must declare "bacteriophage preparation" in the list of
     ingredients or include a label declaring that the meat has been "treated with antimicrobial solution to reduce
     microorganisms."6

     Viral Structures

     In general, virions (viral particles) are small and cannot be observed using a regular light microscope. They are much
     smaller than prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; this is an adaptation allowing viruses to infect these larger cells (see
     Figure 6.3). The size of a virion can range from 20 nm for small viruses up to 900 nm for typical, large viruses (see
     Figure 6.4). Recent discoveries, however, have identified new giant viral species, such as Pandoravirus salinus and
     Pithovirus sibericum, with sizes approaching that of a bacterial cell.7

In 1935, after the development of the electron microscope, Wendell Stanley was the first scientist to crystallize the
structure of the tobacco mosaic virus and discovered that it is composed of RNA and protein. In 1943, he isolated
Influenza B virus, which contributed to the development of an influenza (flu) vaccine. Stanley's discoveries unlocked
the mystery of the nature of viruses that had been puzzling scientists for over 40 years and his contributions to the
field of virology led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1946.

As a result of continuing research into the nature of viruses, we now know they consist of a nucleic acid (either RNA
or DNA, but never both) surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid (see Figure 6.5). The interior of the capsid is
not filled with cytosol, as in a cell, but instead it contains the bare necessities in terms of genome and enzymes
needed to direct the synthesis of new virions. Each capsid is composed of protein subunits called capsomeres
made of one or more different types of capsomere proteins that interlock to form the closely packed capsid.

There are two categories of viruses based on general composition. Viruses formed from only a nucleic acid and
capsid are called naked viruses or nonenveloped viruses. Viruses formed with a nucleic-acid packed capsid

     surrounded by a lipid layer are called enveloped viruses (see Figure 6.5). The viral envelope is a small portion of
     phospholipid membrane obtained as the virion buds from a host cell. The viral envelope may either be intracellular
     or cytoplasmic in origin.

     Extending outward and away from the capsid on some naked viruses and enveloped viruses are protein structures
     called spikes. At the tips of these spikes are structures that allow the virus to attach and enter a cell, like the
     influenza virus hemagglutinin spikes (H) or enzymes like the neuraminidase (N) influenza virus spikes that allow the
     virus to detach from the cell surface during release of new virions. Influenza viruses are often identified by their H
     and N spikes. For example, H1N1 influenza viruses were responsible for the pandemics in 1918 and 2009,8 H2N2
     for the pandemic in 1957, and H3N2 for the pandemic in 1968.

     immunodeficiency virus uses spikes made of glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to bind to host cells (credit a "micrograph":

     Viruses vary in the shape of their capsids, which can be either helical, polyhedral, or complex. A helical capsid
     forms the shape of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a naked helical virus, and Ebola virus, an enveloped helical virus.
     The capsid is cylindrical or rod shaped, with the genome fitting just inside the length of the capsid. Polyhedral
     capsids form the shapes of poliovirus and rhinovirus, and consist of a nucleic acid surrounded by a polyhedral
     (many-sided) capsid in the form of an icosahedron. An icosahedral capsid is a three-dimensional, 20-sided
     structure with 12 vertices. These capsids somewhat resemble a soccer ball. Both helical and polyhedral viruses can

vaccinia virus, may have features of both polyhedral and helical viruses so they are described as a complex viral
shape (see Figure 6.6). In the bacteriophage complex form, the genome is located within the polyhedral head and
the sheath connects the head to the tail fibers and tail pins that help the virus attach to receptors on the host cell's
surface. Poxviruses that have complex shapes are often brick shaped, with intricate surface characteristics not seen
in the other categories of capsid.

Classification and Taxonomy of Viruses

Although viruses are not classified in the three domains of life, their numbers are great enough to require
classification. Since 1971, the International Union of Microbiological Societies Virology Division has given the task of
developing, refining, and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy to the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV). Since viruses can mutate so quickly, it can be difficult to classify them into a genus and a species
epithet using the binomial nomenclature system. Thus, the ICTV's viral nomenclature system classifies viruses into
families and genera based on viral genetics, chemistry, morphology, and mechanism of multiplication. To date, the
ICTV has classified known viruses in seven orders, 96 families, and 350 genera. Viral family names end in -viridae
(e.g, Parvoviridae) and genus names end in -virus (e.g., Parvovirus). The names of viral orders, families, and genera
are all italicized. When referring to a viral species, we often use a genus and species epithet such as Pandoravirus
dulcis or Pandoravirus salinus.
222  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     The Baltimore classification system is an alternative to ICTV nomenclature. The Baltimore system classifies viruses
     according to their genomes (DNA or RNA, single versus double stranded, and mode of replication). This system thus
     creates seven groups of viruses that have common genetics and biology.

     Aside from formal systems of nomenclature, viruses are often informally grouped into categories based on
     chemistry, morphology, or other characteristics they share in common. Categories may include naked or enveloped
     structure, single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) DNA or ss or ds RNA genomes, segmented or nonsegmented
     genomes, and positive-strand (+) or negative-strand (-) RNA. For example, herpes viruses can be classified as a
     dsDNA enveloped virus; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a +ssRNA enveloped virus, and tobacco mosaic
     virus is a +ssRNA virus. Other characteristics such as host specificity, tissue specificity, capsid shape, and special
     genes or enzymes may also be used to describe groups of similar viruses. Table 6.2 lists some of the most common
     viruses that are human pathogens by genome type.

Classification of Viral Diseases
While the ICTV has been tasked with the biological classification of viruses, it has also played an important role in
the classification of diseases caused by viruses. To facilitate the tracking of virus-related human diseases, the ICTV
has created classifications that link to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the standard taxonomy of
disease that is maintained and updated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ICD assigns an alphanumeric
code of up to six characters to every type of viral infection, as well as all other types of diseases, medical conditions,
and causes of death. This ICD code is used in conjunction with two other coding systems (the Current Procedural
Terminology, and the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) to categorize patient conditions for treatment
and insurance reimbursement.

For example, when a patient seeks treatment for a viral infection, ICD codes are routinely used by clinicians to order
laboratory tests and prescribe treatments specific to the virus suspected of causing the illness. This ICD code is
then used by medical laboratories to identify tests that must be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The ICD code is
used by the health-care management system to verify that all treatments and laboratory work performed are
appropriate for the given virus. Medical coders use ICD codes to assign the proper code for procedures performed,
and medical billers, in turn, use this information to process claims for reimbursement by insurance companies.
Vital-records keepers use ICD codes to record cause of death on death certificates, and epidemiologists used ICD
codes to calculate morbidity and mortality statistics.

David's doctor was concerned that his symptoms included prickling and itching at the site of the dog bite; these
sensations could be early symptoms of rabies. Several tests are available to diagnose rabies in live patients, but
no single antemortem test is adequate. The doctor decided to take samples of David's blood, saliva, and skin for

       testing. The skin sample was taken from the nape of the neck (posterior side of the neck near the hairline). It
       was about 6-mm long and contained at least 10 hair follicles, including the superficial cutaneous nerve. An
       immunofluorescent staining technique was used on the skin biopsy specimen to detect rabies antibodies in the
       cutaneous nerves at the base of the hair follicles. A test was also performed on a serum sample from David's
       blood to determine whether any antibodies for the rabies virus had been produced.

       Meanwhile, the saliva sample was used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, a
       test that can detect the presence of viral nucleic acid (RNA). The blood tests came back positive for the
       presence of rabies virus antigen, prompting David's doctor to prescribe prophylactic treatment. David is given a
       series of intramuscular injections of human rabies immunoglobulin along with a series of rabies vaccines.

     6.2 The Viral Life Cycle

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the lytic and lysogenic life cycles
         · Describe the replication process of animal viruses
         · Describe unique characteristics of retroviruses and latent viruses
         · Discuss human viruses and their virus-host cell interactions
         · Explain the process of transduction
         · Describe the replication process of plant viruses

     All viruses depend on cells for reproduction and metabolic processes. By themselves, viruses do not encode for all
     of the enzymes necessary for viral replication. But within a host cell, a virus can commandeer cellular machinery to
     produce more viral particles. Bacteriophages replicate only in the cytoplasm, since prokaryotic cells do not have a
     nucleus or organelles. In eukaryotic cells, most DNA viruses can replicate inside the nucleus, with an exception
     observed in the large DNA viruses, such as the poxviruses, that can replicate in the cytoplasm. With a few
     exceptions, RNA viruses that infect animal cells replicate in the cytoplasm. An important exception that will be
     highlighted later is Influenza virus.

     The Life Cycle of Viruses with Prokaryote Hosts

     The life cycle of bacteriophages has been a good model for understanding how viruses affect the cells they infect,
     since similar processes have been observed for eukaryotic viruses, which can cause immediate death of the cell or
     establish a latent or chronic infection. Virulent phages typically lead to the death of the cell through cell lysis.
     Temperate phages, on the other hand, can become part of a host chromosome and are replicated with the cell
     genome until such time as they are induced to make newly assembled viruses, or progeny viruses.

     The Lytic Cycle
     During the lytic cycle of virulent phage, the bacteriophage takes over the cell, reproduces new phages, and destroys
     the cell. T-even phage is a good example of a well-characterized class of virulent phages. There are five stages in the
     bacteriophage lytic cycle (see Figure 6.7). Attachment is the first stage in the infection process in which the phage
     interacts with specific bacterial surface receptors (e.g., lipopolysaccharides and OmpC protein on host surfaces).
     Most phages have a narrow host range and may infect one species of bacteria or one strain within a species. This
     unique recognition can be exploited for targeted treatment of bacterial infection by phage therapy or for phage
     typing to identify unique bacterial subspecies or strains. The second stage of infection is entry or penetration. This
     occurs through contraction of the tail sheath, which acts like a hypodermic needle to inject the viral genome through
     the cell wall and membrane. The phage head and remaining components remain outside the bacteria.

     FIGURE 6.7 A virulent phage shows only the lytic cycle pictured here. In the lytic cycle, the phage replicates and lyses the host cell.

The third stage of infection is biosynthesis of new viral components. After entering the host cell, the virus
synthesizes virus-encoded endonucleases to degrade the bacterial chromosome. It then hijacks the host cell to
replicate, transcribe, and translate the necessary viral components (capsomeres, sheath, base plates, tail fibers,
and viral enzymes) for the assembly of new viruses. Polymerase genes are usually expressed early in the cycle,
while capsid and tail proteins are expressed later. During the maturation phase, new virions are created. To liberate
free phages, the bacterial cell wall is disrupted by phage proteins such as holin or lysozyme. The final stage is
release. Mature viruses burst out of the host cell in a process called lysis and the progeny viruses are liberated into
the environment to infect new cells.

The Lysogenic Cycle
In a lysogenic cycle, the phage genome also enters the cell through attachment and penetration. A prime example
of a phage with this type of life cycle is the lambda phage. During the lysogenic cycle, instead of killing the host, the
phage genome integrates into the bacterial chromosome and becomes part of the host. The integrated phage
genome is called a prophage. A bacterial host with a prophage is called a lysogen. The process in which a bacterium
is infected by a temperate phage is called lysogeny. It is typical of temperate phages to be latent or inactive within
the cell. As the bacterium replicates its chromosome, it also replicates the phage's DNA and passes it on to new
daughter cells during reproduction. The presence of the phage may alter the phenotype of the bacterium, since it
can bring in extra genes (e.g., toxin genes that can increase bacterial virulence). This change in the host phenotype
is called lysogenic conversion or phage conversion. Some bacteria, such as Vibrio cholerae and Clostridium
botulinum, are less virulent in the absence of the prophage. The phages infecting these bacteria carry the toxin
genes in their genome and enhance the virulence of the host when the toxin genes are expressed. In the case of V.
cholera, phage encoded toxin can cause severe diarrhea; in C. botulinum, the toxin can cause paralysis. During
lysogeny, the prophage will persist in the host chromosome until induction, which results in the excision of the viral
genome from the host chromosome. After induction has occurred the temperate phage can proceed through a lytic
cycle and then undergo lysogeny in a newly infected cell (see Figure 6.8).
226  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     FIGURE 6.8 A temperate bacteriophage has both lytic and lysogenic cycles. In the lysogenic cycle, phage DNA is incorporated into the host
     genome, forming a prophage, which is passed on to subsequent generations of cells. Environmental stressors such as starvation or
     exposure to toxic chemicals may cause the prophage to be excised and enter the lytic cycle.

     Transduction

     Transduction occurs when a bacteriophage transfers bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another during sequential
     infections. There are two types of transduction: generalized and specialized transduction. During the lytic cycle of
     viral replication, the virus hijacks the host cell, degrades the host chromosome, and makes more viral genomes. As it
     assembles and packages DNA into the phage head, packaging occasionally makes a mistake. Instead of packaging
     viral DNA, it takes a random piece of host DNA and inserts it into the capsid. Once released, this virion will then
     inject the former host's DNA into a newly infected host. The asexual transfer of genetic information can allow for
     DNA recombination to occur, thus providing the new host with new genes (e.g., an antibiotic-resistance gene, or a
     sugar-metabolizing gene). Generalized transduction occurs when a random piece of bacterial chromosomal DNA is
     transferred by the phage during the lytic cycle. Specialized transduction occurs at the end of the lysogenic cycle,
     when the prophage is excised and the bacteriophage enters the lytic cycle. Since the phage is integrated into the
     host genome, the prophage can replicate as part of the host. However, some conditions (e.g., ultraviolet light
     exposure or chemical exposure) stimulate the prophage to undergo induction, causing the phage to excise from the
     genome, enter the lytic cycle, and produce new phages to leave host cells. During the process of excision from the
     host chromosome, a phage may occasionally remove some bacterial DNA near the site of viral integration. The
     phage and host DNA from one end or both ends of the integration site are packaged within the capsid and are
     transferred to the new, infected host. Since the DNA transferred by the phage is not randomly packaged but is
     instead a specific piece of DNA near the site of integration, this mechanism of gene transfer is referred to as
     specialized transduction (see Figure 6.9). The DNA can then recombine with host chromosome, giving the latter new
     characteristics. Transduction seems to play an important role in the evolutionary process of bacteria, giving them a

Life Cycle of Viruses with Animal Hosts

Lytic animal viruses follow similar infection stages to bacteriophages: attachment, penetration, biosynthesis,
maturation, and release (see Figure 6.10). However, the mechanisms of penetration, nucleic-acid biosynthesis, and
release differ between bacterial and animal viruses. After binding to host receptors, animal viruses enter through
endocytosis (engulfment by the host cell) or through membrane fusion (viral envelope with the host cell membrane).
Many viruses are host specific, meaning they only infect a certain type of host; and most viruses only infect certain
types of cells within tissues. This specificity is called a tissue tropism. Examples of this are demonstrated by the
poliovirus, which exhibits tropism for the tissues of the brain and spinal cord, or the influenza virus, which has a
primary tropism for the respiratory tract.
228  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     FIGURE 6.10 Influenza virus is one of the few RNA viruses that replicates in the nucleus of cells. In influenza virus infection, viral
     glycoproteins attach the virus to a host epithelial cell. As a result, the virus is engulfed. Viral RNA and viral proteins are made and
     assembled into new virions that are released by budding.

     Animal viruses do not always express their genes using the normal flow of genetic information--from DNA to RNA to
     protein. Some viruses have a dsDNA genome like cellular organisms and can follow the normal flow. However,
     others may have ssDNA, dsRNA, or ssRNA genomes. The nature of the genome determines how the genome is
     replicated and expressed as viral proteins. If a genome is ssDNA, host enzymes will be used to synthesize a second
     strand that is complementary to the genome strand, thus producing dsDNA. The dsDNA can now be replicated,
     transcribed, and translated similar to host DNA.
     If the viral genome is RNA, a different mechanism must be used. There are three types of RNA genome: dsRNA,
     positive (+) single-strand (+ssRNA) or negative (-) single-strand RNA (-ssRNA). If a virus has a +ssRNA genome,
     it can be translated directly to make viral proteins. Viral genomic +ssRNA acts like cellular mRNA. However, if a virus
     contains a -ssRNA genome, the host ribosomes cannot translate it until the -ssRNA is replicated into +ssRNA by
     viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (see Figure 6.11). The RdRP is brought in by the virus and can be used
     to make +ssRNA from the original -ssRNA genome. The RdRP is also an important enzyme for the replication of
     dsRNA viruses, because it uses the negative strand of the double-stranded genome as a template to create +ssRNA.
     The newly synthesized +ssRNA copies can then be translated by cellular ribosomes.

FIGURE 6.11 RNA viruses can contain +ssRNA that can be directly read by the ribosomes to synthesize viral proteins. Viruses containing
-ssRNA must first use the -ssRNA as a template for the synthesis of +ssRNA before viral proteins can be synthesized.

An alternative mechanism for viral nucleic acid synthesis is observed in the retroviruses, which are +ssRNA viruses
(see Figure 6.12). Single-stranded RNA viruses such as HIV carry a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase
within the capsid that synthesizes a complementary ssDNA (cDNA) copy using the +ssRNA genome as a template.
The ssDNA is then made into dsDNA, which can integrate into the host chromosome and become a permanent part
of the host. The integrated viral genome is called a provirus. The virus now can remain in the host for a long time to
establish a chronic infection. The provirus stage is similar to the prophage stage in a bacterial infection during the
lysogenic cycle. However, unlike prophage, the provirus does not undergo excision after splicing into the genome.

tissues or organs of the infected person. The virus may remain silent or undergo productive infection without
seriously harming or killing the host. Mechanisms of persistent infection may involve the regulation of the viral or
host gene expressions or the alteration of the host immune response. The two primary categories of persistent
infections are latent infection and chronic infection. Examples of viruses that cause latent infections include herpes
simplex virus (oral and genital herpes), varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox and shingles), and Epstein-Barr virus
(mononucleosis). Hepatitis C virus and HIV are two examples of viruses that cause long-term chronic infections.

Latent Infection
Not all animal viruses undergo replication by the lytic cycle. There are viruses that are capable of remaining hidden
or dormant inside the cell in a process called latency. These types of viruses are known as latent viruses and may
cause latent infections. Viruses capable of latency may initially cause an acute infection before becoming dormant.

For example, the varicella-zoster virus infects many cells throughout the body and causes chickenpox, characterized
by a rash of blisters covering the skin. About 10 to 12 days postinfection, the disease resolves and the virus goes
dormant, living within nerve-cell ganglia for years. During this time, the virus does not kill the nerve cells or continue
replicating. It is not clear why the virus stops replicating within the nerve cells and expresses few viral proteins but,
in some cases, typically after many years of dormancy, the virus is reactivated and causes a new disease called
shingles (Figure 6.13). Whereas chickenpox affects many areas throughout the body, shingles is a nerve cell-specific
disease emerging from the ganglia in which the virus was dormant.

electron micrograph. Its double-stranded DNA genome becomes incorporated in the host DNA. (b) After a period of latency, the virus can
reactivate in the form of shingles, usually manifesting as a painful, localized rash on one side of the body. (credit a: modification of work by
Erskine Palmer and B.G. Partin--scale-bar data from Matt Russell; credit b: Paulo O / Flickr (CC-BY)

Latent viruses may remain dormant by existing as circular viral genome molecules outside of the host chromosome.
Others become proviruses by integrating into the host genome. During dormancy, viruses do not cause any
symptoms of disease and may be difficult to detect. A patient may be unaware that they are carrying the virus
unless a viral diagnostic test has been performed.

Chronic Infection
A chronic infection is a disease with symptoms that are recurrent or persistent over a long time. Some viral
infections can be chronic if the body is unable to eliminate the virus. HIV is an example of a virus that produces a
chronic infection, often after a long period of latency. Once a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus can be
detected in tissues continuously thereafter, but untreated patients often experience no symptoms for years.
However, the virus maintains chronic persistence through several mechanisms that interfere with immune function,
including preventing expression of viral antigens on the surface of infected cells, altering immune cells themselves,
restricting expression of viral genes, and rapidly changing viral antigens through mutation. Eventually, the damage to
the immune system results in progression of the disease leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The various mechanisms that HIV uses to avoid being cleared by the immune system are also used by other
chronically infecting viruses, including the hepatitis C virus.

     Life Cycle of Viruses with Plant Hosts

     Plant viruses are more similar to animal viruses than they are to bacteriophages. Plant viruses may be enveloped or
     non-enveloped. Like many animal viruses, plant viruses can have either a DNA or RNA genome and be single
     stranded or double stranded. However, most plant viruses do not have a DNA genome; the majority have a +ssRNA
     genome, which acts like messenger RNA (mRNA). Only a minority of plant viruses have other types of genomes.

     Plant viruses may have a narrow or broad host range. For example, the citrus tristeza virus infects only a few plants
     of the Citrus genus, whereas the cucumber mosaic virus infects thousands of plants of various plant families. Most
     plant viruses are transmitted by contact between plants, or by fungi, nematodes, insects, or other arthropods that
     act as mechanical vectors. However, some viruses can only be transferred by a specific type of insect vector; for
     example, a particular virus might be transmitted by aphids but not whiteflies. In some cases, viruses may also enter
     healthy plants through wounds, as might occur due to pruning or weather damage.

     Viruses that infect plants are considered biotrophic parasites, which means that they can establish an infection
     without killing the host, similar to what is observed in the lysogenic life cycles of bacteriophages. Viral infection can
     be asymptomatic (latent) or can lead to cell death (lytic infection). The life cycle begins with the penetration of the
     virus into the host cell. Next, the virus is uncoated within the cytoplasm of the cell when the capsid is removed.
     Depending on the type of nucleic acid, cellular components are used to replicate the viral genome and synthesize
     viral proteins for assembly of new virions. To establish a systemic infection, the virus must enter a part of the
     vascular system of the plant, such as the phloem. The time required for systemic infection may vary from a few days
     to a few weeks depending on the virus, the plant species, and the environmental conditions. The virus life cycle is
     complete when it is transmitted from an infected plant to a healthy plant.

     Viral Growth Curve

     Unlike the growth curve for a bacterial population, the growth curve for a virus population over its life cycle does not
     follow a sigmoidal curve. During the initial stage, an inoculum of virus causes infection. In the eclipse phase, viruses
     bind and penetrate the cells with no virions detected in the medium. The chief difference that next appears in the
     viral growth curve compared to a bacterial growth curve occurs when virions are released from the lysed host cell at
     the same time. Such an occurrence is called a burst, and the number of virions per bacterium released is described
     as the burst size. In a one-step multiplication curve for bacteriophage, the host cells lyse, releasing many viral
     particles to the medium, which leads to a very steep rise in viral titer (the number of virions per unit volume). If no
     viable host cells remain, the viral particles begin to degrade during the decline of the culture (see Figure 6.14).

  EYE ON ETHICS
  Unregistered Treatments

  Ebola is incurable and deadly. The outbreak in West Africa in 2014 was unprecedented, dwarfing other human
  Ebola epidemics in the level of mortality. Of 24,666 suspected or confirmed cases reported, 10,179 people
  died.9
  No approved treatments or vaccines for Ebola are available. While some drugs have shown potential in
  laboratory studies and animal models, they have not been tested in humans for safety and effectiveness. Not
  only are these drugs untested or unregistered but they are also in short supply.
  Given the great suffering and high mortality rates, it is fair to ask whether unregistered and untested
  medications are better than none at all. Should such drugs be dispensed and, if so, who should receive them, in
  light of their extremely limited supplies? Is it ethical to treat untested drugs on patients with Ebola? On the other
  hand, is it ethical to withhold potentially life-saving drugs from dying patients? Or should the drugs perhaps be
  reserved for health-care providers working to contain the disease?
  In August 2014, two infected US aid workers and a Spanish priest were treated with ZMapp, an unregistered
  drug that had been tested in monkeys but not in humans. The two American aid workers recovered, but the
  priest died. Later that month, the WHO released a report on the ethics of treating patients with the drug. Since
  Ebola is often fatal, the panel reasoned that it is ethical to give the unregistered drugs and unethical to withhold
  them for safety concerns. This situation is an example of "compassionate use" outside the well-established
  system of regulation and governance of therapies.

     CASE IN POINT

     Ebola in the US

     On September 24, 2014, Thomas Eric Duncan arrived at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas
     complaining of a fever, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea--symptoms commonly observed in patients with the
     cold or the flu. After examination, an emergency department doctor diagnosed him with sinusitis, prescribed
     some antibiotics, and sent him home. Two days later, Duncan returned to the hospital by ambulance. His
     condition had deteriorated and additional blood tests confirmed that he has been infected with the Ebola virus.

     Further investigations revealed that Duncan had just returned from Liberia, one of the countries in the midst of a
     severe Ebola epidemic. On September 15, nine days before he showed up at the hospital in Dallas, Duncan had
     helped transport an Ebola-stricken neighbor to a hospital in Liberia. The hospital continued to treat Duncan, but
     he died several days after being admitted.

     The timeline of the Duncan case is indicative of the life cycle of the Ebola virus. The incubation time for Ebola
     ranges from 2 days to 21 days. Nine days passed between Duncan's exposure to the virus infection and the
     appearance of his symptoms. This corresponds, in part, to the eclipse period in the growth of the virus
     population. During the eclipse phase, Duncan would have been unable to transmit the disease to others.
     However, once an infected individual begins exhibiting symptoms, the disease becomes very contagious. Ebola
     virus is transmitted through direct contact with droplets of bodily fluids such as saliva, blood, and vomit. Duncan
     could conceivably have transmitted the disease to others at any time after he began having symptoms,
     presumably some time before his arrival at the hospital in Dallas. Once a hospital realizes a patient like Duncan
     is infected with Ebola virus, the patient is immediately quarantined, and public health officials initiate a back
     trace to identify everyone with whom a patient like Duncan might have interacted during the period in which he
     was showing symptoms.

     Public health officials were able to track down 10 high-risk individuals (family members of Duncan) and 50 low-
     risk individuals to monitor them for signs of infection. None contracted the disease. However, one of the nurses
     charged with Duncan's care did become infected. This, along with Duncan's initial misdiagnosis, made it clear
     that US hospitals needed to provide additional training to medical personnel to prevent a possible Ebola
     outbreak in the US.

    · Compare in vivo and in vitro techniques used to cultivate viruses

At the beginning of this chapter, we described how porcelain Chamberland filters with pores small enough to allow
viruses to pass through were used to discover TMV. Today, porcelain filters have been replaced with membrane
filters and other devices used to isolate and identify viruses.

Isolation of Viruses

Unlike bacteria, many of which can be grown on an artificial nutrient medium, viruses require a living host cell for
replication. Infected host cells (eukaryotic or prokaryotic) can be cultured and grown, and then the growth medium
can be harvested as a source of virus. Virions in the liquid medium can be separated from the host cells by either
centrifugation or filtration. Filters can physically remove anything present in the solution that is larger than the
virions; the viruses can then be collected in the filtrate (see Figure 6.16).

shaped bacterial cells captured on the surface of a membrane filter. Note differences in the comparative size of the membrane pores and

Cultivation of Viruses

Viruses can be grown in vivo (within a whole living organism, plant, or animal) or in vitro (outside a living organism
in cells in an artificial environment. Flat horizontal cell culture flasks (see Figure 6.17(a)) are a common vessel used
for in vitro work. Bacteriophages can be grown in the presence of a dense layer of bacteria (also called a bacterial
lawn) grown in a 0.7 % soft agar in a Petri dish or flat (horizontal) flask (see Figure 6.17(b)). As the phage kills the
bacteria, many plaques are observed among the cloudy bacterial lawn.

     Animal viruses require cells within a host animal or tissue-culture cells derived from an animal. Animal virus
     cultivation is important for 1) identification and diagnosis of pathogenic viruses in clinical specimens, 2) production
     of vaccines, and 3) basic research studies. In vivo host sources can be a developing embryo in an embryonated
     bird's egg (e.g., chicken, turkey) or a whole animal. For example, most of the influenza vaccine manufactured for
     annual flu vaccination programs is cultured in hens' eggs.

     The embryo or host animal serves as an incubator for viral replication (see Figure 6.18). Location within the embryo
     or host animal is important. Many viruses have a tissue tropism, and must therefore be introduced into a specific site
     for growth. Within an embryo, target sites include the amniotic cavity, the chorioallantoic membrane, or the yolk sac.
     Viral infection may damage tissue membranes, producing lesions called pox; disrupt embryonic development; or
     cause the death of the embryo.

     FIGURE 6.18 (a) The cells within chicken eggs are used to culture different types of viruses. (b) Viruses can be replicated in various
     locations within the egg, including the chorioallantoic membrane, the amniotic cavity, and the yolk sac. (credit a: modification of work by
     "Chung Hoang"/YouTube)

     For in vitro studies, various types of cells can be used to support the growth of viruses. A primary cell culture is
     freshly prepared from animal organs or tissues. Cells are extracted from tissues by mechanical scraping or mincing
     to release cells or by an enzymatic method using trypsin or collagenase to break up tissue and release single cells
     into suspension. Because of anchorage-dependence requirements, primary cell cultures require a liquid culture
     medium in a Petri dish or tissue-culture flask so cells have a solid surface such as glass or plastic for attachment
     and growth. Primary cultures usually have a limited life span. When cells in a primary culture undergo mitosis and a
     sufficient density of cells is produced, cells come in contact with other cells. When this cell-to-cell-contact occurs,
     mitosis is triggered to stop. This is called contact inhibition and it prevents the density of the cells from becoming
     too high. To prevent contact inhibition, cells from the primary cell culture must be transferred to another vessel with
     fresh growth medium. This is called a secondary cell culture. Periodically, cell density must be reduced by pouring
     off some cells and adding fresh medium to provide space and nutrients to maintain cell growth. In contrast to
     primary cell cultures, continuous cell lines, usually derived from transformed cells or tumors, are often able to be

a result, continuous cell lines can grow in piles or lumps resembling small tumor growths (see Figure 6.19).

An example of an immortal cell line is the HeLa cell line, which was originally cultivated from tumor cells obtained
from Henrietta Lacks, a patient who died of cervical cancer in 1951. HeLa cells were the first continuous tissue-
culture cell line and were used to establish tissue culture as an important technology for research in cell biology,
virology, and medicine. Prior to the discovery of HeLa cells, scientists were not able to establish tissue cultures with
any reliability or stability. More than six decades later, this cell line is still alive and being used for medical research.

  EYE ON ETHICS

  The Immortal Cell Line of Henrietta Lacks

  In January 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a 30-year-old African American woman from Baltimore, was diagnosed with
  cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We now know her cancer was caused by the human papillomavirus
  (HPV). Cytopathic effects of the virus altered the characteristics of her cells in a process called transformation,
  which gives the cells the ability to divide continuously. This ability, of course, resulted in a cancerous tumor that
  eventually killed Mrs. Lacks in October at age 31. Before her death, samples of her cancerous cells were taken
  without her knowledge or permission. The samples eventually ended up in the possession of Dr. George Gey, a
  biomedical researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Gey was able to grow some of the cells from Lacks's sample,
  creating what is known today as the immortal HeLa cell line. These cells have the ability to live and grow
  indefinitely and, even today, are still widely used in many areas of research.

  According to Lacks's husband, neither Henrietta nor the family gave the hospital permission to collect her tissue
  specimen. Indeed, the family was not aware until 20 years after Lacks's death that her cells were still alive and
238  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     actively being used for commercial and research purposes. Yet HeLa cells have been pivotal in numerous
     research discoveries related to polio, cancer, and AIDS, among other diseases. The cells have also been
     commercialized, although they have never themselves been patented. Despite this, Henrietta Lacks's estate has
     never benefited from the use of the cells, although, in 2013, the Lacks family was given control over the
     publication of the genetic sequence of her cells. In 2023, her family reached a settlement with biotech company
     Thermo Fisher, whom they had sued for knowingly profiting from the cell line without compensating the Lacks
     family.

     This case raises several bioethical issues surrounding patients' informed consent and the right to know. At the
     time Lacks's tissues were taken, there were no laws or guidelines about informed consent. Does that mean she
     was treated fairly at the time? Certainly by today's standards, the answer would be no. Harvesting tissue or
     organs from a dying patient without consent is not only considered unethical but illegal, regardless of whether
     such an act could save other patients' lives. Is it ethical, then, for scientists to continue to use Lacks's tissues for
     research, even though they were obtained illegally by today's standards?

     Ethical or not, Lacks's cells are widely used today for so many applications that it is impossible to list them all. Is
     this a case in which the ends justify the means? Would Lacks be pleased to know about her contribution to
     science and the millions of people who have benefited? Would she want her family to be compensated for the
     commercial products that have been developed using her cells? Or would she feel violated and exploited by the
     researchers who took part of her body without her consent? Because she was never asked, we will never know.

     In 2023, the family of Henrietta Lacks settled a historic lawsuit against Thermo Fischer Scientific
     (https://www.openstax.org/r/22Lackslawsuit).

     Detection of a Virus

     Regardless of the method of cultivation, once a virus has been introduced into a whole host organism, embryo, or
     tissue-culture cell, a sample can be prepared from the infected host, embryo, or cell line for further analysis under a
     brightfield, electron, or fluorescent microscope. Cytopathic effects (CPEs) are distinct observable cell
     abnormalities due to viral infection. CPEs can include loss of adherence to the surface of the container, changes in
     cell shape from flat to round, shrinkage of the nucleus, vacuoles in the cytoplasm, fusion of cytoplasmic membranes
     and the formation of multinucleated syncytia, inclusion bodies in the nucleus or cytoplasm, and complete cell lysis
     (see Figure 6.21).

     Further pathological changes include viral disruption of the host genome and altering normal cells into transformed
     cells, which are the types of cells associated with carcinomas and sarcomas. The type or severity of the CPE
     depends on the type of virus involved. Figure 6.21 lists CPEs for specific viruses.

Hemagglutination Assay
A serological assay is used to detect the presence of certain types of viruses in patient serum. Serum is the straw-
colored liquid fraction of blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed. Serum can be used in a
240  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     direct assay called a hemagglutination assay to detect specific types of viruses in the patient's sample.
     Hemagglutination is the agglutination (clumping) together of erythrocytes (red blood cells). Many viruses produce
     surface proteins or spikes called hemagglutinins that can bind to receptors on the membranes of erythrocytes and
     cause the cells to agglutinate. Hemagglutination is observable without using the microscope, but this method does
     not always differentiate between infectious and noninfectious viral particles, since both can agglutinate
     erythrocytes.

     To identify a specific pathogenic virus using hemagglutination, we must use an indirect approach. Proteins called
     antibodies, generated by the patient's immune system to fight a specific virus, can be used to bind to components
     such as hemagglutinins that are uniquely associated with specific types of viruses. The binding of the antibodies
     with the hemagglutinins found on the virus subsequently prevent erythrocytes from directly interacting with the
     virus. So when erythrocytes are added to the antibody-coated viruses, there is no appearance of agglutination;
     agglutination has been inhibited. We call these types of indirect assays for virus-specific antibodies
     hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays. HAI can be used to detect the presence of antibodies specific to many
     types of viruses that may be causing or have caused an infection in a patient even months or years after infection
     (see Figure 6.22). This assay is described in greater detail in Agglutination Assays.

     FIGURE 6.22 This chart shows the possible outcomes of a hemagglutination test. Row A: Erythrocytes do not bind together and will sink to
     the bottom of the well plate; this becomes visible as a red dot in the center of the well. Row B: Many viruses have hemagglutinins that
     causes agglutination of erythrocytes; the resulting hemagglutination forms a lattice structure that results in red color throughout the well.
     Row C: Virus-specific antibody, the viruses, and the erythrocytes are added to the well plate. The virus-specific antibodies inhibit
     agglutination, as can be seen as a red dot in the bottom of the well. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and

     Nucleic Acid Amplification Test
     Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are used in molecular biology to detect unique nucleic acid sequences of
     viruses in patient samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an NAAT used to detect the presence of viral DNA in a
     patient's tissue or body fluid sample. PCR is a technique that amplifies (i.e., synthesizes many copies) of a viral DNA
     segment of interest. Using PCR, short nucleotide sequences called primers bind to specific sequences of viral DNA,
     enabling identification of the virus.

Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is an NAAT used to detect the presence of RNA viruses. RT-PCR differs from
PCR in that the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to make a cDNA from the small amount of viral RNA in the
specimen. The cDNA can then be amplified by PCR. Both PCR and RT-PCR are used to detect and confirm the
presence of the viral nucleic acid in patient specimens.

  CASE IN POINT

  HPV Scare

  Michelle, a 21-year-old nursing student, came to the university clinic worried that she might have been exposed
  to a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Her sexual partner had recently developed several bumps on the base
  of his penis. He had put off going to the doctor, but Michelle suspects they are genital warts caused by HPV. She
  is especially concerned because she knows that HPV not only causes warts but is a prominent cause of cervical
  cancer. She and her partner always use condoms for contraception, but she is not confident that this precaution
  will protect her from HPV.

  Michelle's physician finds no physical signs of genital warts or any other STDs, but recommends that Michelle
  get a Pap smear along with an HPV test. The Pap smear will screen for abnormal cervical cells and the CPEs
  associated with HPV; the HPV test will test for the presence of the virus. If both tests are negative, Michelle can
  be more assured that she most likely has not become infected with HPV. However, her doctor suggests it might
  be wise for Michelle to get vaccinated against HPV to protect herself from possible future exposure.

      · Why does Michelle's physician order two different tests instead of relying on one or the other?

Enzyme Immunoassay
Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) rely on the ability of antibodies to detect and attach to specific biomolecules called
antigens. The detecting antibody attaches to the target antigen with a high degree of specificity in what might be a
complex mixture of biomolecules. Also included in this type of assay is a colorless enzyme attached to the detecting
antibody. The enzyme acts as a tag on the detecting antibody and can interact with a colorless substrate, leading to
the production of a colored end product. EIAs often rely on layers of antibodies to capture and react with antigens,
all of which are attached to a membrane filter (see Figure 6.23). EIAs for viral antigens are often used as preliminary
screening tests. If the results are positive, further confirmation will require tests with even greater sensitivity, such
as a western blot or an NAAT. EIAs are discussed in more detail in EIAs and ELISAs.
242  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     FIGURE 6.23 Similar to rapid, over-the-counter pregnancy tests, EIAs for viral antigens require a few drops of diluted patient serum or

     internal controls. Antibody conjugate is added to the filter, with the targeted antibody attached to the antigen (in the case of a positive test).

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Part 3

  Along with the RT/PCR analysis, David's saliva was also collected for viral cultivation. In general, no single
  diagnostic test is sufficient for antemortem diagnosis, since the results will depend on the sensitivity of the
  assay, the quantity of virions present at the time of testing, and the timing of the assay, since release of virions in
  the saliva can vary. As it turns out, the result was negative for viral cultivation from the saliva. This is not
  surprising to David's doctor, because one negative result is not an absolute indication of the absence of
  infection. It may be that the number of virions in the saliva is low at the time of sampling. It is not unusual to
  repeat the test at intervals to enhance the chance of detecting higher virus loads.

6.4 Viroids, Virusoids, and Prions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe viroids and their unique characteristics
    · Describe virusoids and their unique characteristics
    · Describe prions and their unique characteristics

Research attempts to discover the causative agents of previously uninvestigated diseases have led to the discovery
of nonliving disease agents quite different from viruses. These include particles consisting only of RNA or only of
protein that, nonetheless, are able to self-propagate at the expense of a host--a key similarity to viruses that allows
them to cause disease conditions. To date, these discoveries include viroids, virusoids, and the proteinaceous
prions.

Viroids

In 1971, Theodor Diener, a pathologist working at the Agriculture Research Service, discovered an acellular particle
that he named a viroid, meaning "virus-like." Viroids consist only of a short strand of circular RNA capable of self-
replication. The first viroid discovered was found to cause potato tuber spindle disease, which causes slower
sprouting and various deformities in potato plants (see Figure 6.24). Like viruses, potato spindle tuber viroids
(PSTVs) take control of the host machinery to replicate their RNA genome. Unlike viruses, viroids do not have a
protein coat to protect their genetic information.

FIGURE 6.24 These potatoes have been infected by the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV), which is typically spread when infected knives
are used to cut healthy potatoes, which are then planted. (credit: Pamela Roberts, University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural
Sciences, USDA ARS)

Viroids can result in devastating losses of commercially important agricultural food crops grown in fields and
orchards. Since the discovery of PSTV, other viroids have been discovered that cause diseases in plants. Tomato
planta macho viroid (TPMVd) infects tomato plants, which causes loss of chlorophyll, disfigured and brittle leaves,
and very small tomatoes, resulting in loss of productivity in this field crop. Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) results
244  6 · Acellular Pathogens

     in lower yields and poorer-quality fruit. ASBVd is the smallest viroid discovered thus far that infects plants. Peach
     latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) can cause necrosis of flower buds and branches, and wounding of ripened fruit, which
     leads to fungal and bacterial growth in the fruit. PLMVd can also cause similar pathological changes in plums,
     nectarines, apricots, and cherries, resulting in decreased productivity in these orchards, as well. Viroids, in general,
     can be dispersed mechanically during crop maintenance or harvesting, vegetative reproduction, and possibly via
     seeds and insects, resulting in a severe drop in food availability and devastating economic consequences.

         · What is the genome of a viroid made of?

     Virusoids

     A second type of pathogenic RNA that can infect commercially important agricultural crops are the virusoids, which
     are subviral particles best described as non-self-replicating ssRNAs. RNA replication of virusoids is similar to that of
     viroids but, unlike viroids, virusoids require that the cell also be infected with a specific "helper" virus. There are
     currently only five described types of virusoids and their associated helper viruses. The helper viruses are all from
     the family of Sobemoviruses. An example of a helper virus is the subterranean clover mottle virus, which has an
     associated virusoid packaged inside the viral capsid. Once the helper virus enters the host cell, the virusoids are
     released and can be found free in plant cell cytoplasm, where they possess ribozyme activity. The helper virus
     undergoes typical viral replication independent of the activity of the virusoid. The virusoid genomes are small, only
     220 to 388 nucleotides long. A virusoid genome does not code for any proteins, but instead serves only to replicate
     virusoid RNA.

     Virusoids belong to a larger group of infectious agents called satellite RNAs, which are similar pathogenic RNAs
     found in animals. Unlike the plant virusoids, satellite RNAs may encode for proteins; however, like plant virusoids,
     satellite RNAs must coinfect with a helper virus to replicate. One satellite RNA that infects humans and that has
     been described by some scientists as a virusoid is the hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which, by some reports, is also
     called hepatitis delta virusoid. Much larger than a plant virusoid, HDV has a circular, ssRNA genome of 1,700
     nucleotides and can direct the biosynthesis of HDV-associated proteins. The HDV helper virus is the hepatitis B virus
     (HBV). Coinfection with HBV and HDV results in more severe pathological changes in the liver during infection, which
     is how HDV was first discovered.

     Prions

     At one time, scientists believed that any infectious particle must contain DNA or RNA. Then, in 1982, Stanley
     Prusiner, a medical doctor studying scrapie (a fatal, degenerative disease in sheep) discovered that the disease was
     caused by proteinaceous infectious particles, or prions. Because proteins are acellular and do not contain DNA or
     RNA, Prusiner's findings were originally met with resistance and skepticism; however, his research was eventually
     validated, and he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997.

     A prion is a misfolded rogue form of a normal protein (PrPc) found in the cell. This rogue prion protein (PrPsc), which
     may be caused by a genetic mutation or occur spontaneously, can be infectious, stimulating other endogenous
     normal proteins to become misfolded, forming plaques (see Figure 6.25). Today, prions are known to cause various
     forms of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in human and animals. TSE is a rare degenerative
     disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. The accumulation of rogue proteins causes the brain tissue to
     become sponge-like, killing brain cells and forming holes in the tissue, leading to brain damage, loss of motor
     coordination, and dementia (see Figure 6.26). Infected individuals are mentally impaired and become unable to
     move or speak. There is no cure, and the disease progresses rapidly, eventually leading to death within a few
     months or years.

FIGURE 6.25 Endogenous normal prion protein (PrPc) is converted into the disease-causing form (PrPsc) when it encounters this variant
form of the protein. PrPsc may arise spontaneously in brain tissue, especially if a mutant form of the protein is present, or it may originate
from misfolded prions consumed in food that eventually find their way into brain tissue. (credit b: modification of work by USDA)

TSEs in humans include kuru, fatal familial insomnia, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, and Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease (see Figure 6.26). TSEs in animals include mad cow disease, scrapie (in sheep and goats), and
chronic wasting disease (in elk and deer). TSEs can be transmitted between animals and from animals to humans by
eating contaminated meat or animal feed. Transmission between humans can occur through heredity (as is often the
case with GSS and CJD) or by contact with contaminated tissue, as might occur during a blood transfusion or organ
transplant. There is no evidence for transmission via casual contact with an infected person. Table 6.3 lists TSEs
that affect humans and their modes of transmission.

     Prions are extremely difficult to destroy because they are resistant to heat, chemicals, and radiation. Even standard
     sterilization procedures do not ensure the destruction of these particles. Currently, there is no treatment or cure for
     TSE disease, and contaminated meats or infected animals must be handled according to federal guidelines to
     prevent transmission.

       Resolution

       A few days later, David's doctor receives the results of the immunofluorescence test on his skin sample. The test
       is negative for rabies antigen. A second viral antigen test on his saliva sample also comes back negative. Despite
       these results, the doctor decides to continue David's current course of treatment. Given the positive RT-PCR
       test, it is best not to rule out a possible rabies infection.
       Near the site of the bite, David receives an injection of rabies immunoglobulin, which attaches to and inactivates
       any rabies virus that may be present in his tissues. Over the next 14 days, he receives a series of four rabies-
       specific vaccinations in the arm. These vaccines activate David's immune response and help his body recognize
       and fight the virus. Thankfully, with treatment, David symptoms improve and he makes a full recovery.

Not all rabies cases have such a fortunate outcome. In fact, rabies is usually fatal once the patient starts to
exhibit symptoms, and postbite treatments are mainly palliative (i.e., sedation and pain management).

Microbial Biochemistry

FIGURE 7.1 Scientist Stanley Miller and Harold Urey demonstrated that organic compounds may have originated naturally from inorganic
matter. The Miller-Urey experiment illustrated here simulated the effects of lightning on chemical compounds found in the earth's early
atmosphere. The resulting reactions yielded amino acids, the chemical building blocks of proteins. (credit: modification of work by Courtney

7.5 Using Biochemistry to Identify Microorganisms
INTRODUCTION The earth is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old, but for the first 2 billion years, the atmosphere
lacked oxygen, without which the earth could not support life as we know it. One hypothesis about how life emerged
on earth involves the concept of a "primordial soup." This idea proposes that life began in a body of water when
metals and gases from the atmosphere combined with a source of energy, such as lightning or ultraviolet light, to
form the carbon compounds that are the chemical building blocks of life. In 1952, Stanley Miller (1930-2007), a
graduate student at the University of Chicago, and his professor Harold Urey (1893-1981), set out to confirm this
hypothesis in a now-famous experiment. Miller and Urey combined what they believed to be the major components
of the earth's early atmosphere--water (H2O), methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and ammonia (NH3)--and sealed them
in a sterile flask. Next, they heated the flask to produce water vapor and passed electric sparks through the mixture
to mimic lightning in the atmosphere (Figure 7.1). When they analyzed the contents of the flask a week later, they
found amino acids, the structural units of proteins--molecules essential to the function of all organisms.

       Part 1

       Penny is a 16-year-old student who visited her doctor, complaining about an itchy skin rash. She had a history of
       allergic episodes. The doctor looked at her sun-tanned skin and asked her if she switched to a different
       sunscreen. She said she had, so the doctor diagnosed an allergic eczema. The symptoms were mild so the
       doctor told Penny to avoid using the sunscreen that caused the reaction and prescribed an over-the-counter
       moisturizing cream to keep her skin hydrated and to help with itching.

     Biochemistry is the discipline that studies the chemistry of life, and its objective is to explain form and function
     based on chemical principles. Organic chemistry is the discipline devoted to the study of carbon-based chemistry,
     which is the foundation for the study of biomolecules and the discipline of biochemistry. Both biochemistry and
     organic chemistry are based on the concepts of general chemistry, some of which are presented in Appendix A.

     Elements in Living Cells

     The most abundant element in cells is hydrogen (H), followed by carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorous
     (P), and sulfur (S). We call these elements macronutrients, and they account for about 99% of the dry weight of
     cells. Some elements, such as sodium (Na), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), calcium (Ca),
     molybdenum (Mo), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), or vanadium (V), are required by some cells in very
     small amounts and are called micronutrients or trace elements. All of these elements are essential to the function
     of many biochemical reactions, and, therefore, are essential to life.

     The four most abundant elements in living matter (C, N, O, and H) have low atomic numbers and are thus light
     elements capable of forming strong bonds with other atoms to produce molecules (Figure 7.2). Carbon forms four
     chemical bonds, whereas nitrogen forms three, oxygen forms two, and hydrogen forms one. When bonded together
     within molecules, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen often have one or more "lone pairs" of electrons that play important
     roles in determining many of the molecules' physical and chemical properties (see Appendix A). These traits in
     combination permit the formation of a vast number of diverse molecular species necessary to form the structures
     and enable the functions of living organisms.

FIGURE 7.2 Some common molecules include carbon dioxide, ammonia, and oxygen, which consist of combinations of oxygen atoms (red
spheres), carbon atoms (gray spheres), hydrogen atoms (white spheres), or nitrogen atoms (blue spheres).

Living organisms contain inorganic compounds (mainly water and salts; see Appendix A) and organic molecules.
Organic molecules contain carbon; inorganic compounds do not. Carbon oxides and carbonates are exceptions; they
contain carbon but are considered inorganic because they do not contain hydrogen. The atoms of an organic
molecule are typically organized around chains of carbon atoms.

Inorganic compounds make up 1%-1.5% of the dry weight of living cells. They are small, simple compounds that
play important roles in the cell, although they do not form cell structures. Most of the carbon found in organic
molecules originates from inorganic carbon sources such as carbon dioxide captured via carbon fixation by
microorganisms.

Organic molecules in organisms are generally larger and more complex than inorganic molecules. Their carbon
skeletons are held together by covalent bonds. They form the cells of an organism and perform the chemical
reactions that facilitate life. All of these molecules, called biomolecules because they are part of living matter,
contain carbon, which is the building block of life. Carbon is a very unique element in that it has four valence
electrons in its outer orbitals and can form four single covalent bonds with up to four other atoms at the same time
(see Appendix A). These atoms are usually oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, and carbon itself; the
simplest organic compound is methane, in which carbon binds only to hydrogen (Figure 7.3).

As a result of carbon's unique combination of size and bonding properties, carbon atoms can bind together in large
numbers, thus producing a chain or carbon skeleton. The carbon skeleton of organic molecules can be straight,
branched, or ring shaped (cyclic). Organic molecules are built on chains of carbon atoms of varying lengths; most are
typically very long, which allows for a huge number and variety of compounds. No other element has the ability to
form so many different molecules of so many different sizes and shapes.

      FIGURE 7.3 A carbon atom can bond with up to four other atoms. The simplest organic molecule is methane (CH4), depicted here.

Molecules with the same atomic makeup but different structural arrangement of atoms are called isomers. The
concept of isomerism is very important in chemistry because the structure of a molecule is always directly related to
its function. Slight changes in the structural arrangements of atoms in a molecule may lead to very different
256  7 · Microbial Biochemistry

     properties. Chemists represent molecules by their structural formula, which is a graphic representation of the
     molecular structure, showing how the atoms are arranged. Compounds that have identical molecular formulas but
     differ in the bonding sequence of the atoms are called structural isomers. The monosaccharides glucose,
     galactose, and fructose all have the same molecular formula, C6H12O6, but we can see from Figure 7.4 that the
     atoms are bonded together differently.

     FIGURE 7.4 Glucose, galactose, and fructose have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6), but these structural isomers differ in their
     physical and chemical properties.

     Isomers that differ in the spatial arrangements of atoms are called stereoisomers; one unique type is enantiomers.
     The properties of enantiomers were originally discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1848 while using a microscope to
     analyze crystallized fermentation products of wine. Enantiomers are molecules that have the characteristic of
     chirality, in which their structures are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other. Chirality is an important
     characteristic in many biologically important molecules, as illustrated by the examples of structural differences in
     the enantiomeric forms of the monosaccharide glucose or the amino acid alanine (Figure 7.5).
     Many organisms are only able to use one enantiomeric form of certain types of molecules as nutrients and as
     building blocks to make structures within a cell. Some enantiomeric forms of amino acids have distinctly different
     tastes and smells when consumed as food. For example, L-aspartame, commonly called aspartame, tastes sweet,
     whereas D-aspartame is tasteless. Drug enantiomers can have very different pharmacologic affects. For example,
     the compound methorphan exists as two enantiomers, one of which acts as an antitussive (dextromethorphan, a
     cough suppressant), whereas the other acts as an analgesic (levomethorphan, a drug similar in effect to codeine).

other. (a) D-glucose and L-glucose are monosaccharides that are enantiomers. (b) The enantiomers D-alanine and L-alanine are
enantiomers found in bacterial cell walls and human cells, respectively.

Enantiomers are also called optical isomers because they can rotate the plane of polarized light. Some of the
crystals Pasteur observed from wine fermentation rotated light clockwise whereas others rotated the light
counterclockwise. Today, we denote enantiomers that rotate polarized light clockwise (+) as d forms, and the mirror
image of the same molecule that rotates polarized light counterclockwise (-) as the l form. The d and l labels are
derived from the Latin words dexter (on the right) and laevus (on the left), respectively. These two different optical
isomers often have very different biological properties and activities. Certain species of molds, yeast, and bacteria,
such as Rhizopus, Yarrowia, and Lactobacillus spp., respectively, can only metabolize one type of optical isomer; the
opposite isomer is not suitable as a source of nutrients. Another important reason to be aware of optical isomers is
the therapeutic use of these types of chemicals for drug treatment, because some microorganisms can only be
affected by one specific optical isomer.

Biologically Significant Functional Groups

In addition to containing carbon atoms, biomolecules also contain functional groups--groups of atoms within
molecules that are categorized by their specific chemical composition and the chemical reactions they perform,
regardless of the molecule in which the group is found. Some of the most common functional groups are listed in
Figure 7.6. In the formulas, the symbol R stands for "residue" and represents the remainder of the molecule. R
might symbolize just a single hydrogen atom or it may represent a group of many atoms. Notice that some functional
groups are relatively simple, consisting of just one or two atoms, while some comprise two of these simpler
functional groups. For example, a carbonyl group is a functional group composed of a carbon atom double bonded to
an oxygen atom: C=O. It is present in several classes of organic compounds as part of larger functional groups such
as ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and amides. In ketones, the carbonyl is present as an internal group,
whereas in aldehydes it is a terminal group.

     relevant macromolecules are formed by linking together a great number of identical, or very similar, smaller organic
     molecules. The smaller molecules act as building blocks and are called monomers, and the macromolecules that
     result from their linkage are called polymers. Cells and cell structures include four main groups of carbon-

containing macromolecules: polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The first three groups of molecules
will be studied throughout this chapter. The biochemistry of nucleic acids will be discussed in Biochemistry of the
Genome.

Of the many possible ways that monomers may be combined to yield polymers, one common approach encountered
in the formation of biological macromolecules is dehydration synthesis. In this chemical reaction, monomer
molecules bind end to end in a process that results in the formation of water molecules as a byproduct:

Figure 7.7 shows dehydration synthesis of glucose binding together to form maltose and a water molecule. Table 7.1
summarizes macromolecules and some of their functions.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Give examples of monosaccharides and polysaccharides
    · Describe the function of monosaccharides and polysaccharides within a cell

The most abundant biomolecules on earth are carbohydrates. From a chemical viewpoint, carbohydrates are
primarily a combination of carbon and water, and many of them have the empirical formula (CH2O)n, where n is the
number of repeated units. This view represents these molecules simply as "hydrated" carbon atom chains in which
water molecules attach to each carbon atom, leading to the term "carbohydrates." Although all carbohydrates
contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, there are some that also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur.
Carbohydrates have myriad different functions. They are abundant in terrestrial ecosystems, many forms of which
we use as food sources. These molecules are also vital parts of macromolecular structures that store and transmit
260  7 · Microbial Biochemistry

     genetic information (i.e., DNA and RNA). They are the basis of biological polymers that impart strength to various
     structural components of organisms (e.g., cellulose and chitin), and they are the primary source of energy storage in
     the form of starch and glycogen.

     Monosaccharides: The Sweet Ones

     In biochemistry, carbohydrates are often called saccharides, from the Greek sakcharon, meaning sugar, although
     not all the saccharides are sweet. The simplest carbohydrates are called monosaccharides, or simple sugars. They
     are the building blocks (monomers) for the synthesis of polymers or complex carbohydrates, as will be discussed
     further in this section. Monosaccharides are classified based on the number of carbons in the molecule. General
     categories are identified using a prefix that indicates the number of carbons and the suffix -ose, which indicates a
     saccharide; for example, triose (three carbons), tetrose (four carbons), pentose (five carbons), and hexose (six
     carbons) (Figure 7.8). The hexose D-glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in nature. Other very common
     and abundant hexose monosaccharides are galactose, used to make the disaccharide milk sugar lactose, and the
     fruit sugar fructose.

         FIGURE 7.8 Monosaccharides are classified based on the position of the carbonyl group and the number of carbons in the backbone.

     Monosaccharides of four or more carbon atoms are typically more stable when they adopt cyclic, or ring, structures.
     These ring structures result from a chemical reaction between functional groups on opposite ends of the sugar's
     flexible carbon chain, namely the carbonyl group and a relatively distant hydroxyl group. Glucose, for example,
     forms a six-membered ring (Figure 7.9).

    · Why do monosaccharides form ring structures?

Disaccharides

Two monosaccharide molecules may chemically bond to form a disaccharide. The name given to the covalent bond
between the two monosaccharides is a glycosidic bond. Glycosidic bonds form between hydroxyl groups of the two
saccharide molecules, an example of the dehydration synthesis described in the previous section of this chapter:

Common disaccharides are the grain sugar maltose, made of two glucose molecules; the milk sugar lactose, made
of a galactose and a glucose molecule; and the table sugar sucrose, made of a glucose and a fructose molecule
(Figure 7.10).

FIGURE 7.10 Common disaccharides include maltose, lactose, and sucrose.
262  7 · Microbial Biochemistry

     Polysaccharides

     Polysaccharides, also called glycans, are large polymers composed of hundreds of monosaccharide monomers.
     Unlike mono- and disaccharides, polysaccharides are not sweet and, in general, they are not soluble in water. Like
     disaccharides, the monomeric units of polysaccharides are linked together by glycosidic bonds.

     Polysaccharides are very diverse in their structure. Three of the most biologically important
     polysaccharides--starch, glycogen, and cellulose--are all composed of repetitive glucose units, although they differ
     in their structure (Figure 7.11). Cellulose consists of a linear chain of glucose molecules and is a common structural
     component of cell walls in plants and other organisms. Glycogen and starch are branched polymers; glycogen is the
     primary energy-storage molecule in animals and bacteria, whereas plants primarily store energy in starch. The
     orientation of the glycosidic linkages in these three polymers is different as well and, as a consequence, linear and
     branched macromolecules have different properties.

     Modified glucose molecules can be fundamental components of other structural polysaccharides. Examples of
     these types of structural polysaccharides are N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) and N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM) found
     in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Polymers of NAG form chitin, which is found in fungal cell walls and in the
     exoskeleton of insects.

    · Describe the chemical composition of lipids
    · Describe the unique characteristics and diverse structures of lipids
    · Compare and contrast triacylglycerides (triglycerides) and phospholipids.
    · Describe how phospholipids are used to construct biological membranes.

Although they are composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen, lipid molecules may also contain oxygen, nitrogen,
sulfur, and phosphorous. Lipids serve numerous and diverse purposes in the structure and functions of organisms.
They can be a source of nutrients, a storage form for carbon, energy-storage molecules, or structural components of
membranes and hormones. Lipids comprise a broad class of many chemically distinct compounds, the most
common of which are discussed in this section.

Fatty Acids and Triacylglycerides

The fatty acids are lipids that contain long-chain hydrocarbons terminated with a carboxylic acid functional group.
Because the long hydrocarbon chain, fatty acids are hydrophobic ("water fearing") or nonpolar. Fatty acids with
hydrocarbon chains that contain only single bonds are called saturated fatty acids because they have the greatest
number of hydrogen atoms possible and are, therefore, "saturated" with hydrogen. Fatty acids with hydrocarbon
chains containing at least one double bond are called unsaturated fatty acids because they have fewer hydrogen
atoms. Saturated fatty acids have a straight, flexible carbon backbone, whereas unsaturated fatty acids have "kinks"
in their carbon skeleton because each double bond causes a rigid bend of the carbon skeleton. These differences in
saturated versus unsaturated fatty acid structure result in different properties for the corresponding lipids in which
the fatty acids are incorporated. For example, lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solids at room temperature,
whereas lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquids.

A triacylglycerol, or triglyceride, is formed when three fatty acids are chemically linked to a glycerol molecule
(Figure 7.12). Triglycerides are the primary components of adipose tissue (body fat), and are major constituents of
sebum (skin oils). They play an important metabolic role, serving as efficient energy-storage molecules that can
provide more than double the caloric content of both carbohydrates and proteins.

    · Explain why fatty acids with hydrocarbon chains that contain only single bonds are called saturated fatty
        acids.

Phospholipids and Biological Membranes

Triglycerides are classified as simple lipids because they are formed from just two types of compounds: glycerol and
fatty acids. In contrast, complex lipids contain at least one additional component, for example, a phosphate group
(phospholipids) or a carbohydrate moiety (glycolipids). Figure 7.13 depicts a typical phospholipid composed of two
264  7 · Microbial Biochemistry

     fatty acids linked to glycerol (a diglyceride). The two fatty acid carbon chains may be both saturated, both
     unsaturated, or one of each. Instead of another fatty acid molecule (as for triglycerides), the third binding position
     on the glycerol molecule is occupied by a modified phosphate group.

     FIGURE 7.13 This illustration shows a phospholipid with two different fatty acids, one saturated and one unsaturated, bonded to the
     glycerol molecule. The unsaturated fatty acid has a slight kink in its structure due to the double bond.

     The molecular structure of lipids results in unique behavior in aqueous environments. Figure 7.12 depicts the
     structure of a triglyceride. Because all three substituents on the glycerol backbone are long hydrocarbon chains,
     these compounds are nonpolar and not significantly attracted to polar water molecules--they are hydrophobic.
     Conversely, phospholipids such as the one shown in Figure 7.13 have a negatively charged phosphate group.
     Because the phosphate is charged, it is capable of strong attraction to water molecules and thus is hydrophilic, or
     "water loving." The hydrophilic portion of the phospholipid is often referred to as a polar "head," and the long
     hydrocarbon chains as nonpolar "tails." A molecule presenting a hydrophobic portion and a hydrophilic moiety is
     said to be amphipathic. Notice the "R" designation within the hydrophilic head depicted in Figure 7.13, indicating
     that a polar head group can be more complex than a simple phosphate moiety. Glycolipids are examples in which
     carbohydrates are bonded to the lipids' head groups.

     The amphipathic nature of phospholipids enables them to form uniquely functional structures in aqueous
     environments. As mentioned, the polar heads of these molecules are strongly attracted to water molecules, and the
     nonpolar tails are not. Because of their considerable lengths, these tails are, in fact, strongly attracted to one
     another. As a result, energetically stable, large-scale assemblies of phospholipid molecules are formed in which the
     hydrophobic tails congregate within enclosed regions, shielded from contact with water by the polar heads (Figure
     7.14). The simplest of these structures are micelles, spherical assemblies containing a hydrophobic interior of
     phospholipid tails and an outer surface of polar head groups. Larger and more complex structures are created from
     lipid-bilayer sheets, or unit membranes, which are large, two-dimensional assemblies of phospholipids
     congregated tail to tail. The cell membranes of nearly all organisms are made from lipid-bilayer sheets, as are the
     membranes of many intracellular components. These sheets may also form lipid-bilayer spheres that are the
     structural basis of vesicles and liposomes, subcellular components that play a role in numerous physiological
     functions.

Isoprenoids and Sterols

The isoprenoids are branched lipids, also referred to as terpenoids, that are formed by chemical modifications of
the isoprene molecule (Figure 7.15). These lipids play a wide variety of physiological roles in plants and animals,
with many technological uses as pharmaceuticals (capsaicin), pigments (e.g., orange beta carotene, xanthophylls),
and fragrances (e.g., menthol, camphor, limonene [lemon fragrance], and pinene [pine fragrance]). Long-chain
isoprenoids are also found in hydrophobic oils and waxes. Waxes are typically water resistant and hard at room
temperature, but they soften when heated and liquefy if warmed adequately. In humans, the main wax production
occurs within the sebaceous glands of hair follicles in the skin, resulting in a secreted material called sebum, which
consists mainly of triacylglycerol, wax esters, and the hydrocarbon squalene. There are many bacteria in the
microbiota on the skin that feed on these lipids. One of the most prominent bacteria that feed on lipids is
Propionibacterium acnes, which uses the skin's lipids to generate short-chain fatty acids and is involved in the
production of acne.

                           FIGURE 7.15 Five-carbon isoprene molecules are chemically modified in various ways to yield isoprenoids.

     Another type of lipids are steroids, complex, ringed structures that are found in cell membranes; some function as
     hormones. The most common types of steroids are sterols, which are steroids containing an OH group. These are
     mainly hydrophobic molecules, but also have hydrophilic hydroxyl groups. The most common sterol found in animal
     tissues is cholesterol. Its structure consists of four rings with a double bond in one of the rings, and a hydroxyl group
     at the sterol-defining position. The function of cholesterol is to strengthen cell membranes in eukaryotes and in
     bacteria without cell walls, such as Mycoplasma. Prokaryotes generally do not produce cholesterol, although
     bacteria produce similar compounds called hopanoids, which are also multiringed structures that strengthen
     bacterial membranes (Figure 7.16). Fungi and some protozoa produce a similar compound called ergosterol, which
     strengthens the cell membranes of these organisms.

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Part 2

  The moisturizing cream prescribed by Penny's doctor was a topical corticosteroid cream containing
  hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, a corticosteroid hormone produced in the adrenal
  glands, from cholesterol. When applied directly to the skin, it can reduce inflammation and temporarily relieve
  minor skin irritations, itching, and rashes by reducing the secretion of histamine, a compound produced by cells
  of the immune system in response to the presence of pathogens or other foreign substances. Because histamine
  triggers the body's inflammatory response, the ability of hydrocortisone to reduce the local production of
  histamine in the skin effectively suppresses the immune system and helps limit inflammation and accompanying
  symptoms such as pruritus (itching) and rashes.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    · Describe the fundamental structure of an amino acid
    · Describe the chemical structures of proteins
    · Summarize the unique characteristics of proteins

At the beginning of this chapter, a famous experiment was described in which scientists synthesized amino acids
under conditions simulating those present on earth long before the evolution of life as we know it. These
compounds are capable of bonding together in essentially any number, yielding molecules of essentially any size
that possess a wide array of physical and chemical properties and perform numerous functions vital to all
organisms. The molecules derived from amino acids can function as structural components of cells and subcellular
entities, as sources of nutrients, as atom- and energy-storage reservoirs, and as functional species such as
hormones, enzymes, receptors, and transport molecules.

Amino Acids and Peptide Bonds

An amino acid is an organic molecule in which a hydrogen atom, a carboxyl group (-COOH), and an amino group
(-NH2) are all bonded to the same carbon atom, the so-called  carbon. The fourth group bonded to the  carbon
varies among the different amino acids and is called a residue or a side chain, represented in structural formulas by
the letter R. A residue is a monomer that results when two or more amino acids combine and remove water
molecules. The primary structure of a protein, a peptide chain, is made of amino acid residues. The unique
characteristics of the functional groups and R groups allow these components of the amino acids to form hydrogen,
ionic, and disulfide bonds, along with polar/nonpolar interactions needed to form secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary protein structures. These groups are composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and
sulfur, in the form of hydrocarbons, acids, amides, alcohols, and amines. A few examples illustrating these
possibilities are provided in Figure 7.17.

     Amino acids may chemically bond together by reaction of the carboxylic acid group of one molecule with the amine
     group of another. This reaction forms a peptide bond and a water molecule and is another example of dehydration
     synthesis (Figure 7.18). Molecules formed by chemically linking relatively modest numbers of amino acids
     (approximately 50 or fewer) are called peptides, and prefixes are often used to specify these numbers: dipeptides
     (two amino acids), tripeptides (three amino acids), and so forth. More generally, the approximate number of amino
     acids is designated: oligopeptides are formed by joining up to approximately 20 amino acids, whereas
     polypeptides are synthesized from up to approximately 50 amino acids. When the number of amino acids linked
     together becomes very large, or when multiple polypeptides are used as building subunits, the macromolecules that
     result are called proteins. The continuously variable length (the number of monomers) of these biopolymers, along
     with the variety of possible R groups on each amino acid, allows for a nearly unlimited diversity in the types of
     proteins that may be formed.

     FIGURE 7.18 Peptide bond formation is a dehydration synthesis reaction. The carboxyl group of the first amino acid (alanine) is linked to

Cycles), soil microorganisms collectively known as rhizobia symbiotically interact with roots of legume plants such
as soybeans, peanuts, or beans to form a novel structure called a nodule on the plant roots. The plant then produces
a carrier protein called leghemoglobin, a protein that carries nitrogen or oxygen. Leghemoglobin binds with a very
high affinity to its substrate oxygen at a specific region of the protein where the shape and amino acid sequence are
appropriate (the active site). If the shape or chemical environment of the active site is altered, even slightly, the
substrate may not be able to bind as strongly, or it may not bind at all. Thus, for the protein to be fully active, it must
have the appropriate shape for its function.

Protein structure is categorized in terms of four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary
structure is simply the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. Figure 7.19 depicts the
primary structure of a protein.

The chain of amino acids that defines a protein's primary structure is not rigid, but instead is flexible because of the
nature of the bonds that hold the amino acids together. When the chain is sufficiently long, hydrogen bonding may
occur between amine and carbonyl functional groups within the peptide backbone (excluding the R side group),
resulting in localized folding of the polypeptide chain into helices and sheets. These shapes constitute a protein's
secondary structure. The most common secondary structures are the -helix and -pleated sheet. In the -helix
structure, the helix is held by hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom in a carbonyl group of one amino acid and
the hydrogen atom of the amino group that is just four amino acid units farther along the chain. In the -pleated
sheet, the pleats are formed by similar hydrogen bonds between continuous sequences of carbonyl and amino
groups that are further separated on the backbone of the polypeptide chain (Figure 7.20).

The next level of protein organization is the tertiary structure, which is the large-scale three-dimensional shape of a
single polypeptide chain. Tertiary structure is determined by interactions between amino acid residues that are far
apart in the chain. A variety of interactions give rise to protein tertiary structure, such as disulfide bridges, which
are bonds between the sulfhydryl (-SH) functional groups on amino acid side groups; hydrogen bonds; ionic bonds;
and hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar side chains. All these interactions, weak and strong, combine to
determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein and its function (Figure 7.21).

The process by which a polypeptide chain assumes a large-scale, three-dimensional shape is called protein folding.
Folded proteins that are fully functional in their normal biological role are said to possess a native structure. When
a protein loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional. These unfolded proteins are denatured.
Denaturation implies the loss of the secondary structure and tertiary structure (and, if present, the quaternary
structure) without the loss of the primary structure.

Some proteins are assemblies of several separate polypeptides, also known as protein subunits. These proteins
function adequately only when all subunits are present and appropriately configured. The interactions that hold
these subunits together constitute the quaternary structure of the protein. The overall quaternary structure is
stabilized by relatively weak interactions. Hemoglobin, for example, has a quaternary structure of four globular
protein subunits: two  and two  polypeptides, each one containing an iron-based heme (Figure 7.22).

Another important class of proteins is the conjugated proteins that have a nonprotein portion. If the conjugated
protein has a carbohydrate attached, it is called a glycoprotein. If it has a lipid attached, it is called a lipoprotein.
These proteins are important components of membranes. Figure 7.23 summarizes the four levels of protein
structure.

     Primary Structure, Dysfunctional Proteins, and Cystic Fibrosis

     Proteins associated with biological membranes are classified as extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic proteins, also called
     peripheral proteins, are loosely associated with one side of the membrane. Intrinsic proteins, or integral proteins,
     are embedded in the membrane and often function as part of transport systems as transmembrane proteins. Cystic
     fibrosis (CF) is a human genetic disorder caused by a change in the transmembrane protein. It affects mostly the
     lungs but may also affect the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. CF is caused by a loss of the amino acid
     phenylalanine in a cystic fibrosis transmembrane protein (CFTR). The loss of one amino acid changes the primary
     structure of a protein that normally helps transport salt and water in and out of cells (Figure 7.24).
     The change in the primary structure prevents the protein from functioning properly, which causes the body to
     produce unusually thick mucus that clogs the lungs and leads to the accumulation of sticky mucus. The mucus
     obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down food and absorb vital
     nutrients.
     In the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis, the altered mucus provides an environment where bacteria can thrive.
     This colonization leads to the formation of biofilms in the small airways of the lungs. The most common pathogens
     found in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis are Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Figure 7.25) and Burkholderia
     cepacia. Pseudomonas differentiates within the biofilm in the lung and forms large colonies, called "mucoid"
     Pseudomonas. The colonies have a unique pigmentation that shows up in laboratory tests (Figure 7.25) and
     provides physicians with the first clue that the patient has CF (such colonies are rare in healthy individuals).

7.5 Using Biochemistry to Identify Microorganisms

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe examples of biosynthesis products within a cell that can be detected to identify bacteria
Accurate identification of bacterial isolates is essential in a clinical microbiology laboratory because the results
often inform decisions about treatment that directly affect patient outcomes. For example, cases of food poisoning
require accurate identification of the causative agent so that physicians can prescribe appropriate treatment.
274  7 · Microbial Biochemistry

     Likewise, it is important to accurately identify the causative pathogen during an outbreak of disease so that
     appropriate strategies can be employed to contain the epidemic.

     There are many ways to detect, characterize, and identify microorganisms. Some methods rely on phenotypic
     biochemical characteristics, while others use genotypic identification. The biochemical characteristics of a
     bacterium provide many traits that are useful for classification and identification. Analyzing the nutritional and
     metabolic capabilities of the bacterial isolate is a common approach for determining the genus and the species of
     the bacterium. Some of the most important metabolic pathways that bacteria use to survive will be discussed in
     Microbial Metabolism. In this section, we will discuss a few methods that use biochemical characteristics to identify
     microorganisms.

     Some microorganisms store certain compounds as granules within their cytoplasm, and the contents of these
     granules can be used for identification purposes. For example, poly--hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a carbon- and
     energy-storage compound found in some nonfluorescent bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Different species
     within this genus can be classified by the presence or the absence of PHB and fluorescent pigments. The human
     pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae are two examples of fluorescent Pseudomonas species
     that do not accumulate PHB granules.

     Other systems rely on biochemical characteristics to identify microorganisms by their biochemical reactions, such
     as carbon utilization and other metabolic tests. In small laboratory settings or in teaching laboratories, those assays
     are carried out using a limited number of test tubes. However, more modern systems, such as the one developed by
     Biolog, Inc., are based on panels of biochemical reactions performed simultaneously and analyzed by software.
     Biolog's system identifies cells based on their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals and on their physiological
     properties, including pH and chemical sensitivity. It uses all major classes of biochemicals in its analysis.
     Identifications can be performed manually or with the semi- or fully automated instruments.

     Another automated system identifies microorganisms by determining the specimen's mass spectrum and then
     comparing it to a database that contains known mass spectra for thousands of microorganisms. This method is
     based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and uses
     disposable MALDI plates on which the microorganism is mixed with a specialized matrix reagent (Figure 7.26). The
     sample/reagent mixture is irradiated with a high-intensity pulsed ultraviolet laser, resulting in the ejection of
     gaseous ions generated from the various chemical constituents of the microorganism. These gaseous ions are
     collected and accelerated through the mass spectrometer, with ions traveling at a velocity determined by their
     mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), thus, reaching the detector at different times. A plot of detector signal versus m/z yields
     a mass spectrum for the organism that is uniquely related to its biochemical composition. Comparison of the mass
     spectrum to a library of reference spectra obtained from identical analyses of known microorganisms permits
     identification of the unknown microbe.

     FIGURE 7.26 MALDI-TOF methods are now routinely used for diagnostic procedures in clinical microbiology laboratories. This technology is
     able to rapidly identify some microorganisms that cannot be readily identified by more traditional methods. (credit "MALDI plate photo":

     Microbes can also be identified by measuring their unique lipid profiles. As we have learned, fatty acids of lipids can
     vary in chain length, presence or absence of double bonds, and number of double bonds, hydroxyl groups, branches,
     and rings. To identify a microbe by its lipid composition, the fatty acids present in their membranes are analyzed. A
     common biochemical analysis used for this purpose is a technique used in clinical, public health, and food

laboratories. It relies on detecting unique differences in fatty acids and is called fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
analysis. In a FAME analysis, fatty acids are extracted from the membranes of microorganisms, chemically altered
to form volatile methyl esters, and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The resulting GC chromatogram is
compared with reference chromatograms in a database containing data for thousands of bacterial isolates to
identify the unknown microorganism (Figure 7.27).

FIGURE 7.27 Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis in bacterial identification results in a chromatogram unique to each bacterium. Each
peak in the gas chromatogram corresponds to a particular fatty acid methyl ester and its height is proportional to the amount present in the
cell. (credit "culture": modification of work by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit "graph": modification of work by Zhang
P. and Liu P.)

A related method for microorganism identification is called phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) analysis.
Membranes are mostly composed of phospholipids, which can be saponified (hydrolyzed with alkali) to release the
fatty acids. The resulting fatty acid mixture is then subjected to FAME analysis, and the measured lipid profiles can
be compared with those of known microorganisms to identify the unknown microorganism.

Bacterial identification can also be based on the proteins produced under specific growth conditions within the
human body. These types of identification procedures are called proteomic analysis. To perform proteomic
analysis, proteins from the pathogen are first separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the
collected fractions are then digested to yield smaller peptide fragments. These peptides are identified by mass
spectrometry and compared with those of known microorganisms to identify the unknown microorganism in the
original specimen.

Microorganisms can also be identified by the carbohydrates attached to proteins (glycoproteins) in the plasma
membrane or cell wall. Antibodies and other carbohydrate-binding proteins can attach to specific carbohydrates on
cell surfaces, causing the cells to clump together. Serological tests (e.g., the Lancefield groups tests, which are used
for identification of Streptococcus species) are performed to detect the unique carbohydrates located on the surface
of the cell.

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Resolution

  Penny stopped using her new sunscreen and applied the corticosteroid cream to her rash as directed. However,
  after several days, her rash had not improved and actually seemed to be getting worse. She made a follow-up
  appointment with her doctor, who observed a bumpy red rash and pus-filled blisters around hair follicles (Figure
  7.28). The rash was especially concentrated in areas that would have been covered by a swimsuit. After some
  questioning, Penny told the physician that she had recently attended a pool party and spent some time in a hot
  tub. In light of this new information, the doctor suspected a case of hot tub rash, an infection frequently caused
  by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that can thrive in hot tubs and swimming
  pools, especially when the water is not sufficiently chlorinated. P. aeruginosa is the same bacterium that is
  associated with infections in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis.

  The doctor collected a specimen from Penny's rash to be sent to the clinical microbiology lab. Confirmatory tests
276  7 · Microbial Biochemistry

     were carried out to distinguish P. aeruginosa from enteric pathogens that can also be present in pool and hot-tub
     water. The test included the production of the blue-green pigment pyocyanin on cetrimide agar and growth at 42
     °C. Cetrimide is a selective agent that inhibits the growth of other species of microbial flora and also enhances
     the production of P. aeruginosa pigments pyocyanin and fluorescein, which are a characteristic blue-green and
     yellow-green, respectively.

     Tests confirmed the presence of P. aeruginosa in Penny's skin sample, but the doctor decided not to prescribe
     an antibiotic. Even though P. aeruginosa is a bacterium, Pseudomonas species are generally resistant to many
     antibiotics. Luckily, skin infections like Penny's are usually self-limiting; the rash typically lasts about 2 weeks
     and resolves on its own, with or without medical treatment. The doctor advised Penny to wait it out and keep
     using the corticosteroid cream. The cream will not kill the P. aeruginosa on Penny's skin, but it should calm her
     rash and minimize the itching by suppressing her body's inflammatory response to the bacteria.

Microbial Metabolism

FIGURE 8.1 Prokaryotes have great metabolic diversity with important consequences to other forms of life. Acidic mine drainage (left) is a
serious environmental problem resulting from the introduction of water and oxygen to sulfide-oxidizing bacteria during mining processes.
These bacteria produce large amounts of sulfuric acid as a byproduct of their metabolism, resulting in a low-pH environment that can kill
many aquatic plants and animals. On the other hand, some prokaryotes are essential to other life forms. Root nodules of many plants (right)
house nitrogen-fixing bacteria that convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, providing a usable nitrogen source for these plants. (credit

INTRODUCTION Throughout earth's history, microbial metabolism has been a driving force behind the
development and maintenance of the planet's biosphere. Eukaryotic organisms such as plants and animals typically
depend on organic molecules for energy, growth, and reproduction. Prokaryotes, on the other hand, can metabolize
a wide range of organic as well as inorganic matter, from complex organic molecules like cellulose to inorganic
molecules and ions such as atmospheric nitrogen (N2), molecular hydrogen (H2), sulfide (S2-), manganese (II) ions
(Mn2+), ferrous iron (Fe2+), and ferric iron (Fe3+), to name a few. By metabolizing such substances, microbes
chemically convert them to other forms. In some cases, microbial metabolism produces chemicals that can be
harmful to other organisms; in others, it produces substances that are essential to the metabolism and survival of
other life forms (Figure 8.1).

       Part 1

       Hannah is a 15-month-old girl from Washington state. She is spending the summer in Gambia, where her
       parents are working for a nongovernmental organization. About 3 weeks after her arrival in Gambia, Hannah's
       appetite began to diminish and her parents noticed that she seemed unusually sluggish, fatigued, and confused.
       She also seemed very irritable when she was outdoors, especially during the day. When she began vomiting, her

     The term used to describe all of the chemical reactions inside a cell is metabolism (Figure 8.2). Cellular processes
     such as the building or breaking down of complex molecules occur through series of stepwise, interconnected
     chemical reactions called metabolic pathways. Reactions that are spontaneous and release energy are exergonic
     reactions, whereas endergonic reactions require energy to proceed. The term anabolism refers to those
     endergonic metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis, converting simple molecular building blocks into more
     complex molecules, and fueled by the use of cellular energy. Conversely, the term catabolism refers to exergonic
     pathways that break down complex molecules into simpler ones. Molecular energy stored in the bonds of complex
     molecules is released in catabolic pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be used to produce high-energy
     molecules, which are used to drive anabolic pathways. Thus, in terms of energy and molecules, cells are continually
     balancing catabolism with anabolism.

     FIGURE 8.2 Metabolism includes catabolism and anabolism. Anabolic pathways require energy to synthesize larger molecules. Catabolic
     pathways generate energy by breaking down larger molecules. Both types of pathways are required for maintaining the cell's energy
     balance.

     Classification by Carbon and Energy Source

     Organisms can be identified according to the source of carbon they use for metabolism as well as their energy
     source. The prefixes auto- ("self") and hetero- ("other") refer to the origins of the carbon sources various organisms

can use. Organisms that convert inorganic carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic carbon compounds are autotrophs.
Plants and cyanobacteria are well-known examples of autotrophs. Conversely, heterotrophs rely on more complex
organic carbon compounds as nutrients; these are provided to them initially by autotrophs. Many organisms, ranging
from humans to many prokaryotes, including the well-studied Escherichia coli, are heterotrophic.

Organisms can also be identified by the energy source they use. All energy is derived from the transfer of electrons,
but the source of electrons differs between various types of organisms. The prefixes photo- ("light") and chemo-
("chemical") refer to the energy sources that various organisms use. Those that get their energy for electron transfer
from light are phototrophs, whereas chemotrophs obtain energy for electron transfer by breaking chemical bonds.
There are two types of chemotrophs: organotrophs and lithotrophs. Organotrophs, including humans, fungi, and
many prokaryotes, are chemotrophs that obtain energy from organic compounds. Lithotrophs ("litho" means "rock")
are chemotrophs that get energy from inorganic compounds, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and reduced iron.
Lithotrophy is unique to the microbial world.

The strategies used to obtain both carbon and energy can be combined for the classification of organisms according
to nutritional type. Most organisms are chemoheterotrophs because they use organic molecules as both their
electron and carbon sources. Table 8.1 summarizes this and the other classifications.

Oxidation and Reduction in Metabolism

The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to
fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. The transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the
cell to transfer and use energy incrementally; that is, in small packages rather than a single, destructive burst.
Reactions that remove electrons from donor molecules, leaving them oxidized, are oxidation reactions; those that
add electrons to acceptor molecules, leaving them reduced, are reduction reactions. Because electrons can move
from one molecule to another, oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. These pairs of reactions are called
oxidation-reduction reactions, or redox reactions.

Energy Carriers: NAD+, NADP+, FAD, and ATP

The energy released from the breakdown of the chemical bonds within nutrients can be stored either through the
reduction of electron carriers or in the bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In living systems, a small class of
286  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     compounds functions as mobile electron carriers, molecules that bind to and shuttle high-energy electrons
     between compounds in pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider originate from the B vitamin group
     and are derivatives of nucleotides; they are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotine adenine dinucleotide
     phosphate, and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These compounds can be easily reduced or oxidized. Nicotinamide
     adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) is the most common mobile electron carrier used in catabolism. NAD+ is the
     oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule. Nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate
     (NADP+), the oxidized form of an NAD+ variant that contains an extra phosphate group, is another important
     electron carrier; it forms NADPH when reduced. The oxidized form of flavin adenine dinucleotide is FAD, and its
     reduced form is FADH2. Both NAD+/NADH and FAD/FADH2 are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars
     during catabolism in chemoheterotrophs, whereas NADP+/NADPH plays an important role in anabolic reactions and
     photosynthesis. Collectively, FADH2, NADH, and NADPH are often referred to as having reducing power due to their
     ability to donate electrons to various chemical reactions.

     A living cell must be able to handle the energy released during catabolism in a way that enables the cell to store
     energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine
     triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the "energy currency" of the cell, and, like currency, this versatile compound
     can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate
     (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and a single phosphate group.
     Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA, and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA. The addition of a second
     phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP); the addition of a
     third phosphate group forms ATP (Figure 8.3). Adding a phosphate group to a molecule, a process called
     phosphorylation, requires energy. Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they
     are arranged in series, as they are in ADP and ATP. This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently
     unstable. Thus, the bonds between phosphate groups (one in ADP and two in ATP) are called high-energy
     phosphate bonds. When these high-energy bonds are broken to release one phosphate (called inorganic
     phosphate [Pi]) or two connected phosphate groups (called pyrophosphate [PPi]) from ATP through a process
     called dephosphorylation, energy is released to drive endergonic reactions (Figure 8.4).

     FIGURE 8.3 The energy released from dephosphorylation of ATP is used to drive cellular work, including anabolic pathways. ATP is
     regenerated through phosphorylation, harnessing the energy found in chemicals or from sunlight. (credit: modification of work by Robert

Enzyme Structure and Function

A substance that helps speed up a chemical reaction is a catalyst. Catalysts are not used or changed during
chemical reactions and, therefore, are reusable. Whereas inorganic molecules may serve as catalysts for a wide
range of chemical reactions, proteins called enzymes serve as catalysts for biochemical reactions inside cells.
Enzymes thus play an important role in controlling cellular metabolism.

An enzyme functions by lowering the activation energy of a chemical reaction inside the cell. Activation energy is
the energy needed to form or break chemical bonds and convert reactants to products (Figure 8.5). Enzymes lower
the activation energy by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to speed up the
reaction.

The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are called substrates, and the location within the enzyme where
the substrate binds is called the enzyme's active site. The characteristics of the amino acids near the active site
create a very specific chemical environment within the active site that induces suitability to binding, albeit briefly, to
a specific substrate (or substrates). Due to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates,
enzymes are known for their specificity. In fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure
changes slightly to find the best fit between the transition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate
and product) and the active site, just as a rubber glove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification
in the presence of substrate, along with the simultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit
(Figure 8.6). Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical
reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes have the ability to act on several different
structurally related substrates.
288  8 · Microbial Metabolism

                                                  FIGURE 8.5 Enzymes lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction.

     FIGURE 8.6 According to the induced-fit model, the active site of the enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon binding with the
     substrate.

     Enzymes are subject to influences by local environmental conditions such as pH, substrate concentration, and
     temperature. Although increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates, enzyme
     catalyzed or otherwise, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect chemical
     bonds within the active site, making them less well suited to bind substrates. High temperatures will eventually
     cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, to denature, losing their three-dimensional structure and function.
     Enzymes are also suited to function best within a certain pH range, and, as with temperature, extreme
     environmental pH values (acidic or basic) can cause enzymes to denature. Active-site amino-acid side chains have
     their own acidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis and, therefore, are sensitive to changes in pH.
     Another factor that influences enzyme activity is substrate concentration: Enzyme activity is increased at higher
     concentrations of substrate until it reaches a saturation point at which the enzyme can bind no additional substrate.
     Overall, enzymes are optimized to work best under the environmental conditions in which the organisms that
     produce them live. For example, while microbes that inhabit hot springs have enzymes that work best at high
     temperatures, human pathogens have enzymes that work best at 37°C. Similarly, while enzymes produced by most
     organisms work best at a neutral pH, microbes growing in acidic environments make enzymes optimized to low pH
     conditions, allowing for their growth at those conditions.
     Many enzymes do not work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific nonprotein helper molecules,
     either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Binding to
     these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes. Two types of helper
     molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (Fe2+) and magnesium (Mg2+)
     that help stabilize enzyme conformation and function. One example of an enzyme that requires a metal ion as a
     cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules, DNA polymerase, which requires a bound zinc ion (Zn2+) to
     function.
     Coenzymes are organic helper molecules that are required for enzyme action. Like enzymes, they are not consumed

and, hence, are reusable. The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins. Some vitamins are
precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes.

Some cofactors and coenzymes, like coenzyme A (CoA), often bind to the enzyme's active site, aiding in the
chemistry of the transition of a substrate to a product (Figure 8.7). In such cases, an enzyme lacking a necessary
cofactor or coenzyme is called an apoenzyme and is inactive. Conversely, an enzyme with the necessary associated
cofactor or coenzyme is called a holoenzyme and is active. NADH and ATP are also both examples of commonly
used coenzymes that provide high-energy electrons or phosphate groups, respectively, which bind to enzymes,
thereby activating them.

                FIGURE 8.7 The binding of a coenzyme or cofactor to an apoenzyme is often required to form an active holoenzyme.

    · What role do enzymes play in a chemical reaction?

Enzyme Inhibitors

Enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity. There are many different kinds of
molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms exist for doing so (Figure 8.8). A
competitive inhibitor is a molecule similar enough to a substrate that it can compete with the substrate for binding
to the active site by simply blocking the substrate from binding. For a competitive inhibitor to be effective, the
inhibitor concentration needs to be approximately equal to the substrate concentration. Sulfa drugs provide a good
example of competitive competition. They are used to treat bacterial infections because they bind to the active site
of an enzyme within the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway. When present in a sufficient dose, a sulfa drug
prevents folic acid synthesis, and bacteria are unable to grow because they cannot synthesize DNA, RNA, and
proteins. Humans are unaffected because we obtain folic acid from our diets.

On the other hand, a noncompetitive (allosteric) inhibitor binds to the enzyme at an allosteric site, a location
other than the active site, and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site by inducing a
conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (Figure 8.9). Because only one
inhibitor molecule is needed per enzyme for effective inhibition, the concentration of inhibitors needed for
noncompetitive inhibition is typically much lower than the substrate concentration.

In addition to allosteric inhibitors, there are allosteric activators that bind to locations on an enzyme away from the
active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme's active site(s) for its
substrate(s).

Allosteric control is an important mechanism of regulation of metabolic pathways involved in both catabolism and
anabolism. In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved also to use the products of their own metabolic
reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity. Feedback inhibition involves the use of a pathway product to
regulate its own further production. The cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing production
290  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     during anabolic or catabolic reactions (Figure 8.9).

     FIGURE 8.8 Enzyme activity can be regulated by either competitive inhibitors, which bind to the active site, or noncompetitive inhibitors,
     which bind to an allosteric site.

     FIGURE 8.9 (a) Binding of an allosteric inhibitor reduces enzyme activity, but binding of an allosteric activator increases enzyme activity. (b)

8.2 Catabolism of Carbohydrates

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe why glycolysis is not oxygen dependent
    · Define and describe the net yield of three-carbon molecules, ATP, and NADH from glycolysis
    · Explain how three-carbon pyruvate molecules are converted into two-carbon acetyl groups that can be

        funneled into the Krebs cycle.
    · Define and describe the net yield of CO2, GTP/ATP, FADH2, and NADH from the Krebs cycle
    · Explain how intermediate carbon molecules of the Krebs cycle can be used in a cell

Extensive enzyme pathways exist for breaking down carbohydrates to capture energy in ATP bonds. In addition,
many catabolic pathways produce intermediate molecules that are also used as building blocks for anabolism.
Understanding these processes is important for several reasons. First, because the main metabolic processes
involved are common to a wide range of chemoheterotrophic organisms, we can learn a great deal about human
metabolism by studying metabolism in more easily manipulated bacteria like E. coli. Second, because animal and
human pathogens are also chemoheterotrophs, learning about the details of metabolism in these bacteria, including
possible differences between bacterial and human pathways, is useful for the diagnosis of pathogens as well as for
the discovery of antimicrobial therapies targeting specific pathogens. Last, learning specifically about the pathways
involved in chemoheterotrophic metabolism also serves as a basis for comparing other more unusual metabolic
strategies used by microbes. Although the chemical source of electrons initiating electron transfer is different
between chemoheterorophs and chemoautotrophs, many similar processes are used in both types of organisms.

The typical example used to introduce concepts of metabolism to students is carbohydrate catabolism. For
chemoheterotrophs, our examples of metabolism start with the catabolism of polysaccharides such as glycogen,
starch, or cellulose. Enzymes such as amylase, which breaks down glycogen or starch, and cellulases, which break
down cellulose, can cause the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between the glucose monomers in these polymers,
releasing glucose for further catabolism.

Glycolysis

For bacteria, eukaryotes, and most archaea, glycolysis is the most common pathway for the catabolism of glucose;
it produces energy, reduced electron carriers, and precursor molecules for cellular metabolism. Every living
organism carries out some form of glycolysis, suggesting this mechanism is an ancient universal metabolic process.
The process itself does not use oxygen; however, glycolysis can be coupled with additional metabolic processes that
are either aerobic or anaerobic. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It begins
with a single six-carbon glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate.
Pyruvate may be broken down further after glycolysis to harness more energy through aerobic or anaerobic
respiration, but many organisms, including many microbes, may be unable to respire; for these organisms, glycolysis
may be their only source of generating ATP.

The type of glycolysis found in animals and that is most common in microbes is the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
(EMP) pathway, named after Gustav Embden (1874-1933), Otto Meyerhof (1884-1951), and Jakub Parnas
(1884-1949). Glycolysis using the EMP pathway consists of two distinct phases (Figure 8.10). The first part of the
pathway, called the energy investment phase, uses energy from two ATP molecules to modify a glucose molecule so
that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into two phosphorylated three-carbon molecules called
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). The second part of the pathway, called the energy payoff phase, extracts energy
by oxidizing G3P to pyruvate, producing four ATP molecules and reducing two molecules of NAD+ to two molecules
of NADH, using electrons that originated from glucose. (A discussion and illustration of the full EMP pathway with
chemical structures and enzyme names appear in Appendix C.)

The ATP molecules produced during the energy payoff phase of glycolysis are formed by substrate-level
292  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     phosphorylation (Figure 8.11), one of two mechanisms for producing ATP. In substrate-level phosphorylation, a
     phosphate group is removed from an organic molecule and is directly transferred to an available ADP molecule,
     producing ATP. During glycolysis, high-energy phosphate groups from the intermediate molecules are added to ADP
     to make ATP.

     Overall, in this process of glycolysis, the net gain from the breakdown of a single glucose molecule is:

         · two ATP molecules
         · two NADH molecule, and
         · two pyruvate molecules.

     FIGURE 8.10 The energy investment phase of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis pathway uses two ATP molecules to phosphorylate
     glucose, forming two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) molecules. The energy payoff phase harnesses the energy in the G3P molecules,
     producing four ATP molecules, two NADH molecules, and two pyruvates.

FIGURE 8.11 The ATP made during glycolysis is a result of substrate-level phosphorylation. One of the two enzymatic reactions in the
energy payoff phase of Embden Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis that produce ATP in this way is shown here.

Other Glycolytic Pathways

When we refer to glycolysis, unless otherwise indicated, we are referring to the EMP pathway used by animals and
many bacteria. However, some prokaryotes use alternative glycolytic pathways. One important alternative is the
Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, named after its discoverers Nathan Entner and Michael Doudoroff (1911-1975).
Although some bacteria, including the opportunistic gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, contain
only the ED pathway for glycolysis, other bacteria, like E. coli, have the ability to use either the ED pathway or the
EMP pathway.

A third type of glycolytic pathway that occurs in all cells, which is quite different from the previous two pathways, is
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) also called the phosphogluconate pathway or the hexose monophosphate
shunt. Evidence suggests that the PPP may be the most ancient universal glycolytic pathway. The intermediates
from the PPP are used for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and amino acids. Therefore, this glycolytic pathway may
be favored when the cell has need for nucleic acid and/or protein synthesis, respectively. A discussion and
illustration of the complete ED pathway and PPP with chemical structures and enzyme names appear in Appendix C.

    · When might an organism use the ED pathway or the PPP for glycolysis?

Transition Reaction, Coenzyme A, and the Krebs Cycle

Glycolysis produces pyruvate, which can be further oxidized to capture more energy. For pyruvate to enter the next
oxidative pathway, it must first be decarboxylated by the enzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase to a two-carbon
acetyl group in the transition reaction, also called the bridge reaction (see Appendix C and Figure 8.12). In the
transition reaction, electrons are also transferred to NAD+ to form NADH. To proceed to the next phase of this
metabolic process, the comparatively tiny two-carbon acetyl must be attached to a very large carrier compound
called coenzyme A (CoA). The transition reaction occurs in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotes; in prokaryotes, it
occurs in the cytoplasm because prokaryotes lack membrane-enclosed organelles.
294  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     FIGURE 8.12 (a) Coenzyme A is shown here without an attached acetyl group. (b) Coenzyme A is shown here with an attached acetyl group.

     The Krebs cycle transfers remaining electrons from the acetyl group produced during the transition reaction to
     electron carrier molecules, thus reducing them. The Krebs cycle also occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes along
     with glycolysis and the transition reaction, but it takes place in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotic cells where
     the transition reaction also occurs. The Krebs cycle is named after its discoverer, British scientist Hans Adolf Krebs
     (1900-1981) and is also called the citric acid cycle, or the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) because citric acid has
     three carboxyl groups in its structure. Unlike glycolysis, the Krebs cycle is a closed loop: The last part of the pathway
     regenerates the compound used in the first step (Figure 8.13). The eight steps of the cycle are a series of chemical
     reactions that capture the two-carbon acetyl group (the CoA carrier does not enter the Krebs cycle) from the
     transition reaction, which is added to a four-carbon intermediate in the Krebs cycle, producing the six-carbon
     intermediate citric acid (giving the alternate name for this cycle). As one turn of the cycle returns to the starting
     point of the four-carbon intermediate, the cycle produces two CO2 molecules, one ATP molecule (or an equivalent,
     such as guanosine triphosphate [GTP]) produced by substrate-level phosphorylation, and three molecules of NADH
     and one of FADH2. (A discussion and detailed illustration of the full Krebs cycle appear in Appendix C.)
     Although many organisms use the Krebs cycle as described as part of glucose metabolism, several of the
     intermediate compounds in the Krebs cycle can be used in synthesizing a wide variety of important cellular
     molecules, including amino acids, chlorophylls, fatty acids, and nucleotides; therefore, the cycle is both anabolic
     and catabolic (Figure 8.14).

296  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     We have just discussed two pathways in glucose catabolism--glycolysis and the Krebs cycle--that generate ATP by
     substrate-level phosphorylation. Most ATP, however, is generated during a separate process called oxidative
     phosphorylation, which occurs during cellular respiration. Cellular respiration begins when electrons are
     transferred from NADH and FADH2--made in glycolysis, the transition reaction, and the Krebs cycle--through a
     series of chemical reactions to a final inorganic electron acceptor (either oxygen in aerobic respiration or non-
     oxygen inorganic molecules in anaerobic respiration). These electron transfers take place on the inner part of the
     cell membrane of prokaryotic cells or in specialized protein complexes in the inner membrane of the mitochondria
     of eukaryotic cells. The energy of the electrons is harvested to generate an electrochemical gradient across the
     membrane, which is used to make ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.

     Electron Transport System

     The electron transport system (ETS) is the last component involved in the process of cellular respiration; it
     comprises a series of membrane-associated protein complexes and associated mobile accessory electron carriers
     (Figure 8.15). Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons
     from NADH and FADH2 are passed rapidly from one ETS electron carrier to the next. These carriers can pass
     electrons along in the ETS because of their redox potential. For a protein or chemical to accept electrons, it must
     have a more positive redox potential than the electron donor. Therefore, electrons move from electron carriers with
     more negative redox potential to those with more positive redox potential. The four major classes of electron
     carriers involved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic electron transport systems are the cytochromes, flavoproteins,
     iron-sulfur proteins, and the quinones.

     In aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor (i.e., the one having the most positive redox potential) at the end
     of the ETS is an oxygen molecule (O2) that becomes reduced to water (H2O) by the final ETS carrier. This electron
     carrier, cytochrome oxidase, differs between bacterial types and can be used to differentiate closely related
     bacteria for diagnoses. For example, the gram-negative opportunist Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-
     negative cholera-causing Vibrio cholerae use cytochrome c oxidase, which can be detected by the oxidase test,
     whereas other gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, like E. coli, are negative for this test because they produce
     different cytochrome oxidase types.

     There are many circumstances under which aerobic respiration is not possible, including any one or more of the
     following:

     · The cell lacks genes encoding an appropriate cytochrome oxidase for transferring electrons to oxygen at the
        end of the electron transport system.

     · The cell lacks genes encoding enzymes to minimize the severely damaging effects of dangerous oxygen
        radicals produced during aerobic respiration, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or superoxide

     · The cell lacks a sufficient amount of oxygen to carry out aerobic respiration.

     One possible alternative to aerobic respiration is anaerobic respiration, using an inorganic molecule other than

     oxygen as a final electron acceptor. There are many types of anaerobic respiration found in bacteria and archaea.

     Denitrifiers are important soil bacteria that use nitrate  and nitrite          as final electron acceptors,

     producing nitrogen gas (N2). Many aerobically respiring bacteria, including E. coli, switch to using nitrate as a final

     electron acceptor and producing nitrite when oxygen levels have been depleted.

     Microbes using anaerobic respiration commonly have an intact Krebs cycle, so these organisms can access the
     energy of the NADH and FADH2 molecules formed. However, anaerobic respirers use altered ETS carriers encoded
     by their genomes, including distinct complexes for electron transfer to their final electron acceptors. Smaller
     electrochemical gradients are generated from these electron transfer systems, so less ATP is formed through
     anaerobic respiration.

Chemiosmosis, Proton Motive Force, and Oxidative Phosphorylation

In each transfer of an electron through the ETS, the electron loses energy, but with some transfers, the energy is
stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions (H+) across a membrane. In prokaryotic cells, H+ is
pumped to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane (called the periplasmic space in gram-negative and gram-
positive bacteria), and in eukaryotic cells, they are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner
mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space. There is an uneven distribution of H+ across the membrane
that establishes an electrochemical gradient because H+ ions are positively charged (electrical) and there is a higher
concentration (chemical) on one side of the membrane. This electrochemical gradient formed by the accumulation
of H+ (also known as a proton) on one side of the membrane compared with the other is referred to as the proton
motive force (PMF). Because the ions involved are H+, a pH gradient is also established, with the side of the
membrane having the higher concentration of H+ being more acidic. Beyond the use of the PMF to make ATP, as
discussed in this chapter, the PMF can also be used to drive other energetically unfavorable processes, including
nutrient transport and flagella rotation for motility.

The potential energy of this electrochemical gradient generated by the ETS causes the H+ to diffuse across a
membrane (the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells and the inner membrane in mitochondria in eukaryotic cells).
This flow of hydrogen ions across the membrane, called chemiosmosis, must occur through a channel in the
membrane via a membrane-bound enzyme complex called ATP synthase (Figure 8.15). The tendency for
movement in this way is much like water accumulated on one side of a dam, moving through the dam when opened.
ATP synthase (like a combination of the intake and generator of a hydroelectric dam) is a complex protein that acts
as a tiny generator, turning by the force of the H+ diffusing through the enzyme, down their electrochemical gradient
from where there are many mutually repelling H+ to where there are fewer H+. In prokaryotic cells, H+ flows from
the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane into the cytoplasm, whereas in eukaryotic mitochondria, H+ flows from
the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. The turning of the parts of this molecular machine
regenerates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) by oxidative phosphorylation, a second mechanism for
making ATP that harvests the potential energy stored within an electrochemical gradient.

FIGURE 8.15 The bacterial electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes, electron carriers, and ion pumps that is used to pump
H+ out of the bacterial cytoplasm into the extracellular space. H+ flows back down the electrochemical gradient into the bacterial
cytoplasm through ATP synthase, providing the energy for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation.(credit: modification of work by
Klaus Hoffmeier)

The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of
298  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     hydrogen ions that the electron transport system complexes can pump through the membrane varies between
     different species of organisms. In aerobic respiration in mitochondria, the passage of electrons from one molecule
     of NADH generates enough proton motive force to make three ATP molecules by oxidative phosphorylation, whereas
     the passage of electrons from one molecule of FADH2 generates enough proton motive force to make only two ATP
     molecules. Thus, the 10 NADH molecules made per glucose during glycolysis, the transition reaction, and the Krebs
     cycle carry enough energy to make 30 ATP molecules, whereas the two FADH2 molecules made per glucose during
     these processes provide enough energy to make four ATP molecules. Overall, the theoretical maximum yield of ATP
     made during the complete aerobic respiration of glucose is 38 molecules, with four being made by substrate-level
     phosphorylation and 34 being made by oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 8.16). In reality, the total ATP yield is
     usually less, ranging from one to 34 ATP molecules, depending on whether the cell is using aerobic respiration or
     anaerobic respiration; in eukaryotic cells, some energy is expended to transport intermediates from the cytoplasm
     into the mitochondria, affecting ATP yield.

     Figure 8.16 summarizes the theoretical maximum yields of ATP from various processes during the complete aerobic
     respiration of one glucose molecule.

Many cells are unable to carry out respiration because of one or more of the following circumstances:

  1. The cell lacks a sufficient amount of any appropriate, inorganic, final electron acceptor to carry out cellular
        respiration.

  2. The cell lacks genes to make appropriate complexes and electron carriers in the electron transport system.
  3. The cell lacks genes to make one or more enzymes in the Krebs cycle.

Whereas lack of an appropriate inorganic final electron acceptor is environmentally dependent, the other two
conditions are genetically determined. Thus, many prokaryotes, including members of the clinically important genus
Streptococcus, are permanently incapable of respiration, even in the presence of oxygen. Conversely, many
prokaryotes are facultative, meaning that, should the environmental conditions change to provide an appropriate
inorganic final electron acceptor for respiration, organisms containing all the genes required to do so will switch to
cellular respiration for glucose metabolism because respiration allows for much greater ATP production per glucose
molecule.

If respiration does not occur, NADH must be reoxidized to NAD+ for reuse as an electron carrier for glycolysis, the
cell's only mechanism for producing any ATP, to continue. Some living systems use an organic molecule (commonly
pyruvate) as a final electron acceptor through a process called fermentation. Fermentation does not involve an
electron transport system and does not directly produce any additional ATP beyond that produced during glycolysis
by substrate-level phosphorylation. Organisms carrying out fermentation, called fermenters, produce a maximum of
two ATP molecules per glucose during glycolysis. Table 8.2 compares the final electron acceptors and methods of
ATP synthesis in aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, and fermentation. Note that the number of ATP
molecules shown for glycolysis assumes the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. The number of ATP molecules
made by substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) versus oxidative phosphorylation (OP) are indicated.

Microbial fermentation processes have been manipulated by humans and are used extensively in the production of
various foods and other commercial products, including pharmaceuticals. Microbial fermentation can also be useful
for identifying microbes for diagnostic purposes.
300  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     Fermentation by some bacteria, like those in yogurt and other soured food products, and by animals in muscles
     during oxygen depletion, is lactic acid fermentation. The chemical reaction of lactic acid fermentation is as follows:

                                                          

     Bacteria of several gram-positive genera, including Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Streptococcus, are collectively
     known as the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and various strains are important in food production. During yogurt and
     cheese production, the highly acidic environment generated by lactic acid fermentation denatures proteins
     contained in milk, causing it to solidify. When lactic acid is the only fermentation product, the process is said to be
     homolactic fermentation; such is the case for Lactobacillus delbrueckii and S. thermophiles used in yogurt
     production. However, many bacteria perform heterolactic fermentation, producing a mixture of lactic acid, ethanol
     and/or acetic acid, and CO2 as a result, because of their use of the branched pentose phosphate pathway instead of
     the EMP pathway for glycolysis. One important heterolactic fermenter is Leuconostoc mesenteroides, which is used
     for souring vegetables like cucumbers and cabbage, producing pickles and sauerkraut, respectively.

     Lactic acid bacteria are also important medically. The production of low pH environments within the body inhibits
     the establishment and growth of pathogens in these areas. For example, the vaginal microbiota is composed largely
     of lactic acid bacteria, but when these bacteria are reduced, yeast can proliferate, causing a yeast infection.
     Additionally, lactic acid bacteria are important in maintaining the health of the gastrointestinal tract and, as such,
     are the primary component of probiotics.

     Another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation, which produces ethanol. The ethanol fermentation
     reaction is shown in Figure 8.17. In the first reaction, the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group
     from pyruvate, releasing CO2 gas while producing the two-carbon molecule acetaldehyde. The second reaction,
     catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, transfers an electron from NADH to acetaldehyde, producing
     ethanol and NAD+. The ethanol fermentation of pyruvate by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used in the
     production of alcoholic beverages and also makes bread products rise due to CO2 production. Outside of the food
     industry, ethanol fermentation of plant products is important in biofuel production.

     FIGURE 8.17 The chemical reactions of alcohol fermentation are shown here. Ethanol fermentation is important in the production of
     alcoholic beverages and bread.

     Beyond lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation, many other fermentation methods occur in prokaryotes,
     all for the purpose of ensuring an adequate supply of NAD+ for glycolysis (Table 8.3). Without these pathways,
     glycolysis would not occur and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose. It should be noted that
     most forms of fermentation besides homolactic fermentation produce gas, commonly CO2 and/or hydrogen gas.
     Many of these different types of fermentation pathways are also used in food production and each results in the
     production of different organic acids, contributing to the unique flavor of a particular fermented food product. The
     propionic acid produced during propionic acid fermentation contributes to the distinctive flavor of Swiss cheese, for
     example.

     Several fermentation products are important commercially outside of the food industry. For example, chemical
     solvents such as acetone and butanol are produced during acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation. Complex organic
     pharmaceutical compounds used in antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), vaccines, and vitamins are produced through mixed
     acid fermentation. Fermentation products are used in the laboratory to differentiate various bacteria for diagnostic
     purposes. For example, enteric bacteria are known for their ability to perform mixed acid fermentation, reducing the
     pH, which can be detected using a pH indicator. Similarly, the bacterial production of acetoin during butanediol
     fermentation can also be detected. Gas production from fermentation can also be seen in an inverted Durham tube
     that traps produced gas in a broth culture.

Microbes can also be differentiated according to the substrates they can ferment. For example, E. coli can ferment
lactose, forming gas, whereas some of its close gram-negative relatives cannot. The ability to ferment the sugar
alcohol sorbitol is used to identify the pathogenic enterohemorrhagic O157:H7 strain of E. coli because, unlike other
E. coli strains, it is unable to ferment sorbitol. Last, mannitol fermentation differentiates the mannitol-fermenting
Staphylococcus aureus from other non-mannitol-fermenting staphylococci.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Identifying Bacteria by Using API Test Panels

Identification of a microbial isolate is essential for the proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patients.
Scientists have developed techniques that identify bacteria according to their biochemical characteristics. Typically,
they either examine the use of specific carbon sources as substrates for fermentation or other metabolic reactions,
or they identify fermentation products or specific enzymes present in reactions. In the past, microbiologists have
used individual test tubes and plates to conduct biochemical testing. However, scientists, especially those in clinical
laboratories, now more frequently use plastic, disposable, multitest panels that contain a number of miniature
reaction tubes, each typically including a specific substrate and pH indicator. After inoculation of the test panel with
a small sample of the microbe in question and incubation, scientists can compare the results to a database that
includes the expected results for specific biochemical reactions for known microbes, thus enabling rapid
identification of a sample microbe. These test panels have allowed scientists to reduce costs while improving
efficiency and reproducibility by performing a larger number of tests simultaneously.
302  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     Many commercial, miniaturized biochemical test panels cover a number of clinically important groups of bacteria
     and yeasts. One of the earliest and most popular test panels is the Analytical Profile Index (API) panel invented in
     the 1970s. Once some basic laboratory characterization of a given strain has been performed, such as determining
     the strain's Gram morphology, an appropriate test strip that contains 10 to 20 different biochemical tests for
     differentiating strains within that microbial group can be used. Currently, the various API strips can be used to
     quickly and easily identify more than 600 species of bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, and approximately 100
     different types of yeasts. Based on the colors of the reactions when metabolic end products are present, due to the
     presence of pH indicators, a metabolic profile is created from the results (Figure 8.18). Microbiologists can then
     compare the sample's profile to the database to identify the specific microbe.

       Many of Hannah's symptoms are consistent with several different infections, including influenza and pneumonia.
       However, her sluggish reflexes along with her light sensitivity and stiff neck suggest some possible involvement
       of the central nervous system, perhaps indicating meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the cerebrospinal fluid
       (CSF) around the brain and spinal cord that causes inflammation of the meninges, the protective layers covering
       the brain. Meningitis can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Although all forms of meningitis are serious,
       bacterial meningitis is particularly serious. Bacterial meningitis may be caused by several different bacteria, but
       the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative, bean-shaped diplococcus, is a common cause and leads
       to death within 1 to 2 days in 5% to 10% of patients.

       Given the potential seriousness of Hannah's conditions, her physician advised her parents to take her to the
       hospital in the Gambian capital of Banjul and there have her tested and treated for possible meningitis. After a
       3-hour drive to the hospital, Hannah was immediately admitted. Physicians took a blood sample and performed
       a lumbar puncture to test her CSF. They also immediately started her on a course of the antibiotic ceftriaxone,

     molecules, both naturally occurring and those made by human processes, for use as carbon sources. In this section,

catabolism, eventually leading into glycolysis, the transition reaction, and the Krebs cycle pathways. Metabolic
pathways should be considered to be porous--that is, substances enter from other pathways, and intermediates
leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems. Many of the substrates, intermediates, and
products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.

Lipid Catabolism

Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals. They are made of glycerol and three fatty acids (see
Figure 7.12). Phospholipids compose the cell and organelle membranes of all organisms except the archaea.
Phospholipid structure is similar to triglycerides except that one of the fatty acids is replaced by a phosphorylated
head group (see Figure 7.13). Triglycerides and phospholipids are broken down first by releasing fatty acid chains
(and/or the phosphorylated head group, in the case of phospholipids) from the three-carbon glycerol backbone. The
reactions breaking down triglycerides are catalyzed by lipases and those involving phospholipids are catalyzed by
phospholipases. These enzymes contribute to the virulence of certain microbes, such as the bacterium
Staphylococcus aureus and the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. These microbes use phospholipases to destroy
lipids and phospholipids in host cells and then use the catabolic products for energy (see Virulence Factors of
Bacterial and Viral Pathogens).

The resulting products of lipid catabolism, glycerol and fatty acids, can be further degraded. Glycerol can be
phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate and easily converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which continues
through glycolysis. The released fatty acids are catabolized in a process called -oxidation, which sequentially
removes two-carbon acetyl groups from the ends of fatty acid chains, reducing NAD+ and FAD to produce NADH and
FADH2, respectively, whose electrons can be used to make ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The acetyl groups
produced during -oxidation are carried by coenzyme A to the Krebs cycle, and their movement through this cycle
results in their degradation to CO2, producing ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and additional NADH and
FADH2 molecules (see Appendix C for a detailed illustration of -oxidation).

Other types of lipids can also be degraded by certain microbes. For example, the ability of certain pathogens, like
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to degrade cholesterol contributes to their virulence. The side chains of cholesterol
can be easily removed enzymatically, but degradation of the remaining fused rings is more problematic. The four
fused rings are sequentially broken in a multistep process facilitated by specific enzymes, and the resulting
products, including pyruvate, can be further catabolized in the Krebs cycle.

Protein Catabolism

Proteins are degraded through the concerted action of a variety of microbial protease enzymes. Extracellular
proteases cut proteins internally at specific amino acid sequences, breaking them down into smaller peptides that
can then be taken up by cells. Some clinically important pathogens can be identified by their ability to produce a
specific type of extracellular protease. For example, the production of the extracellular protease gelatinase by
members of the genera Proteus and Serratia can be used to distinguish them from other gram-negative enteric
bacteria. Following inoculation and growth of microbes in gelatin broth, degradation of the gelatin protein due to
gelatinase production prevents solidification of gelatin when refrigerated. Other pathogens can be distinguished by
their ability to degrade casein, the main protein found in milk. When grown on skim milk agar, production of the
extracellular protease caseinase causes degradation of casein, which appears as a zone of clearing around the
microbial growth. Caseinase production by the opportunist pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be used to
distinguish it from other related gram-negative bacteria.

After extracellular protease degradation and uptake of peptides in the cell, the peptides can then be broken down
further into individual amino acids by additional intracellular proteases, and each amino acid can be enzymatically
deaminated to remove the amino group. The remaining molecules can then enter the transition reaction or the
Krebs cycle.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 3

       Because bacterial meningitis progresses so rapidly, Hannah's doctors had decided to treat her aggressively with
       antibiotics, based on empirical observation of her symptoms. However, laboratory testing to confirm the cause
       of Hannah's meningitis was still important for several reasons. N. meningitidis is an infectious pathogen that can
       be spread from person to person through close contact; therefore, if tests confirm N. meningitidis as the cause
       of Hannah's symptoms, Hannah's parents and others who came into close contact with her might need to be
       vaccinated or receive prophylactic antibiotics to lower their risk of contracting the disease. On the other hand, if
       it turns out that N. meningitidis is not the cause, Hannah's doctors might need to change her treatment.

       The clinical laboratory performed a Gram stain on Hannah's blood and CSF samples. The Gram stain showed the
       presence of a bean-shaped gram-negative diplococcus. The technician in the hospital lab cultured Hannah's
       blood sample on both blood agar and chocolate agar, and the bacterium that grew on both media formed gray,
       nonhemolytic colonies. Next, he performed an oxidase test on this bacterium and determined that it was
       oxidase positive. Last, he examined the repertoire of sugars that the bacterium could use as a carbon source and
       found that the bacterium was positive for glucose and maltose use but negative for lactose and sucrose use. All
       of these test results are consistent with characteristics of N. meningitidis.

     8.6 Photosynthesis

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the function and locations of photosynthetic pigments in eukaryotes and prokaryotes
         · Describe the major products of the light-dependent and light-independent reactions
         · Describe the reactions that produce glucose in a photosynthetic cell
         · Compare and contrast cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation

     Heterotrophic organisms ranging from E. coli to humans rely on the chemical energy found mainly in carbohydrate
     molecules. Many of these carbohydrates are produced by photosynthesis, the biochemical process by which
     phototrophic organisms convert solar energy (sunlight) into chemical energy. Although photosynthesis is most
     commonly associated with plants, microbial photosynthesis is also a significant supplier of chemical energy, fueling
     many diverse ecosystems. In this section, we will focus on microbial photosynthesis.

     Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent
     reactions (Figure 8.19). In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigment molecules
     in photosynthetic membranes and converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the
     chemical energy produced by the light-dependent reactions is used to drive the assembly of sugar molecules using
     CO2; however, these reactions are still light dependent because the products of the light-dependent reactions
     necessary for driving them are short-lived. The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and either NADPH or NADH
     to temporarily store energy. These energy carriers are used in the light-independent reactions to drive the
     energetically unfavorable process of "fixing" inorganic CO2 in an organic form, sugar.

These products are used by the light-independent reactions to fix CO2, producing organic carbon molecules.

Photosynthetic Structures in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes

In all phototrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside a chloroplast, an organelle that arose in
eukaryotes by endosymbiosis of a photosynthetic bacterium (see Unique Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells). These
chloroplasts are enclosed by a double membrane with inner and outer layers. Within the chloroplast is a third
membrane that forms stacked, disc-shaped photosynthetic structures called thylakoids (Figure 8.20). A stack of
thylakoids is called a granum, and the space surrounding the granum within the chloroplast is called stroma.

Photosynthetic membranes in prokaryotes, by contrast, are not organized into distinct membrane-enclosed
organelles; rather, they are infolded regions of the plasma membrane. In cyanobacteria, for example, these infolded
regions are also referred to as thylakoids. In either case, embedded within the thylakoid membranes or other
photosynthetic bacterial membranes are photosynthetic pigment molecules organized into one or more
photosystems, where light energy is actually converted into chemical energy.

Photosynthetic pigments within the photosynthetic membranes are organized into photosystems, each of which is
composed of a light-harvesting (antennae) complex and a reaction center. The light-harvesting complex consists of
multiple proteins and associated pigments that each may absorb light energy and, thus, become excited. This
energy is transferred from one pigment molecule to another until eventually (after about a millionth of a second) it is
delivered to the reaction center. Up to this point, only energy--not electrons--has been transferred between
molecules. The reaction center contains a pigment molecule that can undergo oxidation upon excitation, actually
giving up an electron. It is at this step in photosynthesis that light energy is converted into an excited electron.

Different kinds of light-harvesting pigments absorb unique patterns of wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments
reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear the corresponding color. Examples of
photosynthetic pigments (molecules used to absorb solar energy) are bacteriochlorophylls (green, purple, or red),
carotenoids (orange, red, or yellow), chlorophylls (green), phycocyanins (blue), and phycoerythrins (red). By having
mixtures of pigments, an organism can absorb energy from more wavelengths. Because photosynthetic bacteria
commonly grow in competition for sunlight, each type of photosynthetic bacteria is optimized for harvesting the
wavelengths of light to which it is commonly exposed, leading to stratification of microbial communities in aquatic
and soil ecosystems by light quality and penetration.

Once the light harvesting complex transfers the energy to the reaction center, the reaction center delivers its high-
energy electrons, one by one, to an electron carrier in an electron transport system, and electron transfer through
306  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     the ETS is initiated. The ETS is similar to that used in cellular respiration and is embedded within the photosynthetic
     membrane. Ultimately, the electron is used to produce NADH or NADPH. The electrochemical gradient that forms
     across the photosynthetic membrane is used to generate ATP by chemiosmosis through the process of
     photophosphorylation, another example of oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 8.21).

     FIGURE 8.20 (a) Photosynthesis in eukaryotes takes place in chloroplasts, which contain thylakoids stacked into grana. (b) A
     photosynthetic prokaryote has infolded regions of the plasma membrane that function like thylakoids. (credit: scale bar data from Matt
     Russell.)

     FIGURE 8.21 This figure summarizes how a photosystem works. Light harvesting (LH) pigments absorb light energy, converting it to
     chemical energy. The energy is passed from one LH pigment to another until it reaches a reaction center (RC) pigment, exciting an electron.
     This high-energy electron is lost from the RC pigment and passed through an electron transport system (ETS), ultimately producing NADH
     or NADPH and ATP. A reduced molecule (H2A) donates an electron, replacing electrons to the electron-deficient RC pigment.

     For photosynthesis to continue, the electron lost from the reaction center pigment must be replaced. The source of

     this electron (H2A) differentiates the oxygenic photosynthesis of plants and cyanobacteria from anoxygenic
     photosynthesis carried out by other types of bacterial phototrophs (Figure 8.22). In oxygenic photosynthesis, H2O
     is split and supplies the electron to the reaction center. Because oxygen is generated as a byproduct and is released,

     this type of photosynthesis is referred to as oxygenic photosynthesis. However, when other reduced compounds

     serve as the electron donor, oxygen is not generated; these types of photosynthesis are called anoxygenic

     photosynthesis. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or thiosulfate  can serve as the electron donor, generating

After several scientists hypothesized that two light reactions, rather than one, were required to split water and
capture energy, Joan Mary Anderson undertook a series of experiments to prove the existence of two types of
photosystems: photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) (Figure 8.23). Working with colleague Keith
Boardman, Anderson chemically fragmented active chloroplasts, then used a centrifuge to separate the
components. She was able to demonstrate that different portions of the chloroplasts produced different products,
thereby showing that there were two parts to the photosystems. This work also laid the foundation to understanding
how the structures within the chloroplasts related to the different systems. Cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts
have both photosystems, whereas anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria use only one of the photosystems. Both
photosystems are excited by light energy simultaneously. If the cell requires both ATP and NADPH for biosynthesis,
then it will carry out noncyclic photophosphorylation. Upon passing of the PSII reaction center electron to the ETS
that connects PSII and PSI, the lost electron from the PSII reaction center is replaced by the splitting of water. The
excited PSI reaction center electron is used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH and is replaced by the electron exiting the
ETS. The flow of electrons in this way is called the Z-scheme.

If a cell's need for ATP is significantly greater than its need for NADPH, it may bypass the production of reducing
power through cyclic photophosphorylation. Only PSI is used during cyclic photophosphorylation; the high-energy
electron of the PSI reaction center is passed to an ETS carrier and then ultimately returns to the oxidized PSI
reaction center pigment, thereby reducing it.

anoxygenic photosynthesis, which does not produce oxygen.

     cell's ATP needs outweigh those for NADPH, cyanobacteria and plants will use only PSI, and its reaction center electron is passed to the
     ETS to generate a proton motive force used for ATP synthesis.

carbohydrate molecules, which can survive for hundreds of millions of years, for long-term energy storage. The
carbon comes from CO2, the gas that is a waste product of cellular respiration.

The Calvin-Benson cycle (named for Melvin Calvin [1911-1997] and Andrew Benson [1917-2015]), the
biochemical pathway used for fixation of CO2, is located within the cytoplasm of photosynthetic bacteria and in the
stroma of eukaryotic chloroplasts. The light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three
basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration (see Appendix C for a detailed illustration of the Calvin cycle).

    · Fixation: The enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) catalyzes the addition of a CO2 to
        ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This results in the production of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).

    · Reduction: Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH (from the light-dependent reactions) are used to convert
        3-PGA into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Some G3P is then used to build glucose.

    · Regeneration: The remaining G3P not used to synthesize glucose is used to regenerate RuBP, enabling the
        system to continue CO2 fixation. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions.

The Calvin cycle is used extensively by plants and photoautotrophic bacteria, and the enzyme RuBisCO is said to be
the most plentiful enzyme on earth, composing 30%-50% of the total soluble protein in plant chloroplasts.1
However, besides its prevalent use in photoautotrophs, the Calvin cycle is also used by many nonphotosynthetic
chemoautotrophs to fix CO2. Additionally, other bacteria and archaea use alternative systems for CO2 fixation.
Although most bacteria using Calvin cycle alternatives are chemoautotrophic, certain green sulfur photoautotrophic
bacteria have been also shown to use an alternative CO2 fixation pathway.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Define and describe the importance of microorganisms in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen,
        and sulfur

    · Define and give an example of bioremediation

Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight for phototrophs or as inorganic molecules for
chemoautotrophs. The six most common elements associated with organic molecules--carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur--take a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere,
on land, in water, or beneath earth's surface. Geologic processes, such as erosion, water drainage, the movement of
the continental plates, and weathering, all are involved in the cycling of elements on earth. Because geology and
chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms
and their nonliving environment is called a biogeochemical cycle. Here, we will focus on the function of
microorganisms in these cycles, which play roles at each step, most frequently interconverting oxidized versions of
molecules with reduced ones.

Carbon Cycle

Carbon is one of the most important elements to living organisms, as shown by its abundance and presence in all
organic molecules. The carbon cycle exemplifies the connection between organisms in various ecosystems. Carbon
is exchanged between heterotrophs and autotrophs within and between ecosystems primarily by way of
atmospheric CO2, a fully oxidized version of carbon that serves as the basic building block that autotrophs use to
build multicarbon, high-energy organic molecules such as glucose. Photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs harness
energy from the sun and from inorganic chemical compounds, respectively, to covalently bond carbon atoms
together into reduced organic compounds whose energy can be later accessed through the processes of respiration
and fermentation (Figure 8.24).

Nuclear RbcS Antisense Plants." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101 no. 16
(2004):6315-6320.
310  8 · Microbial Metabolism

     Overall, there is a constant exchange of CO2 between the heterotrophs (which produce CO2 as a result of respiration
     or fermentation) and the autotrophs (which use the CO2 for fixation). Autotrophs also respire or ferment, consuming
     the organic molecules they form; they do not fix carbon for heterotrophs, but rather use it for their own metabolic
     needs.

     Bacteria and archaea that use methane as their carbon source are called methanotrophs. Reduced one-carbon
     compounds like methane accumulate in certain anaerobic environments when CO2 is used as a terminal electron
     acceptor in anaerobic respiration by archaea called methanogens. Some methanogens also ferment acetate (two
     carbons) to produce methane and CO2. Methane accumulation due to methanogenesis occurs in both natural
     anaerobic soil and aquatic environments; methane accumulation also occurs as a result of animal husbandry
     because methanogens are members of the normal microbiota of ruminants. Environmental methane accumulation
     due to methanogenesis is of consequence because it is a strong greenhouse gas, and methanotrophs help to reduce
     atmospheric methane levels.

     Nitrogen Cycle

     Many biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, contain nitrogen; however, getting nitrogen
     into living organisms is difficult. Prokaryotes play essential roles in the nitrogen cycle (Figure 8.25), transforming
     nitrogen between various forms for their own needs, benefiting other organisms indirectly. Plants and phytoplankton
     cannot incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (where it exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent N2), even though
     this molecule composes approximately 78% of the atmosphere. Nitrogen enters the living world through free-living
     and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through specialized biochemical

pathways called nitrogen fixation. Cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems fix inorganic nitrogen (from nitrogen gas)
into ammonia (NH3) that can be easily incorporated into biological macromolecules. Rhizobium bacteria (Figure 8.1)
also fix nitrogen and live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as beans, peanuts, and peas), providing
them with needed organic nitrogen while receiving fixed carbon as sugar in exchange. Free-living bacteria, such as
members of the genus Azotobacter, are also able to fix nitrogen.

The nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is eventually converted from organic nitrogen back into

nitrogen gas by microbes through three steps: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. In terrestrial

systems, the first step is the ammonification process, in which certain bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste

from living animals or from the remains of dead organisms into ammonia (NH3). This ammonia is then oxidized to

nitrite  then to nitrate  by nitrifying soil bacteria such as members of the genus Nitrosomonas,

through the process of nitrification. Last, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby soil bacteria, such as

members of the genera Pseudomonas and Clostridium, use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic

respiration, converting it into nitrogen gas that reenters the atmosphere. A similar process occurs in the marine

nitrogen cycle, where these three processes are performed by marine bacteria and archaea.

Human activity releases nitrogen into the environment by the use of artificial fertilizers that contain nitrogen and
phosphorus compounds, which are then washed into lakes, rivers, and streams by surface runoff. A major effect
from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, in which nutrient runoff causes the overgrowth and
subsequent death of aquatic algae, making water sources anaerobic and inhospitable for the survival of aquatic
organisms.

     Sulfur Cycle

     Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living organisms. As part of the amino acids cysteine and

     methionine, it is involved in the formation of proteins. It is also found in several vitamins necessary for the synthesis

     of important biological molecules like coenzyme A. Several groups of microbes are responsible for carrying out

     processes involved in the sulfur cycle (Figure 8.26). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as

     chemoautotrophic archaea and bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor, oxidizing it first to elemental

     sulfur (S0), then to sulfate    This leads to stratification of hydrogen sulfide in soil, with levels increasing at

     deeper, more anaerobic depths.

     Many bacteria and plants can use sulfate as a sulfur source. Decomposition dead organisms by fungi and bacteria
     remove sulfur groups from amino acids, producing hydrogen sulfide, returning inorganic sulfur to the environment.

chemistry, with prokaryotes playing roles in both oxidation and reduction. Several other elements undergo chemical
cycles that do not involve redox chemistry. Examples of these are phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and silica (Si)
cycles. The cycling of these elements is particularly important in oceans because large quantities of these elements
are incorporated into the exoskeletons of marine organisms. These biogeochemical cycles do not involve redox
chemistry but instead involve fluctuations in the solubility of compounds containing calcium, phosphorous, and
silica. The overgrowth of naturally occurring microbial communities is typically limited by the availability of nitrogen
(as previously mentioned), phosphorus, and iron. Human activities introducing excessive amounts of iron, nitrogen,
or phosphorus (typically from detergents) may lead to eutrophication.

Bioremediation

Microbial bioremediation leverages microbial metabolism to remove xenobiotics or other pollutants. Xenobiotics
are compounds synthesized by humans and introduced into the environment in much higher concentrations than
would naturally occur. Such environmental contamination may involve adhesives, dyes, flame retardants, lubricants,
oil and petroleum products, organic solvents, pesticides, and products of the combustion of gasoline and oil. Many
xenobiotics resist breakdown, and some accumulate in the food chain after being consumed or absorbed by fish and
wildlife, which, in turn, may be eaten by humans. Of particular concern are contaminants like polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH), a carcinogenic xenobiotic found in crude oil, and trichloroethylene (TCE), a common
groundwater contaminant.

Bioremediation processes can be categorized as in situ or ex situ. Bioremediation conducted at the site of
contamination is called in situ bioremediation and does not involve movement of contaminated material. In
contrast, ex situ bioremediation involves the removal of contaminated material from the original site so that it can
be treated elsewhere, typically in a large, lined pit where conditions are optimized for degradation of the
contaminant.

Some bioremediation processes rely on microorganisms that are indigenous to the contaminated site or material.
Enhanced bioremediation techniques, which may be applied to either in situ or ex situ processing, involve the
addition of nutrients and/or air to encourage the growth of pollution-degrading microbes; they may also involve the
addition of non-native microbes known for their ability to degrade contaminants. For example, certain bacteria of
the genera Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas are known for their ability to degrade many environmental
contaminants, including aromatic compounds like those found in oil, down to CO2. The genes encoding their
degradatory enzymes are commonly found on plasmids. Others, like Alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants
that are useful in the solubilization of the hydrophobic molecules found in oil, making them more accessible to other
microbes for degradation.

Although there is a DNA test specific for Neisseria meningitidis, it is not practical for use in some developing
countries because it requires expensive equipment and a high level of expertise to perform. The hospital in
Banjul was not equipped to perform DNA testing. Biochemical testing, however, is much less expensive and is
still effective for microbial identification.

Fortunately for Hannah, her symptoms began to resolve with antibiotic therapy. Patients who survive bacterial
meningitis often suffer from long-term complications such as brain damage, hearing loss, and seizures, but after
several weeks of recovery, Hannah did not seem to be exhibiting any long-term effects and her behavior
returned to normal. Because of her age, her parents were advised to monitor her closely for any signs of
developmental issues and have her regularly evaluated by her pediatrician.

     N. meningitidis is found in the normal respiratory microbiota in 10%-20% of the human population.2 In most
     cases, it does not cause disease, but for reasons not fully understood, the bacterium can sometimes invade the
     bloodstream and cause infections in other areas of the body, including the brain. The disease is more common in
     infants and children, like Hannah.

     The prevalence of meningitis caused by N. meningitidis is particularly high in the so-called meningitis belt, a
     region of sub-Saharan African that includes 26 countries stretching from Senegal to Ethiopia (Figure 8.27). The
     reasons for this high prevalence are not clear, but several factors may contribute to higher rates of transmission,
     such as the dry, dusty climate; overcrowding and low standards of living; and the relatively low
     immunocompetence and nutritional status of the population.3 A vaccine against four bacterial strains of N.
     meningitidis is available. Vaccination is recommended for 11- and 12-year-old children, with a booster at age 16
     years. Vaccination is also recommended for young people who live in close quarters with others (e.g., college
     dormitories, military barracks), where the disease is more easily transmitted. Travelers visiting the "meningitis

INTRODUCTION We are all familiar with the slimy layer on a pond surface or that makes rocks slippery. These are
examples of biofilms--microorganisms embedded in thin layers of matrix material (Figure 9.1). Biofilms were long
considered random assemblages of cells and had little attention from researchers. Recently, progress in
visualization and biochemical methods has revealed that biofilms are an organized ecosystem within which many
cells, usually of different species of bacteria, fungi, and algae, interact through cell signaling and coordinated
responses. The biofilm provides a protected environment in harsh conditions and aids colonization by
microorganisms. Biofilms also have clinical importance. They form on medical devices, resist routine cleaning and
sterilization, and cause health-acquired infections. Within the body, biofilms form on the teeth as plaque, in the
lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, and on the cardiac tissue of patients with endocarditis. The slime layer helps
protect the cells from host immune defenses and antibiotic treatments.
Biofilms don't only exist on Earth. They have been frequent occupants (and problems) on the International Space
Station. Bacterial and fungal biofilms grow on a number of space station objects and within systems. In some cases,
growth has been so significant that hoses and other components had to be completely replaced. While this is
difficult on the ISS, it poses even greater risk for longer-range travel planned for the future. As described later in the
chapter, a group of scientists has devised a method to prevent growth of biofilms through surface preparation:
reducing the ability of the microorganisms to adhere to materials.
Studying biofilms requires new approaches. Because of the cells' adhesion properties, many of the methods for
culturing and counting cells that are explored in this chapter are not easily applied to biofilms. This is the beginning
of a new era of challenges and rewarding insight into the ways that microorganisms grow and thrive in nature.

       Jeni, a 24-year-old pregnant woman in her second trimester, visits a clinic with complaints of high fever, 38.9 °C
       (102 °F), fatigue, and muscle aches--typical flu-like signs and symptoms. Jeni exercises regularly and follows a
       nutritious diet with emphasis on organic foods, including raw milk that she purchases from a local farmer's
       market. All of her immunizations are up to date. However, the health-care provider who sees Jeni is concerned
       and orders a blood sample to be sent for testing by the microbiology laboratory.

     The bacterial cell cycle involves the formation of new cells through the replication of DNA and partitioning of cellular
     components into two daughter cells. In prokaryotes, reproduction is always asexual, although extensive genetic
     recombination in the form of horizontal gene transfer takes place, as will be explored in a different chapter. Most
     bacteria have a single circular chromosome; however, some exceptions exist. For example, Borrelia burgdorferi, the
     causative agent of Lyme disease, has a linear chromosome.

     Binary Fission

     The most common mechanism of cell replication in bacteria is a process called binary fission, which is depicted in
     Figure 9.2. Before dividing, the cell grows and increases its number of cellular components. Next, the replication of
     DNA starts at a location on the circular chromosome called the origin of replication, where the chromosome is
     attached to the inner cell membrane. Replication continues in opposite directions along the chromosome until the
     terminus is reached.

     The center of the enlarged cell constricts until two daughter cells are formed, each offspring receiving a complete
     copy of the parental genome and a division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). This process of cytokinesis and cell
     division is directed by a protein called FtsZ. FtsZ assembles into a Z ring on the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 9.3).
     The Z ring is anchored by FtsZ-binding proteins and defines the division plane between the two daughter cells.
     Additional proteins required for cell division are added to the Z ring to form a structure called the divisome. The
     divisome activates to produce a peptidoglycan cell wall and build a septum that divides the two daughter cells. The
     daughter cells are separated by the division septum, where all of the cells' outer layers (the cell wall and outer
     membranes, if present) must be remodeled to complete division. For example, we know that specific enzymes break
     bonds between the monomers in peptidoglycans and allow addition of new subunits along the division septum.

Generation Time

In eukaryotic organisms, the generation time is the time between the same points of the life cycle in two successive
generations. For example, the typical generation time for the human population is 25 years. This definition is not
practical for bacteria, which may reproduce rapidly or remain dormant for thousands of years. In prokaryotes
(Bacteria and Archaea), the generation time is also called the doubling time and is defined as the time it takes for
the population to double through one round of binary fission. Bacterial doubling times vary enormously. Whereas
Escherichia coli can double in as little as 20 minutes under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, bacteria of
326  9 · Microbial Growth

     the same species may need several days to double in especially harsh environments. Most pathogens grow rapidly,
     like E. coli, but there are exceptions. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis,
     has a generation time of between 15 and 20 hours. On the other hand, M. leprae, which causes Hansen's disease
     (leprosy), grows much more slowly, with a doubling time of 14 days.

     Calculating Number of Cells

     It is possible to predict the number of cells in a population when they divide by binary fission at a constant rate. As
     an example, consider what happens if a single cell divides every 30 minutes for 24 hours. The diagram in Figure 9.4
     shows the increase in cell numbers for the first three generations.

     The number of cells increases exponentially and can be expressed as 2n, where n is the number of generations. If
     cells divide every 30 minutes, after 24 hours, 48 divisions would have taken place. If we apply the formula 2n, where
     n is equal to 48, the single cell would give rise to 248 or 281,474,976,710,656 cells at 48 generations (24 hours).
     When dealing with such huge numbers, it is more practical to use scientific notation. Therefore, we express the
     number of cells as 2.8 × 1014 cells.

     In our example, we used one cell as the initial number of cells. For any number of starting cells, the formula is
     adapted as follows:

     Nn is the number of cells at any generation n, N0 is the initial number of cells, and n is the number of generations.

     FIGURE 9.4 The parental cell divides and gives rise to two daughter cells. Each of the daughter cells, in turn, divides, giving a total of four
     cells in the second generation and eight cells in the third generation. Each division doubles the number of cells.

     The Growth Curve

     Microorganisms grown in closed culture (also known as a batch culture), in which no nutrients are added and most
     waste is not removed, follow a reproducible growth pattern referred to as the growth curve. An example of a batch
     culture in nature is a pond in which a small number of cells grow in a closed environment. The culture density is

9.1 · How Microbes Grow                                                                                                                        327

defined as the number of cells per unit volume. In a closed environment, the culture density is also a measure of the
number of cells in the population. Infections of the body do not always follow the growth curve, but correlations can
exist depending upon the site and type of infection. When the number of live cells is plotted against time, distinct
phases can be observed in the curve (Figure 9.5).

FIGURE 9.5 The growth curve of a bacterial culture is represented by the logarithm of the number of live cells plotted as a function of time.
The graph can be divided into four phases according to the slope, each of which matches events in the cell. The four phases are lag, log,
stationary, and death.

The Lag Phase
The beginning of the growth curve represents a small number of cells, referred to as an inoculum, that are added to
a fresh culture medium, a nutritional broth that supports growth. The initial phase of the growth curve is called the
lag phase, during which cells are gearing up for the next phase of growth. The number of cells does not change
during the lag phase; however, cells grow larger and are metabolically active, synthesizing proteins needed to grow
within the medium. If any cells were damaged or shocked during the transfer to the new medium, repair takes place
during the lag phase. The duration of the lag phase is determined by many factors, including the species and genetic
make-up of the cells, the composition of the medium, and the size of the original inoculum.

The Log Phase
In the logarithmic (log) growth phase, sometimes called exponential growth phase, the cells are actively dividing
by binary fission and their number increases exponentially. For any given bacterial species, the generation time
under specific growth conditions (nutrients, temperature, pH, and so forth) is genetically determined, and this
generation time is called the intrinsic growth rate. During the log phase, the relationship between time and number
of cells is not linear but exponential; however, the growth curve is often plotted on a semilogarithmic graph, as
shown in Figure 9.6, which gives the appearance of a linear relationship.
328  9 · Microbial Growth

     FIGURE 9.6 Both graphs illustrate population growth during the log phase for a bacterial sample with an initial population of one cell and a
     doubling time of 1 hour. (a) When plotted on an arithmetic scale, the growth rate resembles a curve. (b) When plotted on a semilogarithmic
     scale (meaning the values on the y-axis are logarithmic), the growth rate appears linear.

     Cells in the log phase show constant growth rate and uniform metabolic activity. For this reason, cells in the log
     phase are preferentially used for industrial applications and research work. The log phase is also the stage where
     bacteria are the most susceptible to the action of disinfectants and common antibiotics that affect protein, DNA, and
     cell-wall synthesis.

     Stationary Phase
     As the number of cells increases through the log phase, several factors contribute to a slowing of the growth rate.
     Waste products accumulate and nutrients are gradually used up. In addition, gradual depletion of oxygen begins to
     limit aerobic cell growth. This combination of unfavorable conditions slows and finally stalls population growth. The
     total number of live cells reaches a plateau referred to as the stationary phase (Figure 9.5). In this phase, the
     number of new cells created by cell division is now equivalent to the number of cells dying; thus, the total
     population of living cells is relatively stagnant. The culture density in a stationary culture is constant. The culture's
     carrying capacity, or maximum culture density, depends on the types of microorganisms in the culture and the
     specific conditions of the culture; however, carrying capacity is constant for a given organism grown under the same
     conditions.

     During the stationary phase, cells switch to a survival mode of metabolism. As growth slows, so too does the
     synthesis of peptidoglycans, proteins, and nucleic-acids; thus, stationary cultures are less susceptible to antibiotics
     that disrupt these processes. In bacteria capable of producing endospores, many cells undergo sporulation during
     the stationary phase. Secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, are synthesized in the stationary phase. In
     certain pathogenic bacteria, the stationary phase is also associated with the expression of virulence factors,
     products that contribute to a microbe's ability to survive, reproduce, and cause disease in a host organism. For
     example, quorum sensing in Staphylococcus aureus initiates the production of enzymes that can break down human
     tissue and cellular debris, clearing the way for bacteria to spread to new tissue where nutrients are more plentiful.

     The Death Phase
     As a culture medium accumulates toxic waste and nutrients are exhausted, cells die in greater and greater numbers.
     Soon, the number of dying cells exceeds the number of dividing cells, leading to an exponential decrease in the
     number of cells (Figure 9.5). This is the aptly named death phase, sometimes called the decline phase. Many cells
     lyse and release nutrients into the medium, allowing surviving cells to maintain viability and form endospores. A few
     cells, the so-called persisters, are characterized by a slow metabolic rate. Persister cells are medically important
     because they are associated with certain chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, that do not respond to antibiotic
     treatment.

     Sustaining Microbial Growth
     The growth pattern shown in Figure 9.5 takes place in a closed environment; nutrients are not added and waste and

dead cells are not removed. In many cases, though, it is advantageous to maintain cells in the logarithmic phase of
growth. One example is in industries that harvest microbial products. A chemostat (Figure 9.7) is used to maintain a
continuous culture in which nutrients are supplied at a steady rate. A controlled amount of air is mixed in for aerobic
processes. Bacterial suspension is removed at the same rate as nutrients flow in to maintain an optimal growth
environment.

FIGURE 9.7 A chemostat is a culture vessel fitted with an opening to add nutrients (feed) and an outlet to remove contents (effluent),
effectively diluting toxic wastes and dead cells. The addition and removal of fluids is adjusted to maintain the culture in the logarithmic
phase of growth. If aerobic bacteria are grown, suitable oxygen levels are maintained.

Measurement of Bacterial Growth

Estimating the number of bacterial cells in a sample, known as a bacterial count, is a common task performed by
microbiologists. The number of bacteria in a clinical sample serves as an indication of the extent of an infection.
Quality control of drinking water, food, medication, and even cosmetics relies on estimates of bacterial counts to
detect contamination and prevent the spread of disease. Two major approaches are used to measure cell number.
The direct methods involve counting cells, whereas the indirect methods depend on the measurement of cell
presence or activity without actually counting individual cells. Both direct and indirect methods have advantages
and disadvantages for specific applications.

Direct Cell Count
Direct cell count refers to counting the cells in a liquid culture or colonies on a plate. It is a direct way of estimating
how many organisms are present in a sample. Let's look first at a simple and fast method that requires only a
specialized slide and a compound microscope.

The simplest way to count bacteria is called the direct microscopic cell count, which involves transferring a known
volume of a culture to a calibrated slide and counting the cells under a light microscope. The calibrated slide is
called a Petroff-Hausser chamber (Figure 9.8) and is similar to a hemocytometer used to count red blood cells. The
central area of the counting chamber is etched into squares of various sizes. A sample of the culture suspension is
added to the chamber under a coverslip that is placed at a specific height from the surface of the grid. It is possible
to estimate the concentration of cells in the original sample by counting individual cells in a number of squares and
determining the volume of the sample observed. The area of the squares and the height at which the coverslip is
positioned are specified for the chamber. The concentration must be corrected for dilution if the sample was diluted
before enumeration.
330  9 · Microbial Growth

     FIGURE 9.8 (a) A Petroff-Hausser chamber is a special slide designed for counting the bacterial cells in a measured volume of a sample. A
     grid is etched on the slide to facilitate precision in counting. (b) This diagram illustrates the grid of a Petroff-Hausser chamber, which is
     made up of squares of known areas. The enlarged view shows the square within which bacteria (red cells) are counted. If the coverslip is
     0.2 mm above the grid and the square has an area of 0.04 mm2, then the volume is 0.008 mm3, or 0.000008 mL. Since there are 10 cells
     inside the square, the density of bacteria is 10 cells/0.000008 mL, which equates to 1,250,000 cells/mL. (credit a: modification of work by
     Jeffrey M. Vinocur)

     Cells in several small squares must be counted and the average taken to obtain a reliable measurement. The
     advantages of the chamber are that the method is easy to use, relatively fast, and inexpensive. On the downside, the
     counting chamber does not work well with dilute cultures because there may not be enough cells to count.
     Using a counting chamber does not necessarily yield an accurate count of the number of live cells because it is not
     always possible to distinguish between live cells, dead cells, and debris of the same size under the microscope.
     However, newly developed fluorescence staining techniques make it possible to distinguish viable and dead
     bacteria. These viability stains (or live stains) bind to nucleic acids, but the primary and secondary stains differ in
     their ability to cross the cytoplasmic membrane. The primary stain, which fluoresces green, can penetrate intact
     cytoplasmic membranes, staining both live and dead cells. The secondary stain, which fluoresces red, can stain a
     cell only if the cytoplasmic membrane is considerably damaged. Thus, live cells fluoresce green because they only
     absorb the green stain, whereas dead cells appear red because the red stain displaces the green stain on their
     nucleic acids (Figure 9.9).

     FIGURE 9.9 Fluorescence staining can be used to differentiate between viable and dead bacterial cells in a sample for purposes of
     counting. Viable cells are stained green, whereas dead cells are stained red. (credit: modification of work by Emerson J, Adams R,
     Bentancourt Román C, Brooks B, Coil D, Dahlhousen K, Ganz H, et al.)

     Another technique uses an electronic cell counting device (Coulter counter) to detect and count the changes in
     electrical resistance in a saline solution. A glass tube with a small opening is immersed in an electrolyte solution. A
     first electrode is suspended in the glass tube. A second electrode is located outside of the tube. As cells are drawn
     through the small aperture in the glass tube, they briefly change the resistance measured between the two
     electrodes and the change is recorded by an electronic sensor (Figure 9.10); each resistance change represents a
     cell. The method is rapid and accurate within a range of concentrations; however, if the culture is too concentrated,
     more than one cell may pass through the aperture at any given time and skew the results. This method also does not
     differentiate between live and dead cells.
     Direct counts provide an estimate of the total number of cells in a sample. However, in many situations, it is

important to know the number of live, or viable, cells. Counts of live cells are needed when assessing the extent of
an infection, the effectiveness of antimicrobial compounds and medication, or contamination of food and water.

Plate Count

The viable plate count, or simply plate count, is a count of viable or live cells. It is based on the principle that viable
cells replicate and give rise to visible colonies when incubated under suitable conditions for the specimen. The
results are usually expressed as colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) rather than cells per milliliter because
more than one cell may have landed on the same spot to give rise to a single colony. Furthermore, samples of
bacteria that grow in clusters or chains are difficult to disperse and a single colony may represent several cells.
Some cells are described as viable but nonculturable and will not form colonies on solid media. For all these
reasons, the viable plate count is considered a low estimate of the actual number of live cells. These limitations do
not detract from the usefulness of the method, which provides estimates of live bacterial numbers.

Microbiologists typically count plates with 30-300 colonies. Samples with too few colonies (<30) do not give
statistically reliable numbers, and overcrowded plates (>300 colonies) make it difficult to accurately count
individual colonies. Also, counts in this range minimize occurrences of more than one bacterial cell forming a single
colony. Thus, the calculated CFU is closer to the true number of live bacteria in the population.

There are two common approaches to inoculating plates for viable counts: the pour plate and the spread plate
methods. Although the final inoculation procedure differs between these two methods, they both start with a serial
dilution of the culture.

Serial Dilution
The serial dilution of a culture is an important first step before proceeding to either the pour plate or spread plate
method. The goal of the serial dilution process is to obtain plates with CFUs in the range of 30-300, and the process
usually involves several dilutions in multiples of 10 to simplify calculation. The number of serial dilutions is chosen
according to a preliminary estimate of the culture density. Figure 9.11 illustrates the serial dilution method.

A fixed volume of the original culture, 1.0 mL, is added to and thoroughly mixed with the first dilution tube solution,
332  9 · Microbial Growth

     which contains 9.0 mL of sterile broth. This step represents a dilution factor of 10, or 1:10, compared with the
     original culture. From this first dilution, the same volume, 1.0 mL, is withdrawn and mixed with a fresh tube of 9.0
     mL of dilution solution. The dilution factor is now 1:100 compared with the original culture. This process continues
     until a series of dilutions is produced that will bracket the desired cell concentration for accurate counting. From
     each tube, a sample is plated on solid medium using either the pour plate method (Figure 9.12) or the spread plate
     method (Figure 9.13). The plates are incubated until colonies appear. Two to three plates are usually prepared from
     each dilution and the numbers of colonies counted on each plate are averaged. In all cases, thorough mixing of
     samples with the dilution medium (to ensure the cell distribution in the tube is random) is paramount to obtaining
     reliable results.

     FIGURE 9.11 Serial dilution involves diluting a fixed volume of cells mixed with dilution solution using the previous dilution as an inoculum.
     The result is dilution of the original culture by an exponentially growing factor. (credit: modification of work by "Leberechtc"/Wikimedia
     Commons)

     The dilution factor is used to calculate the number of cells in the original cell culture. In our example, an average of
     50 colonies was counted on the plates obtained from the 1:10,000 dilution. Because only 0.1 mL of suspension was
     pipetted on the plate, the multiplier required to reconstitute the original concentration is 10 × 10,000. The number
     of CFU per mL is equal to 50 × 10 × 10,000 = 5,000,000. The number of bacteria in the culture is estimated as 5
     million cells/mL. The colony count obtained from the 1:1000 dilution was 389, well below the expected 500 for a
     10-fold difference in dilutions. This highlights the issue of inaccuracy when colony counts are greater than 300 and
     more than one bacterial cell grows into a single colony.

and further mixed by swirling. This process is repeated for each serial dilution prepared. The resulting colonies are counted and provide an
estimate of the number of cells in the original volume sampled.

FIGURE 9.13 In the spread plate method of cell counting, the sample is poured onto solid agar and then spread using a sterile spreader.
This process is repeated for each serial dilution prepared. The resulting colonies are counted and provide an estimate of the number of cells
in the original volume samples.

A very dilute sample--drinking water, for example--may not contain enough organisms to use either of the plate
count methods described. In such cases, the original sample must be concentrated rather than diluted before
plating. This can be accomplished using a modification of the plate count technique called the membrane filtration
technique. Known volumes are vacuum-filtered aseptically through a membrane with a pore size small enough to
trap microorganisms. The membrane is transferred to a Petri plate containing an appropriate growth medium.
Colonies are counted after incubation. Calculation of the cell density is made by dividing the cell count by the
volume of filtered liquid.

The Most Probable Number
The number of microorganisms in dilute samples is usually too low to be detected by the plate count methods
described thus far. For these specimens, microbiologists routinely use the most probable number (MPN) method, a
statistical procedure for estimating of the number of viable microorganisms in a sample. Often used for water and
food samples, the MPN method evaluates detectable growth by observing changes in turbidity or color due to
metabolic activity.

A typical application of MPN method is the estimation of the number of coliforms in a sample of pond water.
Coliforms are gram-negative rod bacteria that ferment lactose. The presence of coliforms in water is considered a
sign of contamination by fecal matter. For the method illustrated in Figure 9.14, a series of three dilutions of the
water sample is tested by inoculating five lactose broth tubes with 10 mL of sample, five lactose broth tubes with 1
mL of sample, and five lactose broth tubes with 0.1 mL of sample. The lactose broth tubes contain a pH indicator
that changes color from red to yellow when the lactose is fermented. After inoculation and incubation, the tubes are
examined for an indication of coliform growth by a color change in media from red to yellow. The first set of tubes
(10-mL sample) showed growth in all the tubes; the second set of tubes (1 mL) showed growth in two tubes out of
five; in the third set of tubes, no growth is observed in any of the tubes (0.1-mL dilution). The numbers 5, 2, and 0
are compared with Figure B1 in Appendix B, which has been constructed using a probability model of the sampling
procedure. From our reading of the table, we conclude that 49 is the most probable number of bacteria per 100 mL

     Indirect Cell Counts

     Besides direct methods of counting cells, other methods, based on an indirect detection of cell density, are
     commonly used to estimate and compare cell densities in a culture. The foremost approach is to measure the
     turbidity (cloudiness) of a sample of bacteria in a liquid suspension. The laboratory instrument used to measure
     turbidity is called a spectrophotometer (Figure 9.15). In a spectrophotometer, a light beam is transmitted through a
     bacterial suspension, the light passing through the suspension is measured by a detector, and the amount of light
     passing through the sample and reaching the detector is converted to either percent transmission or a logarithmic
     value called absorbance (optical density). As the numbers of bacteria in a suspension increase, the turbidity also
     increases and causes less light to reach the detector. The decrease in light passing through the sample and reaching
     the detector is associated with a decrease in percent transmission and increase in absorbance measured by the
     spectrophotometer.
     Measuring turbidity is a fast method to estimate cell density as long as there are enough cells in a sample to
     produce turbidity. It is possible to correlate turbidity readings to the actual number of cells by performing a viable
     plate count of samples taken from cultures having a range of absorbance values. Using these values, a calibration
     curve is generated by plotting turbidity as a function of cell density. Once the calibration curve has been produced, it
     can be used to estimate cell counts for all samples obtained or cultured under similar conditions and with densities
     within the range of values used to construct the curve.

FIGURE 9.15 (a) A spectrophotometer is commonly used to measure the turbidity of a bacterial cell suspension as an indirect measure of
cell density. (b) A spectrophotometer works by splitting white light from a source into a spectrum. The spectrophotometer allows choice of
the wavelength of light to use for the measurement. The optical density (turbidity) of the sample will depend on the wavelength, so once
one wavelength is chosen, it must be used consistently. The filtered light passes through the sample (or a control with only medium) and
the light intensity is measured by a detector. The light passing into a suspension of bacteria is scattered by the cells in such a way that
some fraction of it never reaches the detector. This scattering happens to a far lesser degree in the control tube with only the medium.

Measuring dry weight of a culture sample is another indirect method of evaluating culture density without directly
measuring cell counts. The cell suspension used for weighing must be concentrated by filtration or centrifugation,
washed, and then dried before the measurements are taken. The degree of drying must be standardized to account
for residual water content. This method is especially useful for filamentous microorganisms, which are difficult to
enumerate by direct or viable plate count.

As we have seen, methods to estimate viable cell numbers can be labor intensive and take time because cells must
be grown. Recently, indirect ways of measuring live cells have been developed that are both fast and easy to
implement. These methods measure cell activity by following the production of metabolic products or
disappearance of reactants. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation, biosynthesis of proteins and nucleic acids,
and consumption of oxygen can all be monitored to estimate the number of cells.

Alternative Patterns of Cell Division

Binary fission is the most common pattern of cell division in prokaryotes, but it is not the only one. Other
mechanisms usually involve asymmetrical division (as in budding) or production of spores in aerial filaments.

In some cyanobacteria, many nucleoids may accumulate in an enlarged round cell or along a filament, leading to the
generation of many new cells at once. The new cells often split from the parent filament and float away in a process
called fragmentation (Figure 9.16). Fragmentation is commonly observed in the Actinomycetes, a group of gram-
positive, anaerobic bacteria commonly found in soil. Another curious example of cell division in prokaryotes,
reminiscent of live birth in animals, is exhibited by the giant bacterium Epulopiscium. Several daughter cells grow
fully in the parent cell, which eventually disintegrates, releasing the new cells to the environment. Other species
may form a long narrow extension at one pole in a process called budding. The tip of the extension swells and forms
a smaller cell, the bud that eventually detaches from the parent cell. Budding is most common in yeast (Figure
9.16), but it is also observed in prosthecate bacteria and some cyanobacteria.

     The soil bacteria Actinomyces grow in long filaments divided by septa, similar to the mycelia seen in fungi, resulting
     in long cells with multiple nucleoids. Environmental signals, probably related to low nutrient availability, lead to the
     formation of aerial filaments. Within these aerial filaments, elongated cells divide simultaneously. The new cells,
     which contain a single nucleoid, develop into spores that give rise to new colonies.

     Biofilms

     In nature, microorganisms grow mainly in biofilms, complex and dynamic ecosystems that form on a variety of
     environmental surfaces, from industrial conduits and water treatment pipelines to rocks in river beds. Biofilms are
     not restricted to solid surface substrates, however. Almost any surface in a liquid environment containing some
     minimal nutrients will eventually develop a biofilm. Microbial mats that float on water, for example, are biofilms that
     contain large populations of photosynthetic microorganisms. Biofilms found in the human mouth may contain
     hundreds of bacterial species. Regardless of the environment where they occur, biofilms are not random collections
     of microorganisms; rather, they are highly structured communities that provide a selective advantage to their
     constituent microorganisms.

     Biofilm Structure
     Observations using confocal microscopy have shown that environmental conditions influence the overall structure
     of biofilms. Filamentous biofilms called streamers form in rapidly flowing water, such as freshwater streams, eddies,
     and specially designed laboratory flow cells that replicate growth conditions in fast-moving fluids. The streamers are
     anchored to the substrate by a "head" and the "tail" floats downstream in the current. In still or slow-moving water,
     biofilms mainly assume a mushroom-like shape. The structure of biofilms may also change with other
     environmental conditions such as nutrient availability.

     Detailed observations of biofilms under confocal laser and scanning electron microscopes reveal clusters of
     microorganisms embedded in a matrix interspersed with open water channels. The extracellular matrix consists of
     extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by the organisms in the biofilm. The extracellular matrix
     represents a large fraction of the biofilm, accounting for 50%-90% of the total dry mass. The properties of the EPS
     vary according to the resident organisms and environmental conditions.

     EPS is a hydrated gel composed primarily of polysaccharides and containing other macromolecules such as
     proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. It plays a key role in maintaining the integrity and function of the biofilm.
     Channels in the EPS allow movement of nutrients, waste, and gases throughout the biofilm. This keeps the cells
     hydrated, preventing desiccation. EPS also shelters organisms in the biofilm from predation by other microbes or
     cells (e.g., protozoans, white blood cells in the human body).

Biofilm Formation
Free-floating microbial cells that live in an aquatic environment are called planktonic cells. The formation of a
biofilm essentially involves the attachment of planktonic cells to a substrate, where they become sessile (attached
to a surface). This occurs in stages, as depicted in Figure 9.17. The first stage involves the attachment of planktonic
cells to a surface coated with a conditioning film of organic material. At this point, attachment to the substrate is
reversible, but as cells express new phenotypes that facilitate the formation of EPS, they transition from a
planktonic to a sessile lifestyle. The biofilm develops characteristic structures, including an extensive matrix and
water channels. Appendages such as fimbriae, pili, and flagella interact with the EPS, and microscopy and genetic
analysis suggest that such structures are required for the establishment of a mature biofilm. In the last stage of the
biofilm life cycle, cells on the periphery of the biofilm revert to a planktonic lifestyle, sloughing off the mature biofilm
to colonize new sites. This stage is referred to as dispersal.

FIGURE 9.17 Stages in the formation and life cycle of a biofilm. (credit: modification of work by Public Library of Science and American
Society for Microbiology)

Within a biofilm, different species of microorganisms establish metabolic collaborations in which the waste product
of one organism becomes the nutrient for another. For example, aerobic microorganisms consume oxygen, creating
anaerobic regions that promote the growth of anaerobes. This occurs in many polymicrobial infections that involve
both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens.

The mechanism by which cells in a biofilm coordinate their activities in response to environmental stimuli is called
quorum sensing. Quorum sensing--which can occur between cells of different species within a biofilm--enables
microorganisms to detect their cell density through the release and binding of small, diffusible molecules called
autoinducers. When the cell population reaches a critical threshold (a quorum), these autoinducers initiate a
cascade of reactions that activate genes associated with cellular functions that are beneficial only when the
population reaches a critical density. For example, in some pathogens, synthesis of virulence factors only begins
when enough cells are present to overwhelm the immune defenses of the host. Although mostly studied in bacterial
populations, quorum sensing takes place between bacteria and eukaryotes and between eukaryotic cells such as
the fungus Candida albicans, a common member of the human microbiota that can cause infections in
immunocompromised individuals.

The signaling molecules in quorum sensing belong to two major classes. Gram-negative bacteria communicate
mainly using N-acylated homoserine lactones, whereas gram-positive bacteria mostly use small peptides (Figure
9.18). In all cases, the first step in quorum sensing consists of the binding of the autoinducer to its specific receptor
only when a threshold concentration of signaling molecules is reached. Once binding to the receptor takes place, a
cascade of signaling events leads to changes in gene expression. The result is the activation of biological responses
338  9 · Microbial Growth

     linked to quorum sensing, notably an increase in the production of signaling molecules themselves, hence the term
     autoinducer.

     FIGURE 9.18 Short peptides in gram-positive bacteria and N-acetylated homoserine lactones in gram-negative bacteria act as
     autoinducers in quorum sensing and mediate the coordinated response of bacterial cells. The R side chain of the N-acetylated homoserine
     lactone is specific for the species of gram-negative bacteria. Some secreted homoserine lactones are recognized by more than one species.

     Biofilms and Human Health
     The human body harbors many types of biofilms, some beneficial and some harmful. For example, the layers of
     normal microbiota lining the intestinal and respiratory mucosa play a role in warding off infections by pathogens.
     However, other biofilms in the body can have a detrimental effect on health. For example, the plaque that forms on
     teeth is a biofilm that can contribute to dental and periodontal disease. Biofilms can also form in wounds,
     sometimes causing serious infections that can spread. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa often colonizes
     biofilms in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis, causing chronic and sometimes fatal infections of the lungs.
     Biofilms can also form on medical devices used in or on the body, causing infections in patients with in-dwelling
     catheters, artificial joints, or contact lenses.

     Pathogens embedded within biofilms exhibit a higher resistance to antibiotics than their free-floating counterparts.
     Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why. Cells in the deep layers of a biofilm are metabolically
     inactive and may be less susceptible to the action of antibiotics that disrupt metabolic activities. The EPS may also
     slow the diffusion of antibiotics and antiseptics, preventing them from reaching cells in the deeper layers of the
     biofilm. Phenotypic changes may also contribute to the increased resistance exhibited by bacterial cells in biofilms.
     For example, the increased production of efflux pumps, membrane-embedded proteins that actively extrude
     antibiotics out of bacterial cells, have been shown to be an important mechanism of antibiotic resistance among
     biofilm-associated bacteria. Finally, biofilms provide an ideal environment for the exchange of extrachromosomal
     DNA, which often includes genes that confer antibiotic resistance.

     Biofilms forming on equipment such as filtration systems can compromise their performance and cause health risks.
     Components of CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, which are used to help people with sleep
     apnea, must be replaced periodically because of biofilm buildup. On the International Space Station, biofilms clog
     hoses and other portions of water reclamation and filtration systems -- critical elements to long-term survival in
     space. After years of effort, a 2023 discovery has significant implications for space travel and dwelling.

     Previous approaches to prevent biofilm build-up included treating surfaces with anti-bacterial substances. But
     researchers Pamela Flores at University of Colorado and Samantha McBride of MIT described in a 2023 paper, these
     often failed when a layer of dead biofilm cells forms and becomes an anchor point for subsequent biofilms to grow.
     Furthermore, rapid microbial adaptation leads to resistant strains, which may lead to even greater risks for crew and
     equipment. So, instead of killing microorganisms, McBride and Flores -- working with Kripa Varanasi (MIT), Luis Zea
     (U. of Colorado), and Jonathan Galazko (NASA) -- treated surfaces with a layer of lubricant, which was infused into
     the tiny crevices of the surface and held there by capillary action. Experiments on Earth and on the ISS showed that
     the lubrication was effective at preventing biofilm growth because it eliminated microorganism adhesion. Beyond
     space exploration applications, the approach may be used in medical and other devices.1

9.2 Oxygen Requirements for Microbial Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Interpret visual data demonstrating minimum, optimum, and maximum oxygen or carbon dioxide
        requirements for growth

    · Identify and describe different categories of microbes with requirements for growth with or without
        oxygen: obligate aerobe, obligate anaerobe, facultative anaerobe, aerotolerant anaerobe, microaerophile,
        and capnophile

    · Give examples of microorganisms for each category of growth requirements

Ask most people "What are the major requirements for life?" and the answers are likely to include water and
oxygen. Few would argue about the need for water, but what about oxygen? Can there be life without oxygen?

The answer is that molecular oxygen (O2) is not always needed. The earliest signs of life are dated to a period when

conditions on earth were highly reducing and free oxygen gas was essentially nonexistent. Only after cyanobacteria

started releasing oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis and the capacity of iron in the oceans for taking up

oxygen was exhausted did oxygen levels increase in the atmosphere. This event, often referred to as the Great

Oxygenation Event or the Oxygen Revolution, caused a massive extinction. Most organisms could not survive the

powerful oxidative properties of reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly unstable ions and molecules derived from

partial reduction of oxygen that can damage virtually any macromolecule or structure with which they come in

contact. Singlet oxygen (O2·), superoxide  peroxides (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH·), and hypochlorite ion

(OCl-), the active ingredient of household bleach, are all examples of ROS. The organisms that were able to detoxify

reactive oxygen species harnessed the high electronegativity of oxygen to produce free energy for their metabolism

and thrived in the new environment.

Oxygen Requirements of Microorganisms

Many ecosystems are still free of molecular oxygen. Some are found in extreme locations, such as deep in the ocean
or in earth's crust; others are part of our everyday landscape, such as marshes, bogs, and sewers. Within the bodies
of humans and other animals, regions with little or no oxygen provide an anaerobic environment for microorganisms.
(Figure 9.19).

FIGURE 9.19 Anaerobic environments are still common on earth. They include environments like (a) a bog where undisturbed dense
sediments are virtually devoid of oxygen, and (b) the rumen (the first compartment of a cow's stomach), which provides an oxygen-free
incubator for methanogens and other obligate anaerobic bacteria. (credit a: modification of work by National Park Service; credit b:
modification of work by US Department of Agriculture)

We can easily observe different requirements for molecular oxygen by growing bacteria in thioglycolate tube
cultures. A test-tube culture starts with autoclaved thioglycolate medium containing a low percentage of agar to
340  9 · Microbial Growth

     allow motile bacteria to move throughout the medium. Thioglycolate has strong reducing properties and autoclaving
     flushes out most of the oxygen. The tubes are inoculated with the bacterial cultures to be tested and incubated at an
     appropriate temperature. Over time, oxygen slowly diffuses throughout the thioglycolate tube culture from the top.
     Bacterial density increases in the area where oxygen concentration is best suited for the growth of that particular
     organism.

     The growth of bacteria with varying oxygen requirements in thioglycolate tubes is illustrated in Figure 9.20. In tube
     A, all the growth is seen at the top of the tube. The bacteria are obligate (strict) aerobes that cannot grow without
     an abundant supply of oxygen. Tube B looks like the opposite of tube A. Bacteria grow at the bottom of tube B.
     Those are obligate anaerobes, which are killed by oxygen. Tube C shows heavy growth at the top of the tube and
     growth throughout the tube, a typical result with facultative anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes are organisms that
     thrive in the presence of oxygen but also grow in its absence by relying on fermentation or anaerobic respiration, if
     there is a suitable electron acceptor other than oxygen and the organism is able to perform anaerobic respiration.
     The aerotolerant anaerobes in tube D are indifferent to the presence of oxygen. They do not use oxygen because
     they usually have a fermentative metabolism, but they are not harmed by the presence of oxygen as obligate
     anaerobes are. Tube E on the right shows a "Goldilocks" culture. The oxygen level has to be just right for growth, not
     too much and not too little. These microaerophiles are bacteria that require a minimum level of oxygen for growth,
     about 1%-10%, well below the 21% found in the atmosphere.

     Examples of obligate aerobes are Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis and Micrococcus
     luteus, a gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the skin. Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of severe
     bacterial meningitis, and N. gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of sexually transmitted gonorrhea, are also obligate
     aerobes.

                                                  FIGURE 9.20 Diagram of bacterial cell distribution in thioglycolate tubes.

     Many obligate anaerobes are found in the environment where anaerobic conditions exist, such as in deep sediments
     of soil, still waters, and at the bottom of the deep ocean where there is no photosynthetic life. Anaerobic conditions
     also exist naturally in the intestinal tract of animals. Obligate anaerobes, mainly Bacteroidetes, represent a large
     fraction of the microbes in the human gut. Transient anaerobic conditions exist when tissues are not supplied with
     blood circulation; they die and become an ideal breeding ground for obligate anaerobes. Another type of obligate
     anaerobe encountered in the human body is the gram-positive, rod-shaped Clostridium spp. Their ability to form
     endospores allows them to survive in the presence of oxygen. One of the major causes of health-acquired infections
     is C. difficile, known as C. diff. Prolonged use of antibiotics for other infections increases the probability of a patient
     developing a secondary C. difficile infection. Antibiotic treatment disrupts the balance of microorganisms in the
     intestine and allows the colonization of the gut by C. difficile, causing a significant inflammation of the colon.

     Other clostridia responsible for serious infections include C. tetani, the agent of tetanus, and C. perfringens, which
     causes gas gangrene. In both cases, the infection starts in necrotic tissue (dead tissue that is not supplied with
     oxygen by blood circulation). This is the reason that deep puncture wounds are associated with tetanus. When
     tissue death is accompanied by lack of circulation, gangrene is always a danger.

     The study of obligate anaerobes requires special equipment. Obligate anaerobic bacteria must be grown under
     conditions devoid of oxygen. The most common approach is culture in an anaerobic jar (Figure 9.21). Anaerobic jars

include chemical packs that remove oxygen and release carbon dioxide (CO2). An anaerobic chamber is an
enclosed box from which all oxygen is removed. Gloves sealed to openings in the box allow handling of the cultures
without exposing the culture to air (Figure 9.21).

box are sealed by glove-like sleeves that allow for the handling of cultures inside the box. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention; credit b: modification of work by NIST)

Staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae are examples of facultative anaerobes. Staphylococci are found on the skin
and upper respiratory tract. Enterobacteriaceae are found primarily in the gut and upper respiratory tract but can
sometimes spread to the urinary tract, where they are capable of causing infections. It is not unusual to see mixed
bacterial infections in which the facultative anaerobes use up the oxygen, creating an environment for the obligate
anaerobes to flourish.

Examples of aerotolerant anaerobes include lactobacilli and streptococci, both found in the oral microbiota.
Campylobacter jejuni, which causes gastrointestinal infections, is an example of a microaerophile and is grown
under low-oxygen conditions.

The optimum oxygen concentration, as the name implies, is the ideal concentration of oxygen for a particular
microorganism. The lowest concentration of oxygen that allows growth is called the minimum permissive oxygen
concentration. The highest tolerated concentration of oxygen is the maximum permissive oxygen concentration.
The organism will not grow outside the range of oxygen levels found between the minimum and maximum
permissive oxygen concentrations.

  CASE IN POINT

  An Unwelcome Anaerobe

  Charles is a retired bus driver who developed type 2 diabetes over 10 years ago. Since his retirement, his
  lifestyle has become very sedentary and he has put on a substantial amount of weight. Although he has felt
  tingling and numbness in his left foot for a while, he has not been worried because he thought his foot was
  simply "falling asleep." Recently, a scratch on his foot does not seem to be healing and is becoming increasingly
  ugly. Because the sore did not bother him much, Charles figured it could not be serious until his daughter
  noticed a purplish discoloration spreading on the skin and oozing (Figure 9.22). When he was finally seen by his
  physician, Charles was rushed to the operating room. His open sore, or ulcer, is the result of a diabetic foot.

  The concern here is that gas gangrene may have taken hold in the dead tissue. The most likely agent of gas
  gangrene is Clostridium perfringens, an endospore-forming, gram-positive bacterium. It is an obligate anaerobe
  that grows in tissue devoid of oxygen. Since dead tissue is no longer supplied with oxygen by the circulatory
342  9 · Microbial Growth

     system, the dead tissue provides pockets of ideal environment for the growth of C. perfringens.

     A surgeon examines the ulcer and radiographs of Charles's foot and determines that the bone is not yet infected.
     The wound will have to be surgically debrided (debridement refers to the removal of dead and infected tissue)
     and a sample sent for microbiological lab analysis, but Charles will not have to have his foot amputated. Many
     diabetic patients are not so lucky. In 2008, nearly 70,000 diabetic patients in the United States lost a foot or
     limb to amputation, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.2

     Detoxification of Reactive Oxygen Species

     Aerobic respiration constantly generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), byproducts that must be detoxified. Even
     organisms that do not use aerobic respiration need some way to break down some of the ROS that may form from
     atmospheric oxygen. Three main enzymes break down those toxic byproducts: superoxide dismutase, peroxidase,
     and catalase. Each one catalyzes a different reaction. Reactions of type seen in Reaction 1 are catalyzed by
     peroxidases.

     In these reactions, an electron donor (reduced compound; e.g., reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADH])
     oxidizes hydrogen peroxide, or other peroxides, to water. The enzymes play an important role by limiting the
     damage caused by peroxidation of membrane lipids. Reaction 2 is mediated by the enzyme superoxide dismutase
     (SOD) and breaks down the powerful superoxide anions generated by aerobic metabolism:

     The enzyme catalase converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen as shown in Reaction 3.

     Obligate anaerobes usually lack all three enzymes. Aerotolerant anaerobes do have SOD but no catalase. Reaction
     3, shown occurring in Figure 9.23, is the basis of a useful and rapid test to distinguish streptococci, which are
     aerotolerant and do not possess catalase, from staphylococci, which are facultative anaerobes. A sample of culture
     rapidly mixed in a drop of 3% hydrogen peroxide will release bubbles if the culture is catalase positive.

Bacteria that grow best in a higher concentration of CO2 and a lower concentration of oxygen than present in the
atmosphere are called capnophiles. One common approach to grow capnophiles is to use a candle jar. A candle jar
consists of a jar with a tight-fitting lid that can accommodate the cultures and a candle. After the cultures are added
to the jar, the candle is lit and the lid closed. As the candle burns, it consumes most of the oxygen present and

  The health-care provider who saw Jeni was concerned primarily because of her pregnancy. Her condition
  enhances the risk for infections and makes her more vulnerable to those infections. The immune system is
  downregulated during pregnancy, and pathogens that cross the placenta can be very dangerous for the fetus. A
  note on the provider's order to the microbiology lab mentions a suspicion of infection by Listeria

  Jeni's blood samples are streaked directly on sheep blood agar, a medium containing tryptic soy agar enriched
  with 5% sheep blood. (Blood is considered sterile; therefore, competing microorganisms are not expected in the
  medium.) The inoculated plates are incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 hours. Small grayish colonies surrounded by
  a clear zone emerge. Such colonies are typical of Listeria and other pathogens such as streptococci; the clear
  zone surrounding the colonies indicates complete lysis of blood in the medium, referred to as beta-hemolysis
  (Figure 9.24). When tested for the presence of catalase, the colonies give a positive response, eliminating
  Streptococcus as a possible cause. Furthermore, a Gram stain shows short gram-positive bacilli. Cells from a
  broth culture grown at room temperature displayed the tumbling motility characteristic of Listeria (Figure 9.24).
  All of these clues lead the lab to positively confirm the presence of Listeria in Jeni's blood samples.

     9.3 The Effects of pH on Microbial Growth

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Illustrate and briefly describe minimum, optimum, and maximum pH requirements for growth
         · Identify and describe the different categories of microbes with pH requirements for growth: acidophiles,

             neutrophiles, and alkaliphiles
         · Give examples of microorganisms for each category of pH requirement
     Yogurt, pickles, sauerkraut, and lime-seasoned dishes all owe their tangy taste to a high acid content (Figure 9.25).
     Recall that acidity is a function of the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] and is measured as pH. Environments with
     pH values below 7.0 are considered acidic, whereas those with pH values above 7.0 are considered basic. Extreme
     pH affects the structure of all macromolecules. The hydrogen bonds holding together strands of DNA break up at
     high pH. Lipids are hydrolyzed by an extremely basic pH. The proton motive force responsible for production of ATP
     in cellular respiration depends on the concentration gradient of H+ across the plasma membrane (see Cellular
     Respiration). If H+ ions are neutralized by hydroxide ions, the concentration gradient collapses and impairs energy
     production. But the component most sensitive to pH in the cell is its workhorse, the protein. Moderate changes in pH
     modify the ionization of amino-acid functional groups and disrupt hydrogen bonding, which, in turn, promotes
     changes in the folding of the molecule, promoting denaturation and destroying activity.

     FIGURE 9.25 Lactic acid bacteria that ferment milk into yogurt or transform vegetables in pickles thrive at a pH close to 4.0. Sauerkraut and
     dishes such as pico de gallo owe their tangy flavor to their acidity. Acidic foods have been a mainstay of the human diet for centuries, partly
     because most microbes that cause food spoilage grow best at a near neutral pH and do not tolerate acidity well. (credit "yogurt":

     The optimum growth pH is the most favorable pH for the growth of an organism. The lowest pH value that an
     organism can tolerate is called the minimum growth pH and the highest pH is the maximum growth pH. These
     values can cover a wide range, which is important for the preservation of food and to microorganisms' survival in the

stomach. For example, the optimum growth pH of Salmonella spp. is 7.0-7.5, but the minimum growth pH is closer
to 4.2.

Most bacteria are neutrophiles, meaning they grow optimally at a pH within one or two pH units of the neutral pH of
7 (see Figure 9.26). Most familiar bacteria, like Escherichia coli, staphylococci, and Salmonella spp. are neutrophiles
and do not fare well in the acidic pH of the stomach. However, there are pathogenic strains of E. coli, S. typhi, and
other species of intestinal pathogens that are much more resistant to stomach acid. In comparison, fungi thrive at
slightly acidic pH values of 5.0-6.0.

Microorganisms that grow optimally at pH less than 5.55 are called acidophiles. For example, the sulfur-oxidizing
Sulfolobus spp. isolated from sulfur mud fields and hot springs in Yellowstone National Park are extreme
acidophiles. These archaea survive at pH values of 2.5-3.5. Species of the archaean genus Ferroplasma live in acid
mine drainage at pH values of 0-2.9. Lactobacillus bacteria, which are an important part of the normal microbiota of
the vagina, can tolerate acidic environments at pH values 3.5-6.8 and also contribute to the acidity of the vagina
(pH of 4, except at the onset of menstruation) through their metabolic production of lactic acid. The vagina's acidity
plays an important role in inhibiting other microbes that are less tolerant of acidity. Acidophilic microorganisms
display a number of adaptations to survive in strong acidic environments. For example, proteins show increased
negative surface charge that stabilizes them at low pH. Pumps actively eject H+ ions out of the cells. The changes in
the composition of membrane phospholipids probably reflect the need to maintain membrane fluidity at low pH.

FIGURE 9.26 The curves show the approximate pH ranges for the growth of the different classes of pH-specific prokaryotes. Each curve
has an optimal pH and extreme pH values at which growth is much reduced. Most bacteria are neutrophiles and grow best at near-neutral
pH (center curve). Acidophiles have optimal growth at pH values near 3 and alkaliphiles have optimal growth at pH values above 9.

At the other end of the spectrum are alkaliphiles, microorganisms that grow best at pH between 8.0 and 10.5.
Vibrio cholerae, the pathogenic agent of cholera, grows best at the slightly basic pH of 8.0; it can survive pH values
of 11.0 but is inactivated by the acid of the stomach. When it comes to survival at high pH, the bright pink archaean
Natronobacterium, found in the soda lakes of the African Rift Valley, may hold the record at a pH of 10.5 (Figure
9.27). Extreme alkaliphiles have adapted to their harsh environment through evolutionary modification of lipid and
protein structure and compensatory mechanisms to maintain the proton motive force in an alkaline environment.
For example, the alkaliphile Bacillus firmus derives the energy for transport reactions and motility from a Na+ ion
gradient rather than a proton motive force. Many enzymes from alkaliphiles have a higher isoelectric point, due to an
increase in the number of basic amino acids, than homologous enzymes from neutrophiles.

     Survival at the Low pH of the Stomach

     Peptic ulcers (or stomach ulcers) are painful sores on the stomach lining. Until the 1980s, they were believed to be
     caused by spicy foods, stress, or a combination of both. Patients were typically advised to eat bland foods, take anti-
     acid medications, and avoid stress. These remedies were not particularly effective, and the condition often recurred.
     This all changed dramatically when the real cause of most peptic ulcers was discovered to be a slim, corkscrew-
     shaped bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. This organism was identified and isolated by Barry Marshall and Robin
     Warren, whose discovery earned them the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2005.

     The ability of H. pylori to survive the low pH of the stomach would seem to suggest that it is an extreme acidophile.
     As it turns out, this is not the case. In fact, H. pylori is a neutrophile. So, how does it survive in the stomach?
     Remarkably, H. pylori creates a microenvironment in which the pH is nearly neutral. It achieves this by producing
     large amounts of the enzyme urease, which breaks down urea to form NH4+ and CO2. The ammonium ion raises the
     pH of the immediate environment.

     This metabolic capability of H. pylori is the basis of an accurate, noninvasive test for infection. The patient is given a
     solution of urea containing radioactively labeled carbon atoms. If H. pylori is present in the stomach, it will rapidly
     break down the urea, producing radioactive CO2 that can be detected in the patient's breath. Because peptic ulcers
     may lead to gastric cancer, patients who are determined to have H. pylori infections are treated with antibiotics.

     When the exploration of Lake Whillans started in Antarctica, researchers did not expect to find much life. Constant

     thriving ecosystem. To their surprise, the samples retrieved from the lake showed abundant microbial life. In a

different but equally harsh setting, bacteria grow at the bottom of the ocean in sea vents (Figure 9.28), where
temperatures can reach 340 °C (700 °F).

Microbes can be roughly classified according to the range of temperature at which they can grow. The growth rates
are the highest at the optimum growth temperature for the organism. The lowest temperature at which the
organism can survive and replicate is its minimum growth temperature. The highest temperature at which growth
can occur is its maximum growth temperature. The following ranges of permissive growth temperatures are
approximate only and can vary according to other environmental factors.

Organisms categorized as mesophiles ("middle loving") are adapted to moderate temperatures, with optimal
growth temperatures ranging from room temperature (about 20 °C) to about 45 °C. As would be expected from the
core temperature of the human body, 37 °C (98.6 °F), normal human microbiota and pathogens (e.g., E. coli,
Salmonella spp., and Lactobacillus spp.) are mesophiles.

Organisms called psychrotrophs, also known as psychrotolerant, prefer cooler environments, from a high
temperature of 25 °C to refrigeration temperature about 4 °C. They are found in many natural environments in
temperate climates. They are also responsible for the spoilage of refrigerated food.

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Resolution

  The presence of Listeria in Jeni's blood suggests that her symptoms are due to listeriosis, an infection caused by
  L. monocytogenes. Listeriosis is a serious infection with a 20% mortality rate and is a particular risk to Jeni's
  fetus. A sample from the amniotic fluid cultured for the presence of Listeria gave negative results. Because the
  absence of organisms does not rule out the possibility of infection, a molecular test based on the nucleic acid
  amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA of Listeria was performed to confirm that no bacteria crossed the
  placenta. Fortunately, the results from the molecular test were also negative.

  Jeni was admitted to the hospital for treatment and recovery. She received a high dose of two antibiotics
  intravenously for 2 weeks. The preferred drugs for the treatment of listeriosis are ampicillin or penicillin G with
  an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Resistance to common antibiotics is still rare in Listeria and antibiotic treatment is
  usually successful. She was released to home care after a week and fully recovered from her infection.

  L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive short rod found in soil, water, and food. It is classified as a psychrophile
  and is halotolerant. Its ability to multiply at refrigeration temperatures (4-10 °C) and its tolerance for high
  concentrations of salt (up to 10% sodium chloride [NaCl]) make it a frequent source of food poisoning. Because
  Listeria can infect animals, it often contaminates food such as meat, fish, or dairy products. Contamination of
  commercial foods can often be traced to persistent biofilms that form on manufacturing equipment that is not
  sufficiently cleaned.

  Listeria infection is relatively common among pregnant people because the elevated levels of progesterone
  downregulate the immune system, making them more vulnerable to infection. The pathogen can cross the
  placenta and infect the fetus, often resulting in miscarriage, stillbirth, or fatal neonatal infection. Pregnant
  people are thus advised to avoid consumption of soft cheeses, refrigerated cold cuts, smoked seafood, and
  unpasteurized dairy products. Because Listeria bacteria can easily be confused with diphtheroids, another
  common group of gram-positive rods, it is important to alert the laboratory when listeriosis is suspected.

  Go back to the previous Clinical Focus box.

The organisms retrieved from arctic lakes such as Lake Whillans are considered extreme psychrophiles (cold
loving). Psychrophiles are microorganisms that can grow at 0 °C and below, have an optimum growth temperature
close to
15 °C, and usually do not survive at temperatures above 20 °C. They are found in permanently cold environments
such as the deep waters of the oceans. Because they are active at low temperature, psychrophiles and
psychrotrophs are important decomposers in cold climates.

Organisms that grow at optimum temperatures of 50 °C to a maximum of 80 °C are called thermophiles ("heat
348  9 · Microbial Growth

     loving"). They do not multiply at room temperature. Thermophiles are widely distributed in hot springs, geothermal
     soils, and manmade environments such as garden compost piles where the microbes break down kitchen scraps
     and vegetal material. Examples of thermophiles include Thermus aquaticus and Geobacillus spp. Higher up on the
     extreme temperature scale we find the hyperthermophiles, which are characterized by growth ranges from 80 °C to
     a maximum of 110 °C, with some extreme examples that survive temperatures above 121 °C, the average
     temperature of an autoclave. The hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean are a prime example of extreme
     environments, with temperatures reaching an estimated 340 °C (Figure 9.28). Microbes isolated from the vents
     achieve optimal growth at temperatures higher than 100 °C. Noteworthy examples are Pyrobolus and Pyrodictium,
     archaea that grow at 105 °C and survive autoclaving. Figure 9.29 shows the typical skewed curves of temperature-
     dependent growth for the categories of microorganisms we have discussed.

     FIGURE 9.28 A black smoker at the bottom of the ocean belches hot, chemical-rich water, and heats the surrounding waters. Sea vents
     provide an extreme environment that is nonetheless teeming with macroscopic life (the red tubeworms) supported by an abundant
     microbial ecosystem. (credit: NOAA)

     FIGURE 9.29 The graph shows growth rate of bacteria as a function of temperature. Notice that the curves are skewed toward the optimum
     temperature. The skewing of the growth curve is thought to reflect the rapid denaturation of proteins as the temperature rises past the
     optimum for growth of the microorganism.

     Life in extreme environments raises fascinating questions about the adaptation of macromolecules and metabolic
     processes. Very low temperatures affect cells in many ways. Membranes lose their fluidity and are damaged by ice
     crystal formation. Chemical reactions and diffusion slow considerably. Proteins become too rigid to catalyze
     reactions and may undergo denaturation. At the opposite end of the temperature spectrum, heat denatures proteins
     and nucleic acids. Increased fluidity impairs metabolic processes in membranes. Some of the practical applications
     of the destructive effects of heat on microbes are sterilization by steam, pasteurization, and incineration of
     inoculating loops. Proteins in psychrophiles are, in general, rich in hydrophobic residues, display an increase in
     flexibility, and have a lower number of secondary stabilizing bonds when compared with homologous proteins from

mesophiles. Antifreeze proteins and solutes that decrease the freezing temperature of the cytoplasm are common.
The lipids in the membranes tend to be unsaturated to increase fluidity. Growth rates are much slower than those
encountered at moderate temperatures. Under appropriate conditions, mesophiles and even thermophiles can
survive freezing. Liquid cultures of bacteria are mixed with sterile glycerol solutions and frozen to -80 °C for long-
term storage as stocks. Cultures can withstand freeze drying (lyophilization) and then be stored as powders in
sealed ampules to be reconstituted with broth when needed.

Macromolecules in thermophiles and hyperthermophiles show some notable structural differences from what is
observed in the mesophiles. The ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated lipids increases to limit the fluidity of the cell
membranes. Their DNA sequences show a higher proportion of guanine-cytosine nitrogenous bases, which are held
together by three hydrogen bonds in contrast to adenine and thymine, which are connected in the double helix by
two hydrogen bonds. Additional secondary structures, ionic and covalent bonds, as well as the replacement of key
amino acids to stabilize folding, contribute to the resistance of proteins to denaturation. The so-called
thermoenzymes purified from thermophiles have important practical applications. For example, amplification of
nucleic acids in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) depends on the thermal stability of Taq polymerase, an enzyme
isolated from T. aquaticus. Degradation enzymes from thermophiles are added as ingredients in hot-water
detergents, increasing their effectiveness.

EYE ON ETHICS

Feeding the World...and the World's Algae

Artificial fertilizers have become an important tool in food production around the world. They are responsible for
many of the gains of the so-called green revolution of the 20th century, which has allowed the planet to feed
many of its more than 7 billion people. Artificial fertilizers provide nitrogen and phosphorus, key limiting
nutrients, to crop plants, removing the normal barriers that would otherwise limit the rate of growth. Thus,
fertilized crops grow much faster, and farms that use fertilizer produce higher crop yields.

However, careless use and overuse of artificial fertilizers have been demonstrated to have significant negative
impacts on aquatic ecosystems, both freshwater and marine. Fertilizers that are applied at inappropriate times
or in too-large quantities allow nitrogen and phosphorus compounds to escape use by crop plants and enter
drainage systems. Inappropriate use of fertilizers in residential settings can also contribute to nutrient loads,
which find their way to lakes and coastal marine ecosystems. As water warms and nutrients are plentiful,
microscopic algae bloom, often changing the color of the water because of the high cell density.

Most algal blooms are not directly harmful to humans or wildlife; however, they can cause harm indirectly. As the
algal population expands and then dies, it provides a large increase in organic matter to the bacteria that live in
deep water. With this large supply of nutrients, the population of nonphotosynthetic microorganisms explodes,
consuming available oxygen and creating "dead zones" where animal life has virtually disappeared.

Depletion of oxygen in the water is not the only damaging consequence of some algal blooms. The algae that
produce red tides in the Gulf of Mexico, Karenia brevis, secrete potent toxins that can kill fish and other
organisms and also accumulate in shellfish. Consumption of contaminated shellfish can cause severe
neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. Shellfish beds must be regularly monitored for the
presence of the toxins, and harvests are often shut down when it is present, incurring economic costs to the
fishery. Cyanobacteria, which can form blooms in marine and freshwater ecosystems, produce toxins called
microcystins, which can cause allergic reactions and liver damage when ingested in drinking water or during
swimming. Recurring cyanobacterial algal blooms in Lake Erie (Figure 9.30) have forced municipalities to issue
drinking water bans for days at a time because of unacceptable toxin levels.
350  9 · Microbial Growth

     This is just a small sampling of the negative consequences of algal blooms, red tides, and dead zones. Yet the
     benefits of crop fertilizer--the main cause of such blooms--are difficult to dispute. There is no easy solution to
     this dilemma, as a ban on fertilizers is not politically or economically feasible. In lieu of this, we must advocate
     for responsible use and regulation in agricultural and residential contexts, as well as the restoration of wetlands,
     which can absorb excess fertilizers before they reach lakes and oceans.

        FIGURE 9.30 Heavy rains cause runoff of fertilizers into Lake Erie, triggering extensive algal blooms, which can be observed along the
        shoreline. Notice the brown unplanted and green planted agricultural land on the shore. (credit: NASA)

     9.5 Other Environmental Conditions that Affect Growth

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify and describe different categories of microbes with specific growth requirements other than
             oxygen, pH, and temperature, such as altered barometric pressure, osmotic pressure, humidity, and light

         · Give at least one example microorganism for each category of growth requirement
     Microorganisms interact with their environment along more dimensions than pH, temperature, and free oxygen
     levels, although these factors require significant adaptations. We also find microorganisms adapted to varying levels
     of salinity, barometric pressure, humidity, and light.

     Osmotic and Barometric Pressure

     Most natural environments tend to have lower solute concentrations than the cytoplasm of most microorganisms.
     Rigid cell walls protect the cells from bursting in a dilute environment. Not much protection is available against high
     osmotic pressure. In this case, water, following its concentration gradient, flows out of the cell. This results in
     plasmolysis (the shrinking of the protoplasm away from the intact cell wall) and cell death. This fact explains why
     brines and layering meat and fish in salt are time-honored methods of preserving food. Microorganisms called
     halophiles ("salt loving") actually require high salt concentrations for growth. These organisms are found in marine
     environments where salt concentrations hover at 3.5%. Extreme halophilic microorganisms, such as the red alga
     Dunaliella salina and the archaeal species Halobacterium in Figure 9.31, grow in hypersaline lakes such as the Great
     Salt Lake, which is 3.5-8 times saltier than the ocean, and the Dead Sea, which is 10 times saltier than the ocean.

FIGURE 9.31 Photograph taken from space of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The purple color is caused by high density of the alga Dunaliella
and the archaean Halobacterium spp. (credit: NASA)

Dunaliella spp. counters the tremendous osmotic pressure of the environment with a high cytoplasmic
concentration of glycerol and by actively pumping out salt ions. Halobacterium spp. accumulates large
concentrations of K+ and other ions in its cytoplasm. Its proteins are designed for high salt concentrations and lose
activity at salt concentrations below 1-2 M. Although most halotolerant organisms, for example Halomonas spp. in
salt marshes, do not need high concentrations of salt for growth, they will survive and divide in the presence of high
salt. Not surprisingly, the staphylococci, micrococci, and corynebacteria that colonize our skin tolerate salt in their
environment. Halotolerant pathogens are an important cause of food-borne illnesses because they survive and
multiply in salty food. For example, the halotolerant bacteria S. aureus, Bacillus cereus, and V. cholerae produce
dangerous enterotoxins and are major causes of food poisoning.

Microorganisms depend on available water to grow. Available moisture is measured as water activity (aw), which is
the ratio of the vapor pressure of the medium of interest to the vapor pressure of pure distilled water; therefore, the
aw of water is equal to 1.0. Bacteria require high aw (0.97-0.99), whereas fungi can tolerate drier environments; for
example, the range of aw for growth of Aspergillus spp. is 0.8-0.75. Decreasing the water content of foods by drying,
as in jerky, or through freeze-drying or by increasing osmotic pressure, as in brine and jams, are common methods of
preventing spoilage.

Microorganisms that require high atmospheric pressure for growth are called barophiles. The bacteria that live at
the bottom of the ocean must be able to withstand great pressures. Because it is difficult to retrieve intact
specimens and reproduce such growth conditions in the laboratory, the characteristics of these microorganisms are
largely unknown.

Light

Photoautotrophs, such as cyanobacteria or green sulfur bacteria, and photoheterotrophs, such as purple nonsulfur
bacteria, depend on sufficient light intensity at the wavelengths absorbed by their pigments to grow and multiply.
Energy from light is captured by pigments and converted into chemical energy that drives carbon fixation and other
metabolic processes. The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is absorbed by these organisms is defined
as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). It lies within the visible light spectrum ranging from 400 to 700
nanometers (nm) and extends in the near infrared for some photosynthetic bacteria. A number of accessory
pigments, such as fucoxanthin in brown algae and phycobilins in cyanobacteria, widen the useful range of
wavelengths for photosynthesis and compensate for the low light levels available at greater depths of water. Other
microorganisms, such as the archaea of the class Halobacteria, use light energy to drive their proton and sodium
pumps. The light is absorbed by a pigment protein complex called bacteriorhodopsin, which is similar to the eye
pigment rhodopsin. Photosynthetic bacteria are present not only in aquatic environments but also in soil and in
symbiosis with fungi in lichens. The peculiar watermelon snow is caused by a microalga Chlamydomonas nivalis, a

     9.6 Media Used for Bacterial Growth

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify and describe culture media for the growth of bacteria, including examples of all-purpose media,
             enriched, selective, differential, defined, and enrichment media

     The study of microorganisms is greatly facilitated if we are able to culture them, that is, to keep reproducing
     populations alive under laboratory conditions. Culturing many microorganisms is challenging because of highly
     specific nutritional and environmental requirements and the diversity of these requirements among different
     species.

     Nutritional Requirements

     The number of available media to grow bacteria is considerable. Some media are considered general all-purpose
     media and support growth of a large variety of organisms. A prime example of an all-purpose medium is tryptic soy
     broth (TSB). Specialized media are used in the identification of bacteria and are supplemented with dyes, pH
     indicators, or antibiotics. One type, enriched media, contains growth factors, vitamins, and other essential nutrients
     to promote the growth of fastidious organisms, organisms that cannot make certain nutrients and require them to
     be added to the medium. When the complete chemical composition of a medium is known, it is called a chemically
     defined medium. For example, in EZ medium, all individual chemical components are identified and the exact
     amounts of each is known. In complex media, which contain extracts and digests of yeasts, meat, or plants, the
     precise chemical composition of the medium is not known. Amounts of individual components are undetermined
     and variable. Nutrient broth, tryptic soy broth, and brain heart infusion, are all examples of complex media.

     Non-selective media support the growth of all microorganisms without any specific inhibition. They may be used to
     cultivate organisms for other uses, as well as in specific procedures. The Mueller-Hinton agar, developed by John
     Mueller and Jane Hinton, is a non-selective media often used to test antibiotics and such as in the Kirby-Bauer disc
     diffusion test (described in the chapter on Antimicrobial Drugs). In addition to beef extract and agar, it contains
     starch, which supports growth and also absorbs toxins, which ensures that the antibiotics continue to function.
     Mueller-Hinton agar is also known as a loose agar, which allows chemicals to diffuse more effectively than similar
     substances.

     Media that inhibit the growth of unwanted microorganisms and support the growth of the organism of interest by
     supplying nutrients and reducing competition are called selective media. An example of a selective medium is
     MacConkey agar. It contains bile salts and crystal violet, which interfere with the growth of many gram-positive
     bacteria and favor the growth of gram-negative bacteria, particularly the Enterobacteriaceae. These species are
     commonly named enterics, reside in the intestine, and are adapted to the presence of bile salts. The enrichment
     cultures foster the preferential growth of a desired microorganism that represents a fraction of the organisms
     present in an inoculum. For example, if we want to isolate bacteria that break down crude oil, hydrocarbonoclastic
     bacteria, sequential subculturing in a medium that supplies carbon only in the form of crude oil will enrich the
     cultures with oil-eating bacteria. The differential media make it easy to distinguish colonies of different bacteria by
     a change in the color of the colonies or the color of the medium. Color changes are the result of end products
     created by interaction of bacterial enzymes with differential substrates in the medium or, in the case of hemolytic
     reactions, the lysis of red blood cells in the medium. In Figure 9.32, the differential fermentation of lactose can be
     observed on MacConkey agar. The lactose fermenters produce acid, which turns the medium and the colonies of
     strong fermenters hot pink. The medium is supplemented with the pH indicator neutral red, which turns to hot pink
     at low pH. Selective and differential media can be combined and play an important role in the identification of

  CASE IN POINT

  The End-of-Year Picnic

  The microbiology department is celebrating the end of the school year in May by holding its traditional picnic on
  the green. The speeches drag on for a couple of hours, but finally all the faculty and students can dig into the
  food: chicken salad, tomatoes, onions, salad, and custard pie. By evening, the whole department, except for two
  vegetarian students who did not eat the chicken salad, is stricken with nausea, vomiting, retching, and
  abdominal cramping. Several individuals complain of diarrhea. One patient shows signs of shock (low blood
  pressure). Blood and stool samples are collected from patients, and an analysis of all foods served at the meal is
  conducted.

  Bacteria can cause gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestinal tract) either by colonizing and
  replicating in the host, which is considered an infection, or by secreting toxins, which is considered intoxication.
  Signs and symptoms of infections are typically delayed, whereas intoxication manifests within hours, as
  happened after the picnic.

  Blood samples from the patients showed no signs of bacterial infection, which further suggests that this was a
  case of intoxication. Since intoxication is due to secreted toxins, bacteria are not usually detected in blood or
  stool samples. MacConkey agar and sorbitol-MacConkey agar plates and xylose-lysine-deoxycholate (XLD)
  plates were inoculated with stool samples and did not reveal any unusually colored colonies, and no black
  colonies or white colonies were observed on XLD. All lactose fermenters on MacConkey agar also ferment
  sorbitol. These results ruled out common agents of food-borne illnesses: E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Shigella
  spp.

  Analysis of the chicken salad revealed an abnormal number of gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters (Figure
354  9 · Microbial Growth

     9.33). A culture of the gram-positive cocci releases bubbles when mixed with hydrogen peroxide. The culture
     turned mannitol salt agar yellow after a 24-hour incubation.

     All the tests point to Staphylococcus aureus as the organism that secreted the toxin. Samples from the salad
     showed the presence of gram-positive cocci bacteria in clusters. The colonies were positive for catalase. The
     bacteria grew on mannitol salt agar fermenting mannitol, as shown by the change to yellow of the medium. The
     pH indicator in mannitol salt agar is phenol red, which turns to yellow when the medium is acidified by the
     products of fermentation.

     The toxin secreted by S. aureus is known to cause severe gastroenteritis. The organism was probably introduced
     into the salad during preparation by the food handler and multiplied while the salad was kept in the warm
     ambient temperature during the speeches.

         · What are some other factors that might have contributed to rapid growth of S. aureus in the chicken salad?
         · Why would S. aureus not be inhibited by the presence of salt in the chicken salad?

other, but not exactly the same--except in the case of identical twins. How can we explain these phenomena? The
answers lie in heredity (the transmission of traits from one generation to the next) and genetics (the science of
heredity). Because humans reproduce sexually, 50% of a child's genes come from the egg cell and the remaining
50% from the sperm cell. Sperm and egg are formed through the process of meiosis, where DNA recombination
occurs. Thus, there is no predictable pattern as to which 50% comes from which parent. Thus, siblings have only
some genes, and their associated characteristics, in common. Identical twins are the exception, because they are
genetically identical.
Genetic differences among related microbes also dictate many observed biochemical and virulence differences. For
example, some strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli are harmless members of the normal microbiota in the
362  10 · Biochemistry of the Genome

     human gastrointestinal tract. Other strains of the same species have genes that give them the ability to cause
     disease. In bacteria, such genes are not inherited via sexual reproduction, as in humans. Often, they are transferred
     via plasmids, small circular pieces of double-stranded DNA that can be exchanged between prokaryotes.

     Through the early 20th century, DNA was not yet recognized as the genetic material responsible for heredity, the
     passage of traits from one generation to the next. In fact, much of the research was dismissed until the mid-20th
     century. The scientific community believed, incorrectly, that the process of inheritance involved a blending of
     parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this hypothetical process appeared
     to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation, which results from the action of many genes to
     determine a particular characteristic, like human height. Offspring appear to be a "blend" of their parents' traits
     when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. The blending theory of inheritance asserted that
     the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not
     the case.

     Two separate lines of research, begun in the mid to late 1800s, ultimately led to the discovery and characterization
     of DNA and the foundations of genetics, the science of heredity. These lines of research began to converge in the
     1920s, and research using microbial systems ultimately resulted in significant contributions to elucidating the
     molecular basis of genetics.

     Discovery and Characterization of DNA

     Modern understanding of DNA has evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix
     model. In the 1860s, Friedrich Miescher (1844-1895), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate
     phosphorus-rich chemicals from leukocytes (white blood cells) from the pus on used bandages from a local surgical
     clinic. He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and DNA) "nuclein" because they were
     isolated from the nuclei of the cells. His student Richard Altmann (1852-1900) subsequently termed it "nucleic
     acid" 20 years later when he discovered the acidic nature of nuclein. In the last two decades of the 19th century,
     German biochemist Albrecht Kossel (1853-1927) isolated and characterized the five different nucleotide bases
     composing nucleic acid. These are adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine (in DNA), and uracil (in RNA). Kossell
     received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his work on nucleic acids and for his considerable
     work on proteins, including the discovery of histidine.

     Foundations of Genetics

     Despite the discovery of DNA in the late 1800s, scientists did not make the association with heredity for many more
     decades. To make this connection, scientists, including a number of microbiologists, performed many experiments
     on plants, animals, and bacteria.

Mendel's Pea Plants
While Miescher was isolating and discovering DNA in the 1860s, Austrian monk and botanist Johann Gregor Mendel
(1822-1884) was experimenting with garden peas, demonstrating and documenting basic patterns of inheritance,
now known as Mendel's laws.

In 1856, Mendel began his decade-long research into inheritance patterns. He used the diploid garden pea, Pisum
sativum, as his primary model system because it naturally self-fertilizes and is highly inbred, producing "true-
breeding" pea plant lines--plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with
true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if he
used plants that were not true-breeding. Mendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding
individuals (P generation) that have different traits, and examined the characteristics of their offspring (first filial
generation, F1) as well as the offspring of self-fertilization of the F1 generation (second filial generation, F2) (Figure
10.2).

FIGURE 10.2 In one of his experiments on inheritance patterns, Mendel crossed plants that were true- breeding for violet flower color with
plants true-breeding for white flower color (the P generation). The resulting hybrids in the F1 generation all had violet flowers. In the F2
generation, approximately three-quarters of the plants had violet flowers, and one-quarter had white flowers.

In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local natural history
society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring independently of other
traits. In 1866, he published his work, "Experiments in Plant Hybridization,"1 in the Proceedings of the Natural
History Society of Brunn. Mendel's work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which believed,
incorrectly, in the theory of blending of traits in continuous variation.

He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900
that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the
chromosomal basis of heredity.

The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
Mendel carried out his experiments long before chromosomes were visualized under a microscope. However, with
the improvement of microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell biologists could stain and visualize
subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during meiosis. They were able to observe chromosomes
replicating, condensing from an amorphous nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies and migrating to separate
cellular poles. The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists
to examine Mendel's publications and re-evaluate his model in terms of the behavior of chromosomes during
mitosis and meiosis.

In 1902, Theodor Boveri (1862-1915) observed that in sea urchins, nuclear components (chromosomes)
determined proper embryonic development. That same year, Walter Sutton (1877-1916) observed the separation
of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis. Together, these observations led to the development of the
Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for
Mendelian inheritance.

364  10 · Biochemistry of the Genome

     Despite compelling correlations between the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and Mendel's observations,
     the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was proposed long before there was any direct evidence that traits were
     carried on chromosomes. Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945) and his colleagues spent several years carrying out
     crosses with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. They performed meticulous microscopic observations of fly
     chromosomes and correlated these observations with resulting fly characteristics. Their work provided the first
     experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance in the early 1900s. In 1915, Morgan and
     his "Fly Room" colleagues published The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity, which identified chromosomes as the
     cellular structures responsible for heredity. For his many significant contributions to genetics, Morgan received the
     Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933.

     In the late 1920s, Barbara McClintock (1902-1992) developed chromosomal staining techniques to visualize and
     differentiate between the different chromosomes of maize (corn). In the 1940s and 1950s, she identified a
     breakage event on chromosome 9, which she named the dissociation locus (Ds). Ds could change position within the
     chromosome. She also identified an activator locus (Ac). Ds chromosome breakage could be activated by an Ac
     element (transposase enzyme). At first, McClintock's finding of these jumping genes, which we now call
     transposons, was not accepted by the scientific community. It wasn't until the 1960s and later that transposons
     were discovered in bacteriophages, bacteria, and Drosophila. Today, we know that transposons are mobile
     segments of DNA that can move within the genome of an organism. They can regulate gene expression, protein
     expression, and virulence (ability to cause disease).

     Microbes and Viruses in Genetic Research
     Microbiologists have also played a crucial part in our understanding of genetics. Experimental organisms such as
     Mendel's garden peas, Morgan's fruit flies, and McClintock's corn had already been used successfully to pave the
     way for an understanding of genetics. However, microbes and viruses were (and still are) excellent model systems
     for the study of genetics because, unlike peas, fruit flies, and corn, they are propagated more easily in the
     laboratory, growing to high population densities in a small amount of space and in a short time. In addition, because
     of their structural simplicity, microbes and viruses are more readily manipulated genetically.

     Fortunately, despite significant differences in size, structure, reproduction strategies, and other biological
     characteristics, there is biochemical unity among all organisms; they have in common the same underlying
     molecules responsible for heredity and the use of genetic material to give cells their varying characteristics. In the
     words of French scientist Jacques Monod, "What is true for E. coli is also true for the elephant," meaning that the
     biochemistry of life has been maintained throughout evolution and is shared in all forms of life, from simple
     unicellular organisms to large, complex organisms. This biochemical continuity makes microbes excellent models to
     use for genetic studies.

     In a clever set of experiments in the 1930s and 1940s, German scientist Joachim Hämmerling (1901-1980), using
     the single-celled alga Acetabularia as a microbial model, established that the genetic information in a eukaryotic
     cell is housed within the nucleus. Acetabularia spp. are unusually large algal cells that grow asymmetrically, forming
     a "foot" containing the nucleus, which is used for substrate attachment; a stalk; and an umbrella-like
     cap--structures that can all be easily seen with the naked eye. In an early set of experiments, Hämmerling removed
     either the cap or the foot of the cells and observed whether new caps or feet were regenerated (Figure 10.3). He
     found that when the foot of these cells was removed, new feet did not grow; however, when caps were removed
     from the cells, new caps were regenerated. This suggested that the hereditary information was located in the
     nucleus-containing foot of each cell.

FIGURE 10.3 (a) The cells of the single-celled alga Acetabularia measure 2-6 cm and have a cell morphology that can be observed with the
naked eye. Each cell has a cap, a stalk, and a foot, which contains the nucleus. (b) Hämmerling found that if he removed the cap, a new cap
would regenerate; but if he removed the foot, a new foot would not regenerate. He concluded that the genetic information needed for
regeneration was found in the nucleus. (credit a: modification of work by James St. John)

In another set of experiments, Hämmerling used two species of Acetabularia that have different cap morphologies,
A. crenulata and A. mediterranea (Figure 10.4). He cut the caps from both types of cells and then grafted the stalk
from an A. crenulata onto an A. mediterranea foot, and vice versa. Over time, he observed that the grafted cell with
the A. crenulata foot and A. mediterranea stalk developed a cap with the A. crenulata morphology. Conversely, the
grafted cell with the A. mediterranea foot and A. crenulata stalk developed a cap with the A. mediterranea
morphology. He microscopically confirmed the presence of nuclei in the feet of these cells and attributed the
development of these cap morphologies to the nucleus of each grafted cell. Thus, he showed experimentally that
the nucleus was the location of genetic material that dictated a cell's properties.
366  10 · Biochemistry of the Genome

     FIGURE 10.4 In a second set of experiments, Hämmerling used two morphologically different species and grafted stalks from each species
     to the feet of the other. He found that the properties of the regenerated caps were dictated by the species of the nucleus-containing foot.

     Another microbial model, the red bread mold Neurospora crassa, was used by George Beadle and Edward Tatum to
     demonstrate the relationship between genes and the proteins they encode. Beadle had worked with fruit flies in
     Morgan's laboratory but found them too complex to perform certain types of experiments. N. crassa, on the other
     hand, is a simpler organism and has the ability to grow on a minimal medium because it contains enzymatic
     pathways that allow it to use the medium to produce its own vitamins and amino acids.
     Beadle and Tatum irradiated the mold with X-rays to induce changes to a sequence of nucleic acids, called
     mutations. They mated the irradiated mold spores and attempted to grow them on both a complete medium and a
     minimal medium. They looked for mutants that grew on a complete medium, supplemented with vitamins and
     amino acids, but did not grow on the minimal medium lacking these supplements. Such molds theoretically
     contained mutations in the genes that encoded biosynthetic pathways. Upon finding such mutants, they
     systematically tested each to determine which vitamin or amino acid it was unable to produce (Figure 10.5) and
     published this work in 1941.2

FIGURE 10.5 Beadle and Tatum's experiment involved the mating of irradiated and nonirradiated mold spores. These spores were grown
on both complete medium and a minimal medium to determine which amino acid or vitamin the mutant was unable to produce on its own.

Subsequent work by Beadle, Tatum, and colleagues showed that they could isolate different classes of mutants that
required a particular supplement, like the amino acid arginine (Figure 10.6). With some knowledge of the arginine
biosynthesis pathway, they identified three classes of arginine mutants by supplementing the minimal medium with
intermediates (citrulline or ornithine) in the pathway. The three mutants differed in their abilities to grow in each of
the media, which led the group of scientists to propose, in 1945, that each type of mutant had a defect in a different
gene in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. This led to the so-called one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, which
suggested that each gene encodes one enzyme.

Subsequent knowledge about the processes of transcription and translation led scientists to revise this to the "one
gene-one polypeptide" hypothesis. Although there are some genes that do not encode polypeptides (but rather
encode for transfer RNAs [tRNAs] or ribosomal RNAs [rRNAs], which we will discuss later), the one gene-one
enzyme hypothesis is true in many cases, especially in microbes. Beadle and Tatum's discovery of the link between
genes and corresponding characteristics earned them the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine and has
since become the basis for modern molecular genetics.

     FIGURE 10.6 Three classes of arginine mutants were identified, each differing in their ability to grow in the presence of intermediates in the
     arginine biosynthesis pathway. From this, Beadle and Tatum concluded that each mutant was defective in a different gene encoding a
     different enzyme in the arginine biosynthesis pathway, leading to them to their one gene-one enzyme hypothesis.

     DNA as the Molecule Responsible for Heredity

     By the beginning of the 20th century, a great deal of work had already been done on characterizing DNA and
     establishing the foundations of genetics, including attributing heredity to chromosomes found within the nucleus.
     Despite all of this research, it was not until well into the 20th century that these lines of research converged and
     scientists began to consider that DNA could be the genetic material that offspring inherited from their parents. DNA,
     containing only four different nucleotides, was thought to be structurally too simple to encode such complex genetic
     information. Instead, protein was thought to have the complexity required to serve as cellular genetic information
     because it is composed of 20 different amino acids that could be combined in a huge variety of combinations.
     Microbiologists played a pivotal role in the research that determined that DNA is the molecule responsible for

heredity.

Griffith's Transformation Experiments
British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith (1879-1941) was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary
information could be transferred from one cell to another "horizontally" (between members of the same
generation), rather than "vertically" (from parent to offspring). In 1928, he reported the first demonstration of
bacterial transformation, a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing its
characteristics.3 He was working with two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes
pneumonia: a rough (R) strain and a smooth (S) strain. The R strain is nonpathogenic and lacks a capsule on its outer
surface; as a result, colonies from the R strain appear rough when grown on plates. The S strain is pathogenic and
has a capsule outside its cell wall, allowing it to escape phagocytosis by the host immune system. The capsules
cause colonies from the S strain to appear smooth when grown on plates.

In a series of experiments, Griffith analyzed the effects of live R, live S, and heat-killed S strains of S. pneumoniae on
live mice (Figure 10.7). When mice were injected with the live S strain, the mice died. When he injected the mice
with the live R strain or the heat-killed S strain, the mice survived. But when he injected the mice with a mixture of
live R strain and heat-killed S strain, the mice died. Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, he only
recovered the S strain of bacteria. When he then injected this isolated S strain into fresh mice, the mice died. Griffith
concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and "transformed" it into
the pathogenic S strain; he called this the "transforming principle." These experiments are now famously known as
Griffith's transformation experiments.

FIGURE 10.7 In his famous series of experiments, Griffith used two strains of S. pneumoniae. The S strain is pathogenic and causes death.
Mice injected with the nonpathogenic R strain or the heat-killed S strain survive. However, a combination of the heat-killed S strain and the
live R strain causes the mice to die. The S strain recovered from the dead mouse showed that something had passed from the heat-killed S
strain to the R strain, transforming the R strain into an S strain in the process.

In 1944, Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty were interested in exploring Griffith's transforming
principle further. They isolated the S strain from infected dead mice, heat-killed it, and inactivated various
components of the S extract, conducting a systematic elimination study (Figure 10.8). They used enzymes that
specifically degraded proteins, RNA, and DNA and mixed the S extract with each of these individual enzymes. Then,

3 F. Griffith. "The Significance of Pneumococcal Types." Journal of Hygiene 27 no. 2 (1928):8-159.
370  10 · Biochemistry of the Genome

     they tested each extract/enzyme combination's resulting ability to transform the R strain, as observed by the diffuse
     growth of the S strain in culture media and confirmed visually by growth on plates. They found that when DNA was
     degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the R strain bacteria, whereas no other enzymatic
     treatment was able to prevent transformation. This led them to conclude that DNA was the transforming principle.
     Despite their results, many scientists did not accept their conclusion, instead believing that there were protein
     contaminants within their extracts.

Hershey and Chase's Proof of DNA as Genetic Material
Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase performed their own experiments in 1952 and were able to provide confirmatory
evidence that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material (Figure 10.9).4 Hershey and Chase were studying a
bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the
capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material, either DNA or RNA (see Viruses). The particular
bacteriophage they were studying was the T2 bacteriophage, which infects E. coli cells. As we now know today, T2
attaches to the surface of the bacterial cell and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. The phage DNA makes
multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of
bacteriophages.

Hershey and Chase labeled the protein coat in one batch of phage using radioactive sulfur, 35S, because sulfur is
found in the amino acids methionine and cysteine but not in nucleic acids. They labeled the DNA in another batch
using radioactive phosphorus, 32P, because phosphorus is found in DNA and RNA but not typically in protein.

Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After infection, Hershey and Chase put each phage
bacterial suspension in a blender, which detached the phage coats from the host cell, and spun down the resulting
suspension in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage
particles stayed in the supernatant. In the tube with the protein labeled, the radioactivity remained only in the
supernatant. In the tube with the DNA labeled, the radioactivity was detected only in the bacterial cells. Hershey
and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that was injected into the cell that carried the information to
produce more phage particles, thus proving that DNA, not proteins, was the source of the genetic material. As a
result of their work, the scientific community more broadly accepted DNA as the molecule responsible for heredity.

FIGURE 10.9 Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey conducted an experiment separately labeling the DNA and proteins of the T2 bacteriophage
to determine which component was the genetic material responsible for the production of new phage particles.

     By the time Hershey and Chase published their experiment in the early 1950s, microbiologists and other scientists
     had been researching heredity for over 80 years. Building on one another's research during that time culminated in
     the general agreement that DNA was the genetic material responsible for heredity (Figure 10.10). This knowledge
     set the stage for the age of molecular biology to come and the significant advancements in biotechnology and
     systems biology that we are experiencing today.

proteins, which, in turn, gives rise to products with diverse structure and function. In this section, we will discuss the
basic structure and function of DNA.

DNA Nucleotides

The building blocks of nucleic acids are nucleotides. Nucleotides that compose DNA are called
deoxyribonucleotides. The three components of a deoxyribonucleotide are a five-carbon sugar called deoxyribose,
a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base, a nitrogen-containing ring structure that is responsible for
complementary base pairing between nucleic acid strands (Figure 10.11). The carbon atoms of the five-carbon
deoxyribose are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (1 is read as "one prime"). A nucleoside comprises the five-carbon
sugar and nitrogenous base.

FIGURE 10.11 (a) Each deoxyribonucleotide is made up of a sugar called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base--in this
case, adenine. (b) The five carbons within deoxyribose are designated as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

The deoxyribonucleotide is named according to the nitrogenous bases (Figure 10.12). The nitrogenous bases
adenine (A) and guanine (G) are the purines; they have a double-ring structure with a six-carbon ring fused to a
five-carbon ring. The pyrimidines, cytosine (C) and thymine (T), are smaller nitrogenous bases that have only a six-
carbon ring structure.

FIGURE 10.12 Nitrogenous bases within DNA are categorized into the two-ringed purines adenine and guanine and the single-ringed
pyrimidines cytosine and thymine. Thymine is unique to DNA.

Individual nucleoside triphosphates combine with each other by covalent bonds known as 5-3 phosphodiester
bonds, or linkages whereby the phosphate group attached to the 5 carbon of the sugar of one nucleotide bonds to
the hydroxyl group of the 3 carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide. Phosphodiester bonding between
nucleotides forms the sugar-phosphate backbone, the alternating sugar-phosphate structure composing the
framework of a nucleic acid strand (Figure 10.13). During the polymerization process, deoxynucleotide
triphosphates (dNTP) are used. To construct the sugar-phosphate backbone, the two terminal phosphates are
released from the dNTP as a pyrophosphate. The resulting strand of nucleic acid has a free phosphate group at the
5 carbon end and a free hydroxyl group at the 3 carbon end. The two unused phosphate groups from the
nucleotide triphosphate are released as pyrophosphate during phosphodiester bond formation. Pyrophosphate is
subsequently hydrolyzed, releasing the energy used to drive nucleotide polymerization.

     Discovering the Double Helix

     By the early 1950s, considerable evidence had accumulated indicating that DNA was the genetic material of cells,
     and now the race was on to discover its three-dimensional structure. Around this time, Austrian biochemist Erwin
     Chargaff5 (1905-2002) examined the content of DNA in different species and discovered that adenine, thymine,
     guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between
     individuals of the same species. He found that the amount of adenine was very close to equaling the amount of
     thymine, and the amount of cytosine was very close to equaling the amount of guanine, or A = T and G = C. These
     relationships are also known as Chargaff's rules.
     Other scientists were also actively exploring this field during the mid-20th century. In 1952, American scientist
     Linus Pauling (1901-1994) was the world's leading structural chemist and odds-on favorite to solve the structure of
     DNA. Pauling had earlier discovered the structure of protein  helices, using X-ray diffraction, and, based upon X-ray
     diffraction images of DNA made in his laboratory, he proposed a triple-stranded model of DNA.6 At the same time,
     British researchers Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) and her graduate student R.G. Gosling were also using X-ray
     diffraction to understand the structure of DNA (Figure 10.14). It was Franklin's scientific expertise that resulted in
     the production of more well-defined X-ray diffraction images of DNA that would clearly show the overall double-
     helix structure of DNA.

James Watson (1928-), an American scientist, and Francis Crick (1916-2004), a British scientist, were working
together in the 1950s to discover DNA's structure. They used Chargaff's rules and Franklin and Wilkins' X-ray
diffraction images of DNA fibers to piece together the purine-pyrimidine pairing of the double helical DNA molecule
(Figure 10.15). In April 1953, Watson and Crick published their model of the DNA double helix in Nature.7 The same
issue additionally included papers by Wilkins and colleagues,8 as well as by Franklin and Gosling,9 each describing
different aspects of the molecular structure of DNA. In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins
were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Unfortunately, by then Franklin had died, and Nobel
prizes at the time were not awarded posthumously. Work continued, however, on learning about the structure of
DNA. In 1973, Alexander Rich (1924-2015) and colleagues were able to analyze DNA crystals to confirm and
further elucidate DNA structure.10

     DNA Structure

     Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-
     handed helix. The two DNA strands are antiparallel, such that the 3 end of one strand faces the 5 end of the other
     (Figure 10.16). The 3 end of each strand has a free hydroxyl group, while the 5 end of each strand has a free
     phosphate group. The sugar and phosphate of the polymerized nucleotides form the backbone of the structure,
     whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. These nitrogenous bases on the interior of the molecule interact
     with each other, base pairing.

     Analysis of the diffraction patterns of DNA has determined that there are approximately 10 bases per turn in DNA.
     The asymmetrical spacing of the sugar-phosphate backbones generates major grooves (where the backbone is far
     apart) and minor grooves (where the backbone is close together) (Figure 10.16). These grooves are locations where
     proteins can bind to DNA. The binding of these proteins can alter the structure of DNA, regulate replication, or
     regulate transcription of DNA into RNA.

     FIGURE 10.16 Watson and Crick proposed the double helix model for DNA. (a) The sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside of the
     double helix and purines and pyrimidines form the "rungs" of the DNA helix ladder. (b) The two DNA strands are antiparallel to each other.
     (c) The direction of each strand is identified by numbering the carbons (1 through 5) in each sugar molecule. The 5 end is the one where
     carbon #5 is not bound to another nucleotide; the 3 end is the one where carbon #3 is not bound to another nucleotide.

     Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine. In DNA, adenine (A) and thymine (T) are complementary
     base pairs, and cytosine (C) and guanine (G) are also complementary base pairs, explaining Chargaff's rules (Figure
     10.17). The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds between
     them, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds between them.

In the laboratory, exposing the two DNA strands of the double helix to high temperatures or to certain chemicals can
break the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, thus separating the strands into two separate single
strands of DNA (single-stranded DNA [ssDNA]). This process is called DNA denaturation and is analogous to protein
denaturation, as described in Proteins. The ssDNA strands can also be put back together as double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA), through reannealing or renaturing by cooling or removing the chemical denaturants, allowing these
hydrogen bonds to reform. The ability to artificially manipulate DNA in this way is the basis for several important
techniques in biotechnology (Figure 10.18). Because of the additional hydrogen bonding between the C = G base
pair, DNA with a high GC content is more difficult to denature than DNA with a lower GC content.

     EYE ON ETHICS

     Paving the Way for Women in Science and Health Professions

     Historically, women have been underrepresented in the sciences and in medicine, and often their pioneering
     contributions have gone relatively unnoticed. For example, although Rosalind Franklin performed the X-ray
     diffraction studies demonstrating the double helical structure of DNA, it is Watson and Crick who became
     famous for this discovery, building on her data. There still remains great controversy over whether their
     acquisition of her data was appropriate and whether personality conflicts and gender bias contributed to the
     delayed recognition of her significant contributions. Similarly, Barbara McClintock did pioneering work in maize
     (corn) genetics from the 1930s through 1950s, discovering transposons (jumping genes), but she was not
     recognized until much later, receiving a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983 (Figure 10.19).

     Today, women still remain underrepresented in many fields of science and medicine. While more than half of the
     undergraduate degrees in science are awarded to women, only 46% of doctoral degrees in science are awarded
     to women. In academia, the number of women at each level of career advancement continues to decrease, with
     women holding less than one-third of the positions of Ph.D.-level scientists in tenure-track positions, and less
     than one-quarter of the full professorships at 4-year colleges and universities.11 Even in the health professions,
     like nearly all other fields, women are often underrepresented in many medical careers and earn significantly
     less than their male counterparts, as shown in a 2013 study published by the Journal of the American Medical
     Association.12

     Why do such disparities continue to exist and how do we break these cycles? The situation is complex and likely
     results from the combination of various factors, including how society conditions the behaviors of girls from a
     young age and supports their interests, both professionally and personally. Some have suggested that women do
     not belong in the laboratory, including Nobel Prize winner Tim Hunt, whose 2015 public comments suggesting
     that women are too emotional for science13 were met with widespread condemnation.

     Perhaps girls should be supported more from a young age in the areas of science and math (Figure 10.19).
     Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs sponsored by the American Association of
     University Women (AAUW)14 and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)15 are excellent
     examples of programs that offer such support. Contributions by women in science should be made known more
     widely to the public, and marketing targeted to young girls should include more images of historically and
     professionally successful female scientists and medical professionals, encouraging all bright young minds,
     including girls and women, to pursue careers in science and medicine.

CLINICAL FOCUS

Part 2

Based upon his symptoms, Alex's physician suspects that he is suffering from a foodborne illness that he
acquired during his travels. Possibilities include bacterial infection (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio cholerae,
Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella), viral infection (rotavirus or norovirus), or protozoan infection (Giardia
lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, or Entamoeba histolytica).

His physician orders a stool sample to identify possible causative agents (e.g., bacteria, cysts) and to look for the
presence of blood because certain types of infectious agents (like C. jejuni, Salmonella, and E. histolytica) are
associated with the production of bloody stools.

Alex's stool sample showed neither blood nor cysts. Following analysis of his stool sample and based upon his
recent travel history, the hospital physician suspected that Alex was suffering from traveler's diarrhea caused by
enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), the causative agent of most traveler's diarrhea. To verify the diagnosis and rule
out other possibilities, Alex's physician ordered a diagnostic lab test of his stool sample to look for DNA
sequences encoding specific virulence factors of ETEC. The physician instructed Alex to drink lots of fluids to
replace what he was losing and discharged him from the hospital.

ETEC produces several plasmid-encoded virulence factors that make it pathogenic compared with typical E. coli.
These include the secreted toxins heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and heat-stabile enterotoxin (ST), as well as
colonization factor (CF). Both LT and ST cause the excretion of chloride ions from intestinal cells to the intestinal
lumen, causing a consequent loss of water from intestinal cells, resulting in diarrhea. CF encodes a bacterial
protein that aids in allowing the bacterium to adhere to the lining of the small intestine.

        or direct Gram stain of the stool sample alone?

     10.3 Structure and Function of RNA

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the biochemical structure of ribonucleotides
         · Describe the similarities and differences between RNA and DNA
         · Describe the functions of the three main types of RNA used in protein synthesis
         · Explain how RNA can serve as hereditary information

     Structurally speaking, ribonucleic acid (RNA), is quite similar to DNA. However, whereas DNA molecules are
     typically long and double stranded, RNA molecules are much shorter and are typically single stranded. RNA
     molecules perform a variety of roles in the cell but are mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis
     (translation) and its regulation.

     RNA Structure

     RNA is typically single stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. A
     ribonucleotide in the RNA chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (A, U, G, and
     C), and a phosphate group. The subtle structural difference between the sugars gives DNA added stability, making
     DNA more suitable for storage of genetic information, whereas the relative instability of RNA makes it more suitable
     for its more short-term functions. The RNA-specific pyrimidine uracil forms a complementary base pair with
     adenine and is used instead of the thymine used in DNA. Even though RNA is single stranded, most types of RNA
     molecules show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences within the RNA strand,
     creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function (Figure 10.20 and Figure 10.21).

Functions of RNA in Protein Synthesis

Cells access the information stored in DNA by creating RNA to direct the synthesis of proteins through the process of
translation. Proteins within a cell have many functions, including building cellular structures and serving as enzyme
catalysts for cellular chemical reactions that give cells their specific characteristics. The three main types of RNA
directly involved in protein synthesis are messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA
(tRNA).
In 1961, French scientists François Jacob and Jacques Monod hypothesized the existence of an intermediary
between DNA and its protein products, which they called messenger RNA.16 Evidence supporting their hypothesis
was gathered soon afterwards showing that information from DNA is transmitted to the ribosome for protein
synthesis using mRNA. If DNA serves as the complete library of cellular information, mRNA serves as a photocopy of
specific information needed at a particular point in time that serves as the instructions to make a protein.
The mRNA carries the message from the DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires a
certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is "turned on" and the mRNA is synthesized through the
process of transcription (see RNA Transcription). The mRNA then interacts with ribosomes and other cellular
machinery (Figure 10.22) to direct the synthesis of the protein it encodes during the process of translation (see
Protein Synthesis). mRNA is relatively unstable and short-lived in the cell, especially in prokaryotic cells, ensuring
that proteins are only made when needed.

                           FIGURE 10.22 A generalized illustration of how mRNA and tRNA are used in protein synthesis within a cell.

     rRNA and tRNA are stable types of RNA. In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, tRNA and rRNA are encoded in the DNA,
     then copied into long RNA molecules that are cut to release smaller fragments containing the individual mature RNA
     species. In eukaryotes, synthesis, cutting, and assembly of rRNA into ribosomes takes place in the nucleolus region
     of the nucleus, but these activities occur in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes. Neither of these types of RNA carries
     instructions to direct the synthesis of a polypeptide, but they play other important roles in protein synthesis.

     Ribosomes are composed of rRNA and protein. As its name suggests, rRNA is a major constituent of ribosomes,
     composing up to about 60% of the ribosome by mass and providing the location where the mRNA binds. The rRNA
     ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA, tRNA, and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an
     enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned
     amino acids during protein synthesis. Although rRNA had long been thought to serve primarily a structural role, its
     catalytic role within the ribosome was proven in 2000.17 Scientists in the laboratories of Thomas Steitz (1940-) and
     Peter Moore (1939-) at Yale University were able to crystallize the ribosome structure from Haloarcula marismortui,
     a halophilic archaeon isolated from the Dead Sea. Because of the importance of this work, Steitz shared the 2009
     Nobel Prize in Chemistry with other scientists who made significant contributions to the understanding of ribosome
     structure.

     Transfer RNA is the third main type of RNA and one of the smallest, usually only 70-90 nucleotides long. It carries
     the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis in the ribosome. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and
     mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain being synthesized (Figure
     10.23). Any mutations in the tRNA or rRNA can result in global problems for the cell because both are necessary for
     proper protein synthesis (Table 10.1).

viruses that do not contain DNA. Thus, RNA clearly does have the additional capacity to serve as genetic

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define gene and genotype and differentiate genotype from phenotype
         · Describe chromosome structure and packaging
         · Compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic chromosomes
         · Explain why extrachromosomal DNA is important in a cell

     Thus far, we have discussed the structure and function of individual pieces of DNA and RNA. In this section, we will
     discuss how all of an organism's genetic material--collectively referred to as its genome--is organized inside of the
     cell. Since an organism's genetics to a large extent dictate its characteristics, it should not be surprising that
     organisms differ in the arrangement of their DNA and RNA.

     Genotype versus Phenotype

     All cellular activities are encoded within a cell's DNA. The sequence of bases within a DNA molecule represents the
     genetic information of the cell. Segments of DNA molecules are called genes, and individual genes contain the
     instructional code necessary for synthesizing various proteins, enzymes, or stable RNA molecules.

     The full collection of genes that a cell contains within its genome is called its genotype. However, a cell does not
     express all of its genes simultaneously. Instead, it turns on (expresses) or turns off certain genes when necessary.
     The set of genes being expressed at any given point in time determines the cell's activities and its observable
     characteristics, referred to as its phenotype. Genes that are always expressed are known as constitutive genes;
     some constitutive genes are known as housekeeping genes because they are necessary for the basic functions of
     the cell.

     While the genotype of a cell remains constant, the phenotype may change in response to environmental signals
     (e.g., changes in temperature or nutrient availability) that affect which nonconstitutive genes are expressed. For
     example, the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans produces a sticky slime layer that allows it to adhere to teeth,
     forming dental plaque; however, the genes that control the production of the slime layer are only expressed in the
     presence of sucrose (table sugar). Thus, while the genotype of S. mutans is constant, its phenotype changes
     depending on the presence and absence of sugar in its environment. Temperature can also regulate gene
     expression. For example, the gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens, a pathogen frequently associated with
     hospital-acquired infections, produces a red pigment at 28 °C but not at 37 °C, the normal internal temperature of
     the human body (Figure 10.24).

Organization of Genetic Material

The vast majority of an organism's genome is organized into the cell's chromosomes, which are discrete DNA
structures within cells that control cellular activity. Recall that while eukaryotic chromosomes are housed in the
membrane-bound nucleus, most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the
cytoplasm called the nucleoid (see Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells). A chromosome may contain several
thousand genes.

Organization of Eukaryotic Chromosome
Chromosome structure differs somewhat between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic chromosomes are
typically linear, and eukaryotic cells contain multiple distinct chromosomes. Many eukaryotic cells contain two
copies of each chromosome and, therefore, are diploid.

The length of a chromosome greatly exceeds the length of the cell, so a chromosome needs to be packaged into a
very small space to fit within the cell. For example, the combined length of all of the 3 billion base pairs18 of DNA of
the human genome would measure approximately 2 meters if completely stretched out, and some eukaryotic
genomes are many times larger than the human genome. DNA supercoiling refers to the process by which DNA is
twisted to fit inside the cell. Supercoiling may result in DNA that is either underwound (less than one turn of the
helix per 10 base pairs) or overwound (more than one turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Proteins
known to be involved in supercoiling include topoisomerases; these enzymes help maintain the structure of
supercoiled chromosomes, preventing overwinding of DNA during certain cellular processes like DNA replication.

During DNA packaging, DNA-binding proteins called histones perform various levels of DNA wrapping and
attachment to scaffolding proteins. The combination of DNA with these attached proteins is referred to as
chromatin. In eukaryotes, the packaging of DNA by histones may be influenced by environmental factors that affect
the presence of methyl groups on certain cytosine nucleotides of DNA. The influence of environmental factors on
DNA packaging is called epigenetics. Epigenetics is another mechanism for regulating gene expression without
altering the sequence of nucleotides. Epigenetic changes can be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division
and, therefore, can be heritable.

     Organization of Prokaryotic Chromosomes
     Chromosomes in bacteria and archaea are usually circular, and a prokaryotic cell typically contains only a single
     chromosome within the nucleoid. Because the chromosome contains only one copy of each gene, prokaryotes are
     haploid. As in eukaryotic cells, DNA supercoiling is necessary for the genome to fit within the prokaryotic cell. The
     DNA in the bacterial chromosome is arranged in several supercoiled domains. As with eukaryotes, topoisomerases
     are involved in supercoiling DNA. DNA gyrase is a type of topoisomerase, found in bacteria and some archaea, that
     helps prevent the overwinding of DNA. (Some antibiotics kill bacteria by targeting DNA gyrase.) In addition, histone-
     like proteins bind DNA and aid in DNA packaging. Other proteins bind to the origin of replication, the location in the
     chromosome where DNA replication initiates. Because different regions of DNA are packaged differently, some
     regions of chromosomal DNA are more accessible to enzymes and thus may be used more readily as templates for
     gene expression. Interestingly, several bacteria, including Helicobacter pylori and Shigella flexneri, have been
     shown to induce epigenetic changes in their hosts upon infection, leading to chromatin remodeling that may cause
     long-term effects on host immunity.19

     Noncoding DNA

     In addition to genes, a genome also contains many regions of noncoding DNA that do not encode proteins or stable
     RNA products. Noncoding DNA is commonly found in areas prior to the start of coding sequences of genes as well as
     in intergenic regions (i.e., DNA sequences located between genes) (Figure 10.25).

                    FIGURE 10.25 Chromosomes typically have a significant amount of noncoding DNA, often found in intergenic regions.

     Prokaryotes appear to use their genomes very efficiently, with only an average of 12% of the genome being taken up
     by noncoding sequences. In contrast, noncoding DNA can represent about 98% of the genome in eukaryotes, as
     seen in humans, but the percentage of noncoding DNA varies between species.20 These noncoding DNA regions
     were once referred to as "junk DNA"; however, this terminology is no longer widely accepted because scientists
     have since found roles for some of these regions, many of which contribute to the regulation of transcription or
     translation through the production of small noncoding RNA molecules, DNA packaging, and chromosomal stability.
     Although scientists may not fully understand the roles of all noncoding regions of DNA, it is generally believed that
     they do have purposes within the cell.

Extrachromosomal DNA

Although most DNA is contained within a cell's chromosomes, many cells have additional molecules of DNA outside
the chromosomes, called extrachromosomal DNA, that are also part of its genome. The genomes of eukaryotic
cells would also include the chromosomes from any organelles such as mitochondria and/or chloroplasts that these
cells maintain (Figure 10.26). The maintenance of circular chromosomes in these organelles is a vestige of their
prokaryotic origins and supports the endosymbiotic theory (see Foundations of Modern Cell Theory). In some cases,
genomes of certain DNA viruses can also be maintained independently in host cells during latent viral infection. In
these cases, these viruses are another form of extrachromosomal DNA. For example, the human papillomavirus
(HPV) may be maintained in infected cells in this way.

FIGURE 10.26 The genome of a eukaryotic cell consists of the chromosome housed in the nucleus, and extrachromosomal DNA found in
the mitochondria (all cells) and chloroplasts (plants and algae). The cells shown in (b) represent cells obtained from a pap smear. The cells
on the left are normal squamous cells whereas the cells on the right are infected with human papillomavirus and show enlarged nuclei with
increased staining (hyperchromasia).

Besides chromosomes, some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that may contain one or a
few genes not essential for normal growth (Figure 3.12). Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria
in a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The exchange of genetic material on plasmids sometimes
provides microbes with new genes beneficial for growth and survival under special conditions. In some cases, genes
obtained from plasmids may have clinical implications, encoding virulence factors that give a microbe the ability to
cause disease or make a microbe resistant to certain antibiotics. Plasmids are also used heavily in genetic
engineering and biotechnology as a way to move genes from one cell to another. The role of plasmids in horizontal
gene transfer and biotechnology will be discussed further in Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics and Modern
Applications of Microbial Genetics.

  CASE IN POINT

  Lethal Plasmids

  Maria, a 20-year-old anthropology student from Texas, recently became ill in the African nation of Botswana,
  where she was conducting research as part of a study-abroad program. Maria's research was focused on
388  10 · Biochemistry of the Genome

     traditional African methods of tanning hides for the production of leather. Over a period of three weeks, she
     visited a tannery daily for several hours to observe and participate in the tanning process. One day, after
     returning from the tannery, Maria developed a fever, chills, and a headache, along with chest pain, muscle aches,
     nausea, and other flu-like symptoms. Initially, she was not concerned, but when her fever spiked and she began
     to cough up blood, her African host family became alarmed and rushed her to the hospital, where her condition
     continued to worsen.

     After learning about her recent work at the tannery, the physician suspected that Maria had been exposed to
     anthrax. He ordered a chest X-ray, a blood sample, and a spinal tap, and immediately started her on a course of
     intravenous penicillin. Unfortunately, lab tests confirmed the physician's presumptive diagnosis. Maria's chest X-
     ray exhibited pleural effusion, the accumulation of fluid in the space between the pleural membranes, and a
     Gram stain of her blood revealed the presence of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria in short chains, consistent
     with Bacillus anthracis. Blood and bacteria were also shown to be present in her cerebrospinal fluid, indicating
     that the infection had progressed to meningitis. Despite supportive treatment and aggressive antibiotic therapy,
     Maria slipped into an unresponsive state and died three days later.

     Anthrax is a disease caused by the introduction of endospores from the gram-positive bacterium B. anthracis
     into the body. Once infected, patients typically develop meningitis, often with fatal results. In Maria's case, she
     inhaled the endospores while handling the hides of animals that had been infected.

     The genome of B. anthracis illustrates how small structural differences can lead to major differences in
     virulence. In 2003, the genomes of B. anthracis and Bacillus cereus, a similar but less pathogenic bacterium of
     the same genus, were sequenced and compared.21 Researchers discovered that the 16S rRNA gene sequences
     of these bacteria are more than 99% identical, meaning that they are actually members of the same species
     despite their traditional classification as separate species. Although their chromosomal sequences also revealed
     a great deal of similarity, several virulence factors of B. anthracis were found to be encoded on two large
     plasmids not found in B. cereus. The plasmid pX01 encodes a three-part toxin that suppresses the host immune
     system, whereas the plasmid pX02 encodes a capsular polysaccharide that further protects the bacterium from
     the host immune system (Figure 10.27). Since B. cereus lacks these plasmids, it does not produce these
     virulence factors, and although it is still pathogenic, it is typically associated with mild cases of diarrhea from
     which the body can quickly recover. Unfortunately for Maria, the presence of these toxin-encoding plasmids in B.
     anthracis gives it its lethal virulence.

        FIGURE 10.27 Genome sequencing of Bacillus anthracis and its close relative B. cereus reveals that the pathogenicity of B. anthracis is
        due to the maintenance of two plasmids, pX01 and pX02, which encode virulence factors.

  heat-labile enterotoxin (LT), heat-stabile enterotoxin (ST), and colonization factor (CF), confirming the hospital
  physician's suspicion of ETEC. During a follow-up with Alex's family physician, this physician noted that Alex's
  symptoms were not resolving quickly and he was experiencing discomfort that was preventing him from
  returning to classes. The family physician prescribed Alex a course of ciprofloxacin to resolve his symptoms.
  Fortunately, the ciprofloxacin resolved Alex's symptoms within a few days.

  Alex likely got his infection from ingesting contaminated food or water. Emerging industrialized countries like
  Mexico are still developing sanitation practices that prevent the contamination of water with fecal material.
  Travelers in such countries should avoid the ingestion of undercooked foods, especially meats, seafood,
  vegetables, and unpasteurized dairy products. They should also avoid use of water that has not been treated;
  this includes drinking water, ice cubes, and even water used for brushing teeth. Using bottled water for these
  purposes is a good alternative. Good hygiene (handwashing) can also aid the prevention of an ETEC infection.
  Alex had not been careful about his food or water consumption, which led to his illness.

  Alex's symptoms were very similar to those of cholera, caused by the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae,
  which also produces a toxin similar to ST and LT. At some point in the evolutionary history of ETEC, a
  nonpathogenic strain of E. coli similar to those typically found in the gut may have acquired the genes encoding
  the ST and LT toxins from V. cholerae. The fact that the genes encoding those toxins are encoded on
  extrachromosomal plasmids in ETEC supports the idea that these genes were acquired by E. coli and are likely
  maintained in bacterial populations through horizontal gene transfer.

Viral Genomes

Viral genomes exhibit significant diversity in structure. Some viruses have genomes that consist of DNA as their
genetic material. This DNA may be single stranded, as exemplified by human parvoviruses, or double stranded, as
seen in the herpesviruses and poxviruses. Additionally, although all cellular life uses DNA as its genetic material,
some viral genomes are made of either single-stranded or double-stranded RNA molecules, as we have discussed.
Viral genomes are typically smaller than most bacterial genomes, encoding only a few genes, because they rely on
their hosts to carry out many of the functions required for their replication. The diversity of viral genome structures
and their implications for viral replication life cycles are discussed in more detail in The Viral Life Cycle.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Genome Size Matters

There is great variation in size of genomes among different organisms. Most eukaryotes maintain multiple
chromosomes; humans, for example have 23 pairs, giving them 46 chromosomes. Despite being large at 3 billion
base pairs, the human genome is far from the largest genome. Plants often maintain very large genomes, up to 150
billion base pairs, and commonly are polyploid, having multiple copies of each chromosome.

The size of bacterial genomes also varies considerably, although they tend to be smaller than eukaryotic genomes
(Figure 10.28). Some bacterial genomes may be as small as only 112,000 base pairs. Often, the size of a
bacterium's genome directly relates to how much the bacterium depends on its host for survival. When a bacterium
relies on the host cell to carry out certain functions, it loses the genes encoding the abilities to carry out those
functions itself. These types of bacterial endosymbionts are reminiscent of the prokaryotic origins of mitochondria
and chloroplasts.

From a clinical perspective, obligate and facultative intracellular pathogens also tend to have small genomes (some
390  10 · Biochemistry of the Genome

     around 1 million base pairs). Because host cells can supply most of their nutrients, they tend to have a reduced
     number of genes encoding metabolic functions, making their cultivation in the laboratory difficult if not impossible
     Due to their small sizes, the genomes of organisms like Mycoplasma genitalium (580,000 base pairs), Chlamydia
     trachomatis (1.0 million), Rickettsia prowazekii (1.1 million), and Treponema pallidum (1.1 million) were some of the
     earlier bacterial genomes sequenced. Respectively, these pathogens cause urethritis and pelvic inflammation,
     chlamydia, typhus, and syphilis.

     Whereas obligate intracellular pathogens have unusually small genomes, other bacteria with a great variety of
     metabolic and enzymatic capabilities have unusually large bacterial genomes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for
     example, is a bacterium commonly found in the environment and is able to grow on a wide range of substrates. Its
     genome contains 6.3 million base pairs, giving it a high metabolic ability and the ability to produce virulence factors
     that cause several types of opportunistic infections.

     Interestingly, there has been significant variability in genome size in viruses as well, ranging from 3,500 base pairs
     to 2.5 million base pairs, significantly exceeding the size of many bacterial genomes. The great variation observed in
     viral genome sizes further contributes to the great diversity of viral genome characteristics already discussed.

             FIGURE 10.28 There is great variability as well as overlap among the genome sizes of various groups of organisms and viruses.

INTRODUCTION In 1954, French scientist and future Nobel laureate Jacques Monod (1910-1976) famously said,
"What is true in E. coli is true in the elephant," suggesting that the biochemistry of life was maintained throughout
evolution and is shared in all forms of known life. Since Monod's famous statement, we have learned a great deal
about the mechanisms of gene regulation, expression, and replication in living cells. All cells use DNA for
information storage, share the same genetic code, and use similar mechanisms to replicate and express it. Although
many aspects of genetics are universally shared, variations do exist among contemporary genetic systems. We now
know that within the shared overall theme of the genetic mechanism, there are significant differences among the
three domains of life: Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria. Additionally, viruses, cellular parasites but not themselves
living cells, show dramatic variation in their genetic material and the replication and gene expression processes.
Some of these differences have allowed us to engineer clinical tools such as antibiotics and antiviral drugs that
specifically inhibit the reproduction of pathogens yet are harmless to their hosts.

       Mark is 60-year-old software engineer who suffers from type II diabetes, which he monitors and keeps under
       control largely through diet and exercise. One spring morning, while doing some gardening, he scraped his lower
       leg while walking through blackberry brambles. He continued working all day in the yard and did not bother to
       clean the wound and treat it with antibiotic ointment until later that evening. For the next 2 days, his leg became
       increasingly red, swollen, and warm to the touch. It was sore not only on the surface, but deep in the muscle.
       After 24 hours, Mark developed a fever and stiffness in the affected leg. Feeling increasingly weak, he called a
       neighbor, who drove him to the emergency department.

     DNA serves two essential functions that deal with cellular information. First, DNA is the genetic material responsible
     for inheritance and is passed from parent to offspring for all life on earth. To preserve the integrity of this genetic
     information, DNA must be replicated with great accuracy, with minimal errors that introduce changes to the DNA
     sequence. A genome contains the full complement of DNA within a cell and is organized into smaller, discrete units
     called genes that are arranged on chromosomes and plasmids. The second function of DNA is to direct and regulate
     the construction of the proteins necessary to a cell for growth and reproduction in a particular cellular environment.

     A gene is composed of DNA that is "read" or transcribed to produce an RNA molecule during the process of
     transcription. One major type of RNA molecule, called messenger RNA (mRNA), provides the information for the
     ribosome to catalyze protein synthesis in a process called translation. The processes of transcription and translation
     are collectively referred to as gene expression. Gene expression is the synthesis of a specific protein with a
     sequence of amino acids that is encoded in the gene. The flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein is
     described by the central dogma (Figure 11.2). This central dogma of molecular biology further elucidates the
     mechanism behind Beadle and Tatum's "one gene-one enzyme" hypothesis (see Using Microorganisms to Discover
     the Secrets of Life). Each of the processes of replication, transcription, and translation includes the stages of 1)
     initiation, 2) elongation (polymerization), and 3) termination. These stages will be described in more detail in this
     chapter.

                          FIGURE 11.2 The central dogma states that DNA encodes messenger RNA, which, in turn, encodes protein.

     A cell's genotype is the full collection of genes it contains, whereas its phenotype is the set of observable
     characteristics that result from those genes. The phenotype is the product of the array of proteins being produced
     by the cell at a given time, which is influenced by the cell's genotype as well as interactions with the cell's
     environment. Genes code for proteins that have functions in the cell. Production of a specific protein encoded by an
     individual gene often results in a distinct phenotype for the cell compared with the phenotype without that protein.
     For this reason, it is also common to refer to the genotype of an individual gene and its phenotype. Although a cell's
     genotype remains constant, not all genes are used to direct the production of their proteins simultaneously. Cells
     carefully regulate expression of their genes, only using genes to make specific proteins when those proteins are
     needed (Figure 11.3).

  EYE ON ETHICS

  Use and Abuse of Genome Data

  Why can some humans harbor opportunistic pathogens like Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, or
  Streptococcus pyogenes, in their upper respiratory tracts but remain asymptomatic carriers, while other
  individuals become seriously ill when infected? There is evidence suggesting that differences in susceptibility to
  infection between patients may be a result, at least in part, of genetic differences between human hosts. For
  example, genetic differences in human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and red blood cell antigens among hosts have
  been implicated in different immune responses and resulting disease progression from infection with H.
  influenzae.

  Because the genetic interplay between pathogen and host may contribute to disease outcomes, understanding
  differences in genetic makeup between individuals may be an important clinical tool. Ecological genomics is a
  relatively new field that seeks to understand how the genotypes of different organisms interact with each other
  in nature. The field answers questions about how gene expression of one organism affects gene expression of
  another. Medical applications of ecological genomics will focus on how pathogens interact with specific
  individuals, as opposed to humans in general. Such analyses would allow medical professionals to use
  knowledge of an individual's genotype to apply more individualized plans for treatment and prevention of
  disease.

  With the advent of next-generation sequencing, it is relatively easy to obtain the entire genomic sequences of
  pathogens; a bacterial genome can be sequenced in as little as a day.1 The speed and cost of sequencing the
  human genome has also been greatly reduced and, already, individuals can submit samples to receive extensive
  reports on their personal genetic traits, including ancestry and carrier status for various genetic diseases. As
  sequencing technologies progress further, such services will continue to become less expensive, more
  extensive, and quicker.

  However, as this day quickly approaches, there are many ethical concerns with which society must grapple. For
  example, should genome sequencing be a standard practice for everybody? Should it be required by law or by
  employers if it will lower health-care costs? If one refuses genome sequencing, do they forfeit their right to
  health insurance coverage? For what purposes should the data be used? Who should oversee proper use of
  these data? If genome sequencing reveals predisposition to a particular disease, do insurance companies have
  the right to increase rates? Will employers treat an employee differently? Knowing that environmental influences

     also affect disease development, how should the data on the presence of a particular disease-causing allele in
     an individual be used ethically? The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) currently
     prohibits discriminatory practices based on genetic information by both health insurance companies and
     employers. However, GINA does not cover life, disability, or long-term care insurance policies. Clearly, all
     members of society must continue to engage in conversations about these issues so that such genomic data can
     be used to improve health care while simultaneously protecting an individual's rights.

     11.2 DNA Replication

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the meaning of semiconservative DNA replication
         · Explain why DNA replication is bidirectional and includes both a leading and lagging strand
         · Explain why Okazaki fragments are formed

         · Explain the process of rolling circle replication

     The elucidation of the structure of the double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 provided a hint as to
     how DNA is copied during the process of replication. Separating the strands of the double helix would provide two
     templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands, but exactly how new DNA molecules were constructed
     was still unclear. In one model, semiconservative replication, the two strands of the double helix separate during
     DNA replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied; after
     replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or "old" strand and one "new" strand. There were two
     competing models also suggested: conservative and dispersive, which are shown in Figure 11.4.

     FIGURE 11.4 There were three models suggested for DNA replication. In the conservative model, parental DNA strands (blue) remained
     associated in one DNA molecule while new daughter strands (red) remained associated in newly formed DNA molecules. In the
     semiconservative model, parental strands separated and directed the synthesis of a daughter strand, with each resulting DNA molecule
     being a hybrid of a parental strand and a daughter strand. In the dispersive model, all resulting DNA strands have regions of double-
     stranded parental DNA and regions of double-stranded daughter DNA.

     Matthew Meselson (1930-) and Franklin Stahl (1929-) devised an experiment in 1958 to test which of these
     models correctly represents DNA replication (Figure 11.5). They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium

containing a "heavy" isotope of nitrogen (15N) that was incorporated into nitrogenous bases and, eventually, into the
DNA. This labeled the parental DNA. The E. coli culture was then shifted into a medium containing 14N and allowed

to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was separated by
ultracentrifugation, during which the DNA formed bands according to its density. DNA grown in 15N would be
expected to form a band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one
generation of growth in 14N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown
exclusively in 15N or 14N. This suggested either a semiconservative or dispersive mode of replication. Some cells
were allowed to grow for one more generation in 14N and spun again. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two
generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and
the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a
semiconservative manner. If DNA replication was dispersive, a single purple band positioned closer to the red 1414
would have been observed, as more 14 was added in a dispersive manner to replace 15. Therefore, the other two

models were ruled out. As a result of this experiment, we now know that during DNA replication, each of the two

strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will

be complementary to the parental or "old" strand. The resulting DNA molecules have the same sequence and are

divided equally into the two daughter cells.

FIGURE 11.5 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (blue band)
was heavier than DNA grown in 14N (red band), and sedimented to a lower level on ultracentrifugation. After one round of replication, the
DNA sedimented halfway between the 15N and 14N levels (purple band), ruling out the conservative model of replication. After a second
round of replication, the dispersive model of replication was ruled out. These data supported the semiconservative replication model.

     DNA Replication in Bacteria

     DNA replication has been well studied in bacteria primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants
     that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs (Mbp) in a single circular chromosome and all of it is replicated in
     approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle
     bidirectionally (i.e., in both directions). This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The
     process is quite rapid and occurs with few errors.

     DNA replication uses a large number of proteins and enzymes (Table 11.1). One of the key players is the enzyme
     DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol. In bacteria, three main types of DNA polymerases are known: DNA pol I,
     DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I
     and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair. DNA pol III adds deoxyribonucleotides each complementary to a
     nucleotide on the template strand, one by one to the 3'-OH group of the growing DNA chain. The addition of these
     nucleotides requires energy. This energy is present in the bonds of three phosphate groups attached to each
     nucleotide (a triphosphate nucleotide), similar to how energy is stored in the phosphate bonds of adenosine
     triphosphate (ATP) (Figure 11.6). When the bond between the phosphates is broken and diphosphate is released,
     the energy released allows for the formation of a covalent phosphodiester bond by dehydration synthesis between
     the incoming nucleotide and the free 3'-OH group on the growing DNA strand.

     FIGURE 11.6 This structure shows the guanosine triphosphate deoxyribonucleotide that is incorporated into a growing DNA strand by
     cleaving the two end phosphate groups from the molecule and transferring the energy to the sugar phosphate bond. The other three
     nucleotides form analogous structures.

     Initiation
     The initiation of replication occurs at specific nucleotide sequence called the origin of replication, where various
     proteins bind to begin the replication process. E. coli has a single origin of replication (as do most prokaryotes),
     called oriC, on its one chromosome. The origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in
     adenine-thymine (AT) sequences.

     Some of the proteins that bind to the origin of replication are important in making single-stranded regions of DNA
     accessible for replication. Chromosomal DNA is typically wrapped around histones (in eukaryotes and archaea) or
     histone-like proteins (in bacteria), and is supercoiled, or extensively wrapped and twisted on itself. This packaging
     makes the information in the DNA molecule inaccessible. However, enzymes called topoisomerases change the
     shape and supercoiling of the chromosome. For bacterial DNA replication to begin, the supercoiled chromosome is
     relaxed by topoisomerase II, also called DNA gyrase. An enzyme called helicase then separates the DNA strands
     by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. Recall that AT sequences have fewer hydrogen
     bonds and, hence, have weaker interactions than guanine-cytosine (GC) sequences. These enzymes require ATP
     hydrolysis. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are
     formed at the origin of replication, allowing for bidirectional replication and formation of a structure that looks like a
     bubble when viewed with a transmission electron microscope; as a result, this structure is called a replication
     bubble. The DNA near each replication fork is coated with single-stranded binding proteins to prevent the single-
     stranded DNA from rewinding into a double helix.

     Once single-stranded DNA is accessible at the origin of replication, DNA replication can begin. However, DNA pol III
     is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction).
     This is because DNA polymerase requires a free 3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a covalent
     phosphodiester bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide. This also means that it
     cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group is not available, which is the case for a single strand of DNA. The
     problem is solved with the help of an RNA sequence that provides the free 3'-OH end. Because this sequence allows
     the start of DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. The primer is five to 10 nucleotides long and

     Access for free at openstax.org
11.2 · DNA Replication                                                                                                     403

complementary to the parental or template DNA. It is synthesized by RNA primase, which is an RNA polymerase.
Unlike DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases do not need a free 3'-OH group to synthesize an RNA molecule. Now
that the primer provides the free 3'-OH group, DNA polymerase III can now extend this RNA primer, adding DNA
nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand (Figure 11.4).

Elongation
During elongation in DNA replication, the addition of nucleotides occurs at its maximal rate of about 1000
nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase III can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, which poses a problem at the
replication fork. The DNA double helix is antiparallel; that is, one strand is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction and the
other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction (see Structure and Function of DNA). During replication, one strand, which is
complementary to the 3' to 5' parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork because
polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading
strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, grows away from the replication fork, so the
polymerase must move back toward the replication fork to begin adding bases to a new primer, again in the direction
away from the replication fork. It does so until it bumps into the previously synthesized strand and then it moves
back again (Figure 11.7). These steps produce small DNA sequence fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each
separated by RNA primer. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese research team and married couple Reiji
and Tsuneko Okazaki, who first discovered them in 1966. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the
lagging strand, and its synthesis is said to be discontinuous.

The leading strand can be extended from one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each
of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading
strand 5' to 3'. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add
nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place.
Beyond its role in initiation, topoisomerase also prevents the overwinding of the DNA double helix ahead of the
replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing
it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease
activity of DNA polymerase I, and the gaps are filled in. The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA
(that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that
catalyzes the formation of covalent phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one DNA fragment and the 5'
phosphate end of the other fragment, stabilizing the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule.
404  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     FIGURE 11.7 At the origin of replication, topoisomerase II relaxes the supercoiled chromosome. Two replication forks are formed by the
     opening of the double-stranded DNA at the origin, and helicase separates the DNA strands, which are coated by single-stranded binding
     proteins to keep the strands separated. DNA replication occurs in both directions. An RNA primer complementary to the parental strand is
     synthesized by RNA primase and is elongated by DNA polymerase III through the addition of nucleotides to the 3'-OH end. On the leading
     strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments.
     RNA primers within the lagging strand are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, and the Okazaki fragments are joined
     by DNA ligase.

     Termination
     Once the complete chromosome has been replicated, termination of DNA replication must occur. Although much is
     known about initiation of replication, less is known about the termination process. Following replication, the
     resulting complete circular genomes of prokaryotes are concatenated, meaning that the circular DNA chromosomes
     are interlocked and must be separated from each other. This is accomplished through the activity of bacterial
     topoisomerase IV, which introduces double-stranded breaks into DNA molecules, allowing them to separate from
     each other; the enzyme then reseals the circular chromosomes. The resolution of concatemers is an issue unique to
     prokaryotic DNA replication because of their circular chromosomes. Because both bacterial DNA gyrase and
     topoisomerase IV are distinct from their eukaryotic counterparts, these enzymes serve as targets for a class of
     antimicrobial drugs called quinolones.

DNA Replication in Eukaryotes

Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger than prokaryotic genomes and are typically composed of
multiple linear chromosomes (Table 11.2). The human genome, for example, has 3 billion base pairs per haploid set
of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are inserted during replication. There are multiple origins of replication on
each eukaryotic chromosome (Figure 11.8); the human genome has 30,000 to 50,000 origins of replication. The
rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second--10 times slower than prokaryotic replication.
406  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

                          FIGURE 11.8 Eukaryotic chromosomes are typically linear, and each contains multiple origins of replication.

     The essential steps of replication in eukaryotes are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA
     has to be made available as a template. Eukaryotic DNA is highly supercoiled and packaged, which is facilitated by
     many proteins, including histones (see Structure and Function of Cellular Genomes). At the origin of replication, a
     prereplication complex composed of several proteins, including helicase, forms and recruits other enzymes involved
     in the initiation of replication, including topoisomerase to relax supercoiling, single-stranded binding protein, RNA
     primase, and DNA polymerase. Following initiation of replication, in a process similar to that found in prokaryotes,
     elongation is facilitated by eukaryotic DNA polymerases. The leading strand is continuously synthesized by the
     eukaryotic polymerase enzyme pol , while the lagging strand is synthesized by pol . A sliding clamp protein holds
     the DNA polymerase in place so that it does not fall off the DNA. The enzyme ribonuclease H (RNase H), instead of a
     DNA polymerase as in bacteria, removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides. The gaps
     that remain are sealed by DNA ligase.

     Because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, one might expect that their replication would be more straightforward.
     As in prokaryotes, the eukaryotic DNA polymerase can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. In the leading
     strand, synthesis continues until it reaches either the end of the chromosome or another replication fork progressing
     in the opposite direction. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a
     separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place to make a
     primer for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired and,
     over time, they may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.

     The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres and consist of noncoding repetitive sequences. The
     telomeres protect coding sequences from being lost as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base-pair
     sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times to form the telomere. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase
     (Figure 11.9) clarified our understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. Telomerase contains a catalytic
     part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA
     template are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently
     elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. In this way,
     the ends of the chromosomes are replicated. In humans, telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem
     cells; it is not active in adult somatic cells and may be associated with the aging of these cells. Eukaryotic microbes
     including fungi and protozoans also produce telomerase to maintain chromosomal integrity. For her discovery of
     telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (1948-) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 2009.

     DNA Replication of Extrachromosomal Elements: Plasmids and Viruses

     To copy their nucleic acids, plasmids and viruses frequently use variations on the pattern of DNA replication
     described for prokaryote genomes. For more information on the wide range of viral replication strategies, see The
     Viral Life Cycle.

     Rolling Circle Replication
     Whereas many bacterial plasmids (see Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells) replicate by a process similar to
     that used to copy the bacterial chromosome, other plasmids, several bacteriophages, and some viruses of
     eukaryotes use rolling circle replication (Figure 11.10). The circular nature of plasmids and the circularization of
     some viral genomes on infection make this possible. Rolling circle replication begins with the enzymatic nicking of
     one strand of the double-stranded circular molecule at the double-stranded origin (dso) site. In bacteria, DNA
     polymerase III binds to the 3'-OH group of the nicked strand and begins to unidirectionally replicate the DNA using
     the un-nicked strand as a template, displacing the nicked strand as it does so. Completion of DNA replication at the
     site of the original nick results in full displacement of the nicked strand, which may then recircularize into a single-
     stranded DNA molecule. RNA primase then synthesizes a primer to initiate DNA replication at the single-stranded
     origin (sso) site of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule, resulting in a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
     molecule identical to the other circular DNA molecule.

11.3 · RNA Transcription                                                                                                                 409

During the process of transcription, the information encoded within the DNA sequence of one or more genes is
transcribed into a strand of RNA, also called an RNA transcript. The resulting single-stranded RNA molecule,
composed of ribonucleotides containing the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U), acts as a
mobile molecular copy of the original DNA sequence. Transcription in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes requires the
DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of RNA synthesis. The unwound region is called a transcription
bubble. Transcription of a particular gene always proceeds from one of the two DNA strands that acts as a template,
the so-called antisense strand. The RNA product is complementary to the template strand of DNA and is almost
identical to the nontemplate DNA strand, or the sense strand. The only difference is that in RNA, all of the T
nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides; during RNA synthesis, U is incorporated when there is an A in the
complementary antisense strand.

Transcription in Bacteria

Bacteria use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. Like DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase
adds nucleotides one by one to the 3'-OH group of the growing nucleotide chain. One critical difference in activity
between DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase is the requirement for a 3'-OH onto which to add nucleotides: DNA
polymerase requires such a 3'-OH group, thus necessitating a primer, whereas RNA polymerase does not. During
transcription, a ribonucleotide complementary to the DNA template strand is added to the growing RNA strand and
a covalent phosphodiester bond is formed by dehydration synthesis between the new nucleotide and the last one
added. In E. coli, RNA polymerase comprises six polypeptide subunits, five of which compose the polymerase core
enzyme responsible for adding RNA nucleotides to a growing strand. The sixth subunit is known as sigma (). The 
factor enables RNA polymerase to bind to a specific promoter, thus allowing for the transcription of various genes.
There are various  factors that allow for transcription of various genes.

Initiation
The initiation of transcription begins at a promoter, a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds
and initiates transcription. The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site from which the
first 5' RNA nucleotide is transcribed is the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are designated
"upstream," whereas nucleotides following the initiation site are called "downstream" nucleotides. In most cases,
promoters are located just upstream of the genes they regulate. Although promoter sequences vary among bacterial
genomes, a few elements are conserved. At the -10 and -35 positions within the DNA prior to the initiation site
(designated +1), there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and
across various bacterial species. The -10 consensus sequence, called the TATA box, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence is
recognized and bound by .

Elongation
The elongation in transcription phase begins when the  subunit dissociates from the polymerase, allowing the
core enzyme to synthesize RNA complementary to the DNA template in a 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately
40 nucleotides per second. As elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme
and rewound behind it (Figure 11.11).

FIGURE 11.11 During elongation, the bacterial RNA polymerase tracks along the DNA template, synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction,
and unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.
410  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     Termination
     Once a gene is transcribed, the bacterial polymerase must dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly
     made RNA. This is referred to as termination of transcription. The DNA template includes repeated nucleotide
     sequences that act as termination signals, causing RNA polymerase to stall and release from the DNA template,
     freeing the RNA transcript.

     Transcription in Eukaryotes

     Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few significant
     differences (see Table 11.3). Eukaryotes use three different polymerases, RNA polymerases I, II, and III, all
     structurally distinct from the bacterial RNA polymerase. Each transcribes a different subset of genes. Interestingly,
     archaea contain a single RNA polymerase that is more closely related to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II than to its
     bacterial counterpart. Eukaryotic mRNAs are also usually monocistronic, meaning that they each encode only a
     single polypeptide, whereas prokaryotic mRNAs of bacteria and archaea are commonly polycistronic, meaning that
     they encode multiple polypeptides.

     The most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter's membrane-bound nucleus, which
     influences the ease of use of RNA molecules for protein synthesis. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the
     eukaryotic cell must transport protein-encoding RNA molecules to the cytoplasm to be translated. Protein-encoding
     primary transcripts, the RNA molecules directly synthesized by RNA polymerase, must undergo several processing
     steps to protect these RNA molecules from degradation during the time they are transferred from the nucleus to the
     cytoplasm and translated into a protein. For example, eukaryotic mRNAs may last for several hours, whereas the
     typical prokaryotic mRNA lasts no more than 5 seconds.

     The primary transcript (also called pre-mRNA) is first coated with RNA-stabilizing proteins to protect it from
     degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. The first type of processing begins while the
     primary transcript is still being synthesized; a special 7-methylguanosine nucleotide, called the 5' cap, is added to
     the 5' end of the growing transcript. In addition to preventing degradation, factors involved in subsequent protein
     synthesis recognize the cap, which helps initiate translation by ribosomes. Once elongation is complete, another
     processing enzyme then adds a string of approximately 200 adenine nucleotides to the 3' end, called the poly-A
     tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals to cellular factors that the
     transcript needs to be exported to the cytoplasm.

     Eukaryotic genes that encode polypeptides are composed of coding sequences called exons (ex-on signifies that
     they are expressed) and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role). Transcribed
     RNA sequences corresponding to introns do not encode regions of the functional polypeptide and are removed from
     the pre-mRNA during processing. It is essential that all of the intron-encoded RNA sequences are completely and
     precisely removed from a pre-mRNA before protein synthesis so that the exon-encoded RNA sequences are
     properly joined together to code for a functional polypeptide. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the
     sequences of the rejoined exons would be shifted, and the resulting polypeptide would be nonfunctional. The
     process of removing intron-encoded RNA sequences and reconnecting those encoded by exons is called RNA
     splicing and is facilitated by the action of a spliceosome containing small nuclear ribonucleo proteins (snRNPs).
     Intron-encoded RNA sequences are removed from the pre-mRNA while it is still in the nucleus. Although they are
     not translated, introns appear to have various functions, including gene regulation and mRNA transport. On
     completion of these modifications, the mature transcript, the mRNA that encodes a polypeptide, is transported out
     of the nucleus, destined for the cytoplasm for translation. Introns can be spliced out differently, resulting in various
     exons being included or excluded from the final mRNA product. This process is known as alternative splicing. The
     advantage of alternative splicing is that different types of mRNA transcripts can be generated, all derived from the
     same DNA sequence. In recent years, it has been shown that some archaea also have the ability to splice their pre-

In the emergency department, a nurse told Mark that he had made a good decision to come to the hospital
because his symptoms indicated an infection that had gotten out of control. Mark's symptoms had progressed,
with the area of skin affected and the amount of swelling increasing. Within the affected area, a rash had begun,
blistering and small gas pockets underneath the outermost layer of skin had formed, and some of the skin was
becoming gray. Based on the putrid smell of the pus draining from one of the blisters, the rapid progression of
the infection, and the visual appearance of the affected skin, the physician immediately began treatment for
necrotizing fasciitis. Mark's physician ordered a culture of the fluid draining from the blister and also ordered
blood work, including a white blood cell count.

Mark was admitted to the intensive care unit and began intravenous administration of a broad-spectrum
antibiotic to try to minimize further spread of the infection. Despite antibiotic therapy, Mark's condition
deteriorated quickly. Mark became confused and dizzy. Within a few hours of his hospital admission, his blood
pressure dropped significantly and his breathing became shallower and more rapid. Additionally, blistering
increased, with the blisters intensifying in color to purplish black, and the wound itself seemed to be progressing

     11.4 Protein Synthesis (Translation)

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the genetic code and explain why it is considered almost universal
         · Explain the process of translation and the functions of the molecular machinery of translation
         · Compare translation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes

     The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell's energy than any other metabolic process. In turn, proteins
     account for more mass than any other macromolecule of living organisms. They perform virtually every function of a
     cell, serving as both functional (e.g., enzymes) and structural elements. The process of translation, or protein
     synthesis, the second part of gene expression, involves the decoding by a ribosome of an mRNA message into a
     polypeptide product.

     The Genetic Code

     Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into the "language" of amino
     acids to create a protein product. A protein sequence consists of 20 commonly occurring amino acids. Each amino
     acid is defined within the mRNA by a triplet of nucleotides called a codon. The relationship between an mRNA
     codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic code.

     The three-nucleotide code means that there is a total of 64 possible combinations (43, with four different
     nucleotides possible at each of the three different positions within the codon). This number is greater than the
     number of amino acids and a given amino acid is encoded by more than one codon (Figure 11.12). This redundancy
     in the genetic code is called degeneracy. Typically, whereas the first two positions in a codon are important for
     determining which amino acid will be incorporated into a growing polypeptide, the third position, called the wobble
     position, is less critical. In some cases, if the nucleotide in the third position is changed, the same amino acid is still
     incorporated.

     Whereas 61 of the 64 possible triplets code for amino acids, three of the 64 codons do not code for an amino acid;
     they terminate protein synthesis, releasing the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These are called stop
     codons or nonsense codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino
     acid methionine, it also typically serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame, the way
     nucleotides in mRNA are grouped into codons, for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the
     mRNA. Each set of three nucleotides following this start codon is a codon in the mRNA message.

     The genetic code is nearly universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for
     protein synthesis, which is powerful evidence that all extant life on earth shares a common origin. However, unusual
     amino acids such as selenocysteine and pyrrolysine have been observed in archaea and bacteria. In the case of
     selenocysteine, the codon used is UGA (normally a stop codon). However, UGA can encode for selenocysteine using
     a stem-loop structure (known as the selenocysteine insertion sequence, or SECIS element), which is found at the 3'
     untranslated region of the mRNA. Pyrrolysine uses a different stop codon, UAG. The incorporation of pyrrolysine
     requires the pylS gene and a unique transfer RNA (tRNA) with a CUA anticodon.

The Protein Synthesis Machinery

In addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation.
The composition of each component varies across taxa; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of
ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and polypeptides depending on the organism. However, the general structures and
functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the
input of an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.

Ribosomes
A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of catalytic rRNAs (called ribozymes) and structural rRNAs, as
well as many distinct polypeptides. Mature rRNAs make up approximately 50% of each ribosome. Prokaryotes have
70S ribosomes, whereas eukaryotes have 80S ribosomes in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and
70S ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are
not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In E. coli, the small subunit is
described as 30S (which contains the 16S rRNA subunit), and the large subunit is 50S (which contains the 5S and
23S rRNA subunits), for a total of 70S (Svedberg units are not additive). Eukaryote ribosomes have a small 40S
subunit (which contains the 18S rRNA subunit) and a large 60S subunit (which contains the 5S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA
subunits), for a total of 80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large
subunit binds tRNAs (discussed in the next subsection).

Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same
direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus.
The complete structure containing an mRNA with multiple associated ribosomes is called a polyribosome (or
polysome). In both bacteria and archaea, before transcriptional termination occurs, each protein-encoding
transcript is already being used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded polypeptide(s) because the
processes of transcription and translation can occur concurrently, forming polyribosomes (Figure 11.13). The reason
why transcription and translation can occur simultaneously is because both of these processes occur in the same 5'
414  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     to 3' direction, they both occur in the cytoplasm of the cell, and because the RNA transcript is not processed once it
     is transcribed. This allows a prokaryotic cell to respond to an environmental signal requiring new proteins very
     quickly. In contrast, in eukaryotic cells, simultaneous transcription and translation is not possible. Although
     polyribosomes also form in eukaryotes, they cannot do so until RNA synthesis is complete and the RNA molecule
     has been modified and transported out of the nucleus.

     FIGURE 11.13 In prokaryotes, multiple RNA polymerases can transcribe a single bacterial gene while numerous ribosomes concurrently
     translate the mRNA transcripts into polypeptides. In this way, a specific protein can rapidly reach a high concentration in the bacterial cell.

     Transfer RNAs
     Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are structural RNA molecules and, depending on the species, many different types of tRNAs
     exist in the cytoplasm. Bacterial species typically have between 60 and 90 types. Serving as adaptors, each tRNA
     type binds to a specific codon on the mRNA template and adds the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide
     chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually "translate" the language of RNA into the language of
     proteins. As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit so much specificity into such a
     small package. The tRNA molecule interacts with three factors: aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, ribosomes, and
     mRNA.

     Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional structure when complementary bases exposed in the single-stranded
     RNA molecule hydrogen bond with each other (Figure 11.14). This shape positions the amino-acid binding site,
     called the CCA amino acid binding end, which is a cytosine-cytosine-adenine sequence at the 3' end of the tRNA,
     and the anticodon at the other end. The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence that bonds with an mRNA codon
     through complementary base pairing.

     An amino acid is added to the end of a tRNA molecule through the process of tRNA "charging," during which each
     tRNA molecule is linked to its correct or cognate amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA
     synthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids. During this
     process, the amino acid is first activated by the addition of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and then transferred to
     the tRNA, making it a charged tRNA, and AMP is released.

The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis

Translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we will explore how translation occurs in E. coli, a
representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between bacterial and eukaryotic translation.

Initiation
The initiation of protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E. coli, this complex
involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template, three initiation factors that help the ribosome assemble
correctly, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that acts as an energy source, and a special initiator tRNA carrying
N-formyl-methionine (fMet-tRNAfMet) (Figure 11.15). The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon AUG of the
mRNA and carries a formylated methionine (fMet). Because of its involvement in initiation, fMet is inserted at the
beginning (N terminus) of every polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli. In E. coli mRNA, a leader sequence
upstream of the first AUG codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (also known as the ribosomal binding site
AGGAGG), interacts through complementary base pairing with the rRNA molecules that compose the ribosome. This
interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. At this point, the 50S
ribosomal subunit then binds to the initiation complex, forming an intact ribosome.

In eukaryotes, initiation complex formation is similar, with the following differences:

    · The initiator tRNA is a different specialized tRNA carrying methionine, called Met-tRNAi
    · Instead of binding to the mRNA at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes

        the 5' cap of the eukaryotic mRNA, then tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction until the AUG start
        codon is recognized. At this point, the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNAi, mRNA, and the 40S
        subunit.

     FIGURE 11.15 Translation in bacteria begins with the formation of the initiation complex, which includes the small ribosomal subunit, the
     mRNA, the initiator tRNA carrying N-formyl-methionine, and initiation factors. Then the 50S subunit binds, forming an intact ribosome.

     Elongation
     In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation of translation are the same. In E. coli, the binding of the
     50S ribosomal subunit to produce the intact ribosome forms three functionally important ribosomal sites: The A
     (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds charged tRNAs carrying
     amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from
     their corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that they can be recharged with free
     amino acids. There is one notable exception to this assembly line of tRNAs: During initiation complex formation,
     bacterial fMet-tRNAfMet or eukaryotic Met-tRNAi enters the P site directly without first entering the A site, providing
     a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the first codon after the AUG.

     Elongation proceeds with single-codon movements of the ribosome each called a translocation event. During each
     translocation event, the charged tRNAs enter at the A site, then shift to the P site, and then finally to the E site for
     removal. Ribosomal movements, or steps, are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by
     three bases in the 3' direction. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the A-
     site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond
     is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA-based ribozyme that is integrated into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The
     amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across
     the mRNA, the former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled. Several of the
     steps during elongation, including binding of a charged aminoacyl tRNA to the A site and translocation, require
     energy derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by specific elongation factors. Amazingly, the E. coli
     translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200 amino-acid protein can
     be translated in just 10 seconds.

     Termination
     The termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered for which there
     is no complementary tRNA. On aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in

prokaryotes and eukaryotes that result in the P-site amino acid detaching from its tRNA, releasing the newly made
polypeptide. The small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they are
recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex.

In summary, there are several key features that distinguish prokaryotic gene expression from that seen in
eukaryotes. These are illustrated in Figure 11.16 and listed in Figure 11.17.

Protein Targeting, Folding, and Modification

During and after translation, polypeptides may need to be modified before they are biologically active. Post-
translational modifications include:

  1. removal of translated signal sequences--short tails of amino acids that aid in directing a protein to a specific
        cellular compartment

  2. proper "folding" of the polypeptide and association of multiple polypeptide subunits, often facilitated by
        chaperone proteins, into a distinct three-dimensional structure

  3. proteolytic processing of an inactive polypeptide to release an active protein component, and
  4. various chemical modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, or glycosylation) of individual amino acids.

     11.5 Mutations

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Compare point mutations and frameshift mutations
         · Describe the differences between missense, nonsense, and silent mutations
         · Describe the differences between light and dark repair
         · Explain how different mutagens act
         · Explain why the Ames test can be used to detect carcinogens
         · Analyze sequences of DNA and identify examples of types of mutations

     A mutation is a heritable change in the DNA sequence of an organism. The resulting organism, called a mutant, may
     have a recognizable change in phenotype compared to the wild type, which is the phenotype most commonly
     observed in nature. A change in the DNA sequence is conferred to mRNA through transcription, and may lead to an
     altered amino acid sequence in a protein on translation. Because proteins carry out the vast majority of cellular
     functions, a change in amino acid sequence in a protein may lead to an altered phenotype for the cell and organism.

     Effects of Mutations on DNA Sequence

     There are several types of mutations that are classified according to how the DNA molecule is altered. One type,
     called a point mutation, affects a single base and most commonly occurs when one base is substituted or replaced
     by another. Mutations also result from the addition of one or more bases, known as an insertion, or the removal of
     one or more bases, known as a deletion.

         · What type of a mutation occurs when a gene has two fewer nucleotides in its sequence?

     Effects of Mutations on Protein Structure and Function

     Point mutations may have a wide range of effects on protein function (Figure 11.18). As a consequence of the
     degeneracy of the genetic code, a point mutation will commonly result in the same amino acid being incorporated
     into the resulting polypeptide despite the sequence change. This change would have no effect on the protein's
     structure, and is thus called a silent mutation. A missense mutation results in a different amino acid being
     incorporated into the resulting polypeptide. The effect of a missense mutation depends on how chemically different
     the new amino acid is from the wild-type amino acid. The location of the changed amino acid within the protein also
     is important. For example, if the changed amino acid is part of the enzyme's active site, then the effect of the
     missense mutation may be significant. Many missense mutations result in proteins that are still functional, at least
     to some degree. Sometimes the effects of missense mutations may be only apparent under certain environmental
     conditions; such missense mutations are called conditional mutations. Rarely, a missense mutation may be
     beneficial. Under the right environmental conditions, this type of mutation may give the organism that harbors it a
     selective advantage. Yet another type of point mutation, called a nonsense mutation, converts a codon encoding an
     amino acid (a sense codon) into a stop codon (a nonsense codon). Nonsense mutations result in the synthesis of
     proteins that are shorter than the wild type and typically not functional.

     Deletions and insertions also cause various effects. Because codons are triplets of nucleotides, insertions or
     deletions in groups of three nucleotides may lead to the insertion or deletion of one or more amino acids and may
     not cause significant effects on the resulting protein's functionality. However, frameshift mutations, caused by

insertions or deletions of a number of nucleotides that are not a multiple of three are extremely problematic
because a shift in the reading frame results (Figure 11.18). Because ribosomes read the mRNA in triplet codons,
frameshift mutations can change every amino acid after the point of the mutation. The new reading frame may also
include a stop codon before the end of the coding sequence. Consequently, proteins made from genes containing
frameshift mutations are nearly always nonfunctional.

     A Beneficial Mutation

     Since the first case of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was reported in 1981, nearly 40 million
     people have died from HIV infection,2 the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The virus
     targets helper T cells that play a key role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune response, infecting and killing
     cells normally involved in the body's response to infection. There is no cure for HIV infection, but many drugs have
     been developed to slow or block the progression of the virus. Although individuals around the world may be
     infected, the highest prevalence among people 15-49 years old is in sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly one person in
     20 is infected, accounting for greater than 70% of the infections worldwide3 (Figure 11.19). Unfortunately, this is
     also a part of the world where prevention strategies and drugs to treat the infection are the most lacking.

     In recent years, scientific interest has been piqued by the discovery of a few individuals from northern Europe who
     are resistant to HIV infection. In 1998, American geneticist Stephen J. O'Brien at the National Institutes of Health
     (NIH) and colleagues published the results of their genetic analysis of more than 4,000 individuals. These indicated
     that many individuals of Eurasian descent (up to 14% in some ethnic groups) have a deletion mutation, called
     CCR5-delta 32, in the gene encoding CCR5. CCR5 is a coreceptor found on the surface of T cells that is necessary for
     many strains of the virus to enter the host cell. The mutation leads to the production of a receptor to which HIV
     cannot effectively bind and thus blocks viral entry. People homozygous for this mutation have greatly reduced
     susceptibility to HIV infection, and those who are heterozygous have some protection from infection as well.

     It is not clear why people of northern European descent, specifically, carry this mutation, but its prevalence seems
     to be highest in northern Europe and steadily decreases in populations as one moves south. Research indicates that
     the mutation has been present since before HIV appeared and may have been selected for in European populations
     as a result of exposure to the plague or smallpox. This mutation may protect individuals from plague (caused by the
     bacterium Yersinia pestis) and smallpox (caused by the variola virus) because this receptor may also be involved in
     these diseases. The age of this mutation is a matter of debate, but estimates suggest it appeared between 1875
     years to 225 years ago, and may have been spread from Northern Europe through Viking invasions.

     This exciting finding has led to new avenues in HIV research, including looking for drugs to block CCR5 binding to
     HIV in individuals who lack the mutation. Although DNA testing to determine which individuals carry the CCR5-delta
     32 mutation is possible, there are documented cases of individuals homozygous for the mutation contracting HIV.
     For this reason, DNA testing for the mutation is not widely recommended by public health officials so as not to
     encourage risky behavior in those who carry the mutation. Nevertheless, inhibiting the binding of HIV to CCR5
     continues to be a valid strategy for the development of drug therapies for those infected with HIV.

          FIGURE 11.19 HIV is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but its prevalence is quite low in some other parts of the world.

Causes of Mutations

Mistakes in the process of DNA replication can cause spontaneous mutations to occur. The error rate of DNA
polymerase is one incorrect base per billion base pairs replicated. Exposure to mutagens can cause induced
mutations, which are various types of chemical agents or radiation (Table 11.4). Exposure to a mutagen can
increase the rate of mutation more than 1000-fold. Mutagens are often also carcinogens, agents that cause cancer.
However, whereas nearly all carcinogens are mutagenic, not all mutagens are necessarily carcinogens.

Chemical Mutagens
Various types of chemical mutagens interact directly with DNA either by acting as nucleoside analogs or by
modifying nucleotide bases. Chemicals called nucleoside analogs are structurally similar to normal nucleotide
bases and can be incorporated into DNA during replication (Figure 11.20). These base analogs induce mutations
because they often have different base-pairing rules than the bases they replace. Other chemical mutagens can
modify normal DNA bases, resulting in different base-pairing rules. For example, nitrous acid deaminates cytosine,
converting it to uracil. Uracil then pairs with adenine in a subsequent round of replication, resulting in the conversion
of a GC base pair to an AT base pair. Nitrous acid also deaminates adenine to hypoxanthine, which base pairs with
cytosine instead of thymine, resulting in the conversion of a TA base pair to a CG base pair.

Chemical mutagens known as intercalating agents work differently. These molecules slide between the stacked
nitrogenous bases of the DNA double helix, distorting the molecule and creating atypical spacing between
nucleotide base pairs (Figure 11.21). As a result, during DNA replication, DNA polymerase may either skip
replicating several nucleotides (creating a deletion) or insert extra nucleotides (creating an insertion). Either
outcome may lead to a frameshift mutation. Combustion products like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are
particularly dangerous intercalating agents that can lead to mutation-caused cancers. The intercalating agents
ethidium bromide and acridine orange are commonly used in the laboratory to stain DNA for visualization and are
potential mutagens.

     replication. 5BU pairs with G, converting an AT base pair to a GC base pair after several rounds of replication. (b) Nitrous acid is a different
     type of chemical mutagen that modifies already existing nucleoside bases like C to produce U, which base pairs with A. This chemical

FIGURE 11.21 Intercalating agents, such as acridine, introduce atypical spacing between base pairs, resulting in DNA polymerase
introducing either a deletion or an insertion, leading to a potential frameshift mutation.

Radiation
Exposure to either ionizing or nonionizing radiation can each induce mutations in DNA, although by different
mechanisms. Strong ionizing radiation like X-rays and gamma rays can cause single- and double-stranded breaks
in the DNA backbone through the formation of hydroxyl radicals on radiation exposure (Figure 11.22). Ionizing
radiation can also modify bases; for example, the deamination of cytosine to uracil, analogous to the action of
nitrous acid.4 Ionizing radiation exposure is used to kill microbes to sterilize medical devices and foods, because of
its dramatic nonspecific effect in damaging DNA, proteins, and other cellular components (see Using Physical
Methods to Control Microorganisms).
Nonionizing radiation, like ultraviolet light, is not energetic enough to initiate these types of chemical changes.
However, nonionizing radiation can induce dimer formation between two adjacent pyrimidine bases, commonly
two thymines, within a nucleotide strand. During thymine dimer formation, the two adjacent thymines become
covalently linked and, if left unrepaired, both DNA replication and transcription are stalled at this point. DNA
polymerase may proceed and replicate the dimer incorrectly, potentially leading to frameshift or point mutations.

FIGURE 11.22 (a) Ionizing radiation may lead to the formation of single-stranded and double-stranded breaks in the sugar-phosphate
backbone of DNA, as well as to the modification of bases (not shown). (b) Nonionizing radiation like ultraviolet light can lead to the
formation of thymine dimers, which can stall replication and transcription and introduce frameshift or point mutations.

     DNA Repair

     The process of DNA replication is highly accurate, but mistakes can occur spontaneously or be induced by
     mutagens. Uncorrected mistakes can lead to serious consequences for the phenotype. Cells have developed several
     repair mechanisms to minimize the number of mutations that persist.

     Proofreading
     Most of the mistakes introduced during DNA replication are promptly corrected by most DNA polymerases through a

11.5 · Mutations                                                                                                       425

function called proofreading. In proofreading, the DNA polymerase reads the newly added base, ensuring that it is
complementary to the corresponding base in the template strand before adding the next one. If an incorrect base
has been added, the enzyme makes a cut to release the wrong nucleotide and a new base is added.

Mismatch Repair
Some errors introduced during replication are corrected shortly after the replication machinery has moved. This
mechanism is called mismatch repair. The enzymes involved in this mechanism recognize the incorrectly added
nucleotide, excise it, and replace it with the correct base. One example is the methyl-directed mismatch repair in E.
coli. The DNA is hemimethylated. This means that the parental strand is methylated while the newly synthesized
daughter strand is not. It takes several minutes before the new strand is methylated. Proteins MutS, MutL, and MutH
bind to the hemimethylated site where the incorrect nucleotide is found. MutH cuts the nonmethylated strand (the
new strand). An exonuclease removes a portion of the strand (including the incorrect nucleotide). The gap formed is
then filled in by DNA pol III and ligase.

Repair of Thymine Dimers
Because the production of thymine dimers is common (many organisms cannot avoid ultraviolet light), mechanisms
have evolved to repair these lesions. In nucleotide excision repair (also called dark repair), enzymes remove the
pyrimidine dimer and replace it with the correct nucleotides (Figure 11.23). In E. coli, the DNA is scanned by an
enzyme complex. If a distortion in the double helix is found that was introduced by the pyrimidine dimer, the
enzyme complex cuts the sugar-phosphate backbone several bases upstream and downstream of the dimer, and
the segment of DNA between these two cuts is then enzymatically removed. DNA pol I replaces the missing
nucleotides with the correct ones and DNA ligase seals the gap in the sugar-phosphate backbone.

The direct repair (also called light repair) of thymine dimers occurs through the process of photoreactivation in the
presence of visible light. An enzyme called photolyase recognizes the distortion in the DNA helix caused by the
thymine dimer and binds to the dimer. Then, in the presence of visible light, the photolyase enzyme changes
conformation and breaks apart the thymine dimer, allowing the thymines to again correctly base pair with the
adenines on the complementary strand. Photoreactivation appears to be present in all organisms, with the
exception of placental mammals, including humans. Photoreactivation is particularly important for organisms
chronically exposed to ultraviolet radiation, like plants, photosynthetic bacteria, algae, and corals, to prevent the
accumulation of mutations caused by thymine dimer formation.

Identifying Bacterial Mutants

One common technique used to identify bacterial mutants is called replica plating. This technique is used to detect
nutritional mutants, called auxotrophs, which have a mutation in a gene encoding an enzyme in the biosynthesis
pathway of a specific nutrient, such as an amino acid. As a result, whereas wild-type cells retain the ability to grow
normally on a medium lacking the specific nutrient, auxotrophs are unable to grow on such a medium. During replica
plating (Figure 11.24), a population of bacterial cells is mutagenized and then plated as individual cells on a
complex nutritionally complete plate and allowed to grow into colonies. Cells from these colonies are removed from
this master plate, often using sterile velvet. This velvet, containing cells, is then pressed in the same orientation onto
plates of various media. At least one plate should also be nutritionally complete to ensure that cells are being
properly transferred between the plates. The other plates lack specific nutrients, allowing the researcher to discover
various auxotrophic mutants unable to produce specific nutrients. Cells from the corresponding colony on the
nutritionally complete plate can be used to recover the mutant for further study.

The Ames Test

The Ames test, developed by Bruce Ames (1928-) in the 1970s, is a method that uses bacteria for rapid,
inexpensive screening of the carcinogenic potential of new chemical compounds. The test measures the mutation
rate associated with exposure to the compound, which, if elevated, may indicate that exposure to this compound is
associated with greater cancer risk. The Ames test uses as the test organism a strain of Salmonella typhimurium
that is a histidine auxotroph, unable to synthesize its own histidine because of a mutation in an essential gene
required for its synthesis. After exposure to a potential mutagen, these bacteria are plated onto a medium lacking
histidine, and the number of mutants regaining the ability to synthesize histidine is recorded and compared with the
number of such mutants that arise in the absence of the potential mutagen (Figure 11.25). Chemicals that are more
mutagenic will bring about more mutants with restored histidine synthesis in the Ames test. Because many
chemicals are not directly mutagenic but are metabolized to mutagenic forms by liver enzymes, rat liver extract is
commonly included at the start of this experiment to mimic liver metabolism. After the Ames test is conducted,
compounds identified as mutagenic are further tested for their potential carcinogenic properties by using other
models, including animal models like mice and rats.

     11.6 How Asexual Prokaryotes Achieve Genetic Diversity

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Compare the processes of transformation, transduction, and conjugation
         · Explain how asexual gene transfer results in prokaryotic genetic diversity
         · Explain the structure and consequences for bacterial genetic diversity of transposons

     Typically, when we consider genetic transfer, we think of vertical gene transfer, the transmission of genetic
     information from generation to generation. Vertical gene transfer is by far the main mode of transmission of genetic
     information in all cells. In sexually reproducing organisms, crossing-over events and independent assortment of
     individual chromosomes during meiosis contribute to genetic diversity in the population. Genetic diversity is also
     introduced during sexual reproduction, when the genetic information from two parents, each with different
     complements of genetic information, are combined, producing new combinations of parental genotypes in the
     diploid offspring. The occurrence of mutations also contributes to genetic diversity in a population. Genetic diversity
     of offspring is useful in changing or inconsistent environments and may be one reason for the evolutionary success
     of sexual reproduction.

     When prokaryotes and eukaryotes reproduce asexually, they transfer a nearly identical copy of their genetic material
     to their offspring through vertical gene transfer. Although asexual reproduction produces more offspring more
     quickly, any benefits of diversity among those offspring are lost. How then do organisms whose dominant
     reproductive mode is asexual create genetic diversity? In prokaryotes, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the
     introduction of genetic material from one organism to another organism within the same generation, is an important
     way to introduce genetic diversity. HGT allows even distantly related species to share genes, influencing their
     phenotypes. It is thought that HGT is more prevalent in prokaryotes but that only a small fraction of the prokaryotic
     genome may be transferred by this type of transfer at any one time. As the phenomenon is investigated more
     thoroughly, it may be revealed to be even more common. Many scientists believe that HGT and mutation are
     significant sources of genetic variation, the raw material for the process of natural selection, in prokaryotes.

Although HGT is more common among evolutionarily related organisms, it may occur between any two species that
live together in a natural community.

HGT in prokaryotes is known to occur by the three primary mechanisms that are illustrated in Figure 11.26:

  1. Transformation: naked DNA is taken up from the environment
  2. Transduction: genes are transferred between cells in a virus (see The Viral Life Cycle)
  3. Conjugation: use of a hollow tube called a conjugation pilus to transfer genes between cells

FIGURE 11.26 There are three prokaryote-specific mechanisms leading to horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes. a) In transformation, the
cell takes up DNA directly from the environment. The DNA may remain separate as a plasmid or be incorporated into the host genome. b) In
transduction, a bacteriophage injects DNA that is a hybrid of viral DNA and DNA from a previously infected bacterial cell. c) In conjugation,
DNA is transferred between cells through a cytoplasmic bridge after a conjugation pilus draws the two cells close enough to form the
bridge.

Transformation

Frederick Griffith was the first to demonstrate the process of transformation. In 1928, he showed that live,
nonpathogenic Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria could be transformed into pathogenic bacteria through
exposure to a heat-killed pathogenic strain. He concluded that some sort of agent, which he called the
"transforming principle," had been passed from the dead pathogenic bacteria to the live, nonpathogenic bacteria. In
1944, Oswald Avery (1877-1955), Colin MacLeod (1909-1972), and Maclyn McCarty (1911-2005) demonstrated
that the transforming principle was DNA (see Using Microorganisms to Discover the Secrets of Life).

In transformation, the prokaryote takes up naked DNA found in its environment and that is derived from other cells
that have lysed on death and released their contents, including their genome, into the environment. Many bacteria
are naturally competent, meaning that they actively bind to environmental DNA, transport it across their cell
envelopes into their cytoplasm, and make it single stranded. Typically, double-stranded foreign DNA within cells is
destroyed by nucleases as a defense against viral infection. However, these nucleases are usually ineffective against
single-stranded DNA, so this single-stranded DNA within the cell has the opportunity to recombine into the bacterial
genome. A molecule of DNA that contains fragments of DNA from different organisms is called recombinant DNA.
(Recombinant DNA will be discussed in more detail in Microbes and the Tools of Genetic Engineering.) If the
bacterium incorporates the new DNA into its own genome through recombination, the bacterial cell may gain new
phenotypic properties. For example, if a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up DNA for a toxin gene from a pathogen
and then incorporates it into its chromosome, it, too, may become pathogenic. Plasmid DNA may also be taken up
by competent bacteria and confer new properties to the cell. Overall, transformation in nature is a relatively
430  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     inefficient process because environmental DNA levels are low because of the activity of nucleases that are also
     released during cellular lysis. Additionally, genetic recombination is inefficient at incorporating new DNA sequences
     into the genome.

     In nature, bacterial transformation is an important mechanism for the acquisition of genetic elements encoding
     virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. Genes encoding resistance to antimicrobial compounds have been
     shown to be widespread in nature, even in environments not influenced by humans. These genes, which allow
     microbes living in mixed communities to compete for limited resources, can be transferred within a population by
     transformation, as well as by the other processes of HGT. In the laboratory, we can exploit the natural process of
     bacterial transformation for genetic engineering to make a wide variety of medicinal products, as discussed in
     Microbes and the Tools of Genetic Engineering.

         · Why does a bacterial cell make environmental DNA brought into the cell into a single-stranded form?

     Transduction

     Viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages) may also move short pieces of chromosomal DNA from one bacterium
     to another in a process called transduction (see Figure 6.9). Recall that in generalized transduction, any piece of
     chromosomal DNA may be transferred to a new host cell by accidental packaging of chromosomal DNA into a phage
     head during phage assembly. By contrast, specialized transduction results from the imprecise excision of a lysogenic
     prophage from the bacterial chromosome such that it carries with it a piece of the bacterial chromosome from either
     side of the phage's integration site to a new host cell. As a result, the host may acquire new properties. This process
     is called lysogenic conversion. Of medical significance, a lysogenic phage may carry with it a virulence gene to its
     new host. Once inserted into the new host's chromosome, the new host may gain pathogenicity. Several pathogenic
     bacteria, including Corynebacterium diphtheriae (the causative agent of diphtheria) and Clostridium botulinum (the
     causative agent of botulism), are virulent because of the introduction of toxin-encoding genes by lysogenic
     bacteriophages, affirming the clinical relevance of transduction in the exchange of genes involved in infectious
     disease. Archaea have their own viruses that translocate genetic material from one individual to another.

     CASE IN POINT

     The Clinical Consequences of Transduction

     Paul, a 23-year-old relief worker from Atlanta, traveled to Haiti in 2011 to provide aid following the 2010
     earthquake. After working there for several weeks, he suddenly began experiencing abdominal distress,
     including severe cramping, nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. He also began to experience intense muscle
     cramping. At a local clinic, the physician suspected that Paul's symptoms were caused by cholera because there
     had been a cholera outbreak after the earthquake. Because cholera is transmitted by the fecal-oral route,
     breaches in sanitation infrastructure, such as often occur following natural disasters, may precipitate outbreaks.
     The physician confirmed the presumptive diagnosis using a cholera dipstick test. He then prescribed Paul a
     single dose of doxycycline, as well as oral rehydration salts, instructing him to drink significant amounts of clean
     water.

     Cholera is caused by the gram-negative curved rod Vibrio cholerae (Figure 11.27). Its symptoms largely result
     from the production of the cholera toxin (CT), which ultimately activates a chloride transporter to pump chloride
     ions out of the epithelial cells into the gut lumen. Water then follows the chloride ions, causing the prolific
     watery diarrhea characteristic of cholera. The gene encoding the cholera toxin is incorporated into the bacterial

chromosome of V. cholerae through infection of the bacterium with the lysogenic filamentous CTX phage, which
carries the CT gene and introduces it into the chromosome on integration of the prophage. Thus, pathogenic

Conjugation

In conjugation, DNA is directly transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a conjugation pilus, which
brings the organisms into contact with one another. In E. coli, the genes encoding the ability to conjugate are located
on a bacterial plasmid called the F plasmid, also known as the fertility factor, and the conjugation pilus is called
the F pilus. The F-plasmid genes encode both the proteins composing the F pilus and those involved in rolling circle
replication of the plasmid. Cells containing the F plasmid, capable of forming an F pilus, are called F+ cells or donor
cells, and those lacking an F plasmid are called F- cells or recipient cells.

Conjugation of the F Plasmid
During typical conjugation in E. coli, the F pilus of an F+ cell comes into contact with an F- cell and retracts, bringing
the two cell envelopes into contact (Figure 11.28). Then a cytoplasmic bridge forms between the two cells at the
site of the conjugation pilus. As rolling circle replication of the F plasmid occurs in the F+ cell, a single-stranded copy
of the F plasmid is transferred through the cytoplasmic bridge to the F- cell, which then synthesizes the
complementary strand, making it double stranded. The F- cell now becomes an F+ cell capable of making its own
conjugation pilus. Eventually, in a mixed bacterial population containing both F+ and F- cells, all cells will become F+
cells. Genes on the E. coli F plasmid also encode proteins preventing conjugation between F+ cells.
432  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     FIGURE 11.28 Typical conjugation of the F plasmid from an F+ cell to an F- cell is brought about by the conjugation pilus bringing the two
     cells into contact. A single strand of the F plasmid is transferred to the F- cell, which is then made double stranded.

     Conjugation of F' and Hfr Cells
     Although typical conjugation in E. coli results in the transfer of the F-plasmid DNA only, conjugation may also
     transfer chromosomal DNA. This is because the F plasmid occasionally integrates into the bacterial chromosome
     through recombination between the plasmid and the chromosome, forming an Hfr cell (Figure 11.29). "Hfr" refers
     to the high frequency of recombination seen when recipient F- cells receive genetic information from Hfr cells
     through conjugation. Similar to the imprecise excision of a prophage during specialized transduction, the integrated
     F plasmid may also be imprecisely excised from the chromosome, producing an F' plasmid that carries with it some
     chromosomal DNA adjacent to the integration site. On conjugation, this DNA is introduced to the recipient cell and
     may be either maintained as part of the F' plasmid or be recombined into the recipient cell's bacterial chromosome.
     Hfr cells may also treat the bacterial chromosome like an enormous F plasmid and attempt to transfer a copy of it to
     a recipient F- cell. Because the bacterial chromosome is so large, transfer of the entire chromosome takes a long
     time (Figure 11.30). However, contact between bacterial cells during conjugation is transient, so it is unusual for the
     entire chromosome to be transferred. Host chromosomal DNA near the integration site of the F plasmid, displaced
     by the unidirectional process of rolling circle replication, is more likely to be transferred and recombined into a
     recipient cell's chromosome than host genes farther away. Thus, the relative location of bacterial genes on the Hfr
     cell's genome can be mapped based on when they are transferred through conjugation. As a result, prior to the age
     of widespread bacterial genome sequencing, distances on prokaryotic genome maps were often measured in
     minutes.

FIGURE 11.29 (a) The F plasmid can occasionally integrate into the bacterial chromosome, producing an Hfr cell. (b) Imprecise excision of
the F plasmid from the chromosome of an Hfr cell may lead to the production of an F' plasmid that carries chromosomal DNA adjacent to
the integration site. This F' plasmid can be transferred to an F- cell by conjugation.

FIGURE 11.30 (a) An Hfr cell may attempt to transfer the entire bacterial chromosome to an F- cell, treating the chromosome like an
extremely large F plasmid. However, contact between cells during conjugation is temporary. Chromosomal genes closest to the integration
site (gene 1) that are first displaced during rolling circle replication will be transferred more quickly than genes far away from the
integration site (gene 4). Hence, they are more likely to be recombined into the recipient F- cell's chromosome. (b) The time it takes for a
gene to be transferred, as detected by recombination into the F- cell's chromosome, can be used to generate a map of the bacterial
genome, such as this genomic map of E. coli. Note that it takes approximately 100 minutes for the entire genome (4.6 Mbp) of an Hfr strain
of E. coli to be transferred by conjugation.

Consequences and Applications of Conjugation
Plasmids are an important type of extrachromosomal DNA element in bacteria and, in those cells that harbor them,
are considered to be part of the bacterial genome. From a clinical perspective, plasmids often code for genes
involved in virulence. For example, genes encoding proteins that make a bacterial cell resistant to a particular
antibiotic are encoded on R plasmids. R plasmids, in addition to their genes for antimicrobial resistance, contain
genes that control conjugation and transfer of the plasmid. R plasmids are able to transfer between cells of the
same species and between cells of different species. Single R plasmids commonly contain multiple genes conferring
resistance to multiple antibiotics.

Genes required for the production of various toxins and molecules important for colonization during infection may
also be found encoded on plasmids. For example, verotoxin-producing strains of E. coli (VTEC) appear to have
acquired the genes encoding the Shiga toxin from its gram-negative relative Shigella dysenteriae through the
acquisition of a large plasmid encoding this toxin. VTEC causes severe diarrheal disease that may result in hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), which may be lead to kidney failure and death.

In nonclinical settings, bacterial genes that encode metabolic enzymes needed to degrade specialized atypical
compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also frequently encoded on plasmids. Additionally,
certain plasmids have the ability to move from bacterial cells to other cell types, like those of plants and animals,
through mechanisms distinct from conjugation. Such mechanisms and their use in genetic engineering are covered

     Transposition

     Genetic elements called transposons (transposable elements), or "jumping genes," are molecules of DNA that
     include special inverted repeat sequences at their ends and a gene encoding the enzyme transposase (Figure
     11.31). Transposons allow the entire sequence to independently excise from one location in a DNA molecule and
     integrate into the DNA elsewhere through a process called transposition. Transposons were originally discovered in
     maize (corn) by American geneticist Barbara McClintock (1902-1992) in the 1940s. Transposons have since been
     found in all types of organisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Thus, unlike the three previous mechanisms
     discussed, transposition is not prokaryote-specific. Most transposons are nonreplicative, meaning they move in a
     "cut-and-paste" fashion. Some may be replicative, however, retaining their location in the DNA while making a copy
     to be inserted elsewhere ("copy and paste"). Because transposons can move within a DNA molecule, from one DNA
     molecule to another, or even from one cell to another, they have the ability to introduce genetic diversity. Movement
     within the same DNA molecule can alter phenotype by inactivating or activating a gene.

     Transposons may carry with them additional genes, moving these genes from one location to another with them. For
     example, bacterial transposons can relocate antibiotic resistance genes, moving them from chromosomes to
     plasmids. This mechanism has been shown to be responsible for the colocalization of multiple antibiotic resistance
     genes on a single R plasmid in Shigella strains causing bacterial dysentery. Such an R plasmid can then be easily
     transferred among a bacterial population through the process of conjugation.

     FIGURE 11.31 Transposons are segments of DNA that have the ability to move from one location to another because they code for the
     enzyme transposase. In this example, a nonreplicative transposon has disrupted gene B. The consequence of that the transcription of gene
     B may now have been interrupted.

continued to expand, and he had to be put on a ventilator to help him breathe. Mark's physician ordered surgical
removal of the infected tissue. Following an initial surgery, Mark's wound was monitored daily to ensure that the
infection did not return, but it continued to spread.

After two additional rounds of surgery, the infection finally seemed to be contained. A few days later, Mark was

11.7 Gene Regulation: Operon Theory

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Compare inducible operons and repressible operons
    · Describe why regulation of operons is important

Each nucleated cell in a multicellular organism contains copies of the same DNA. Similarly, all cells in two pure
bacterial cultures inoculated from the same starting colony contain the same DNA, with the exception of changes
that arise from spontaneous mutations. If each cell in a multicellular organism has the same DNA, then how is it that
cells in different parts of the organism's body exhibit different characteristics? Similarly, how is it that the same
bacterial cells within two pure cultures exposed to different environmental conditions can exhibit different
phenotypes? In both cases, each genetically identical cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Only
a subset of proteins in a cell at a given time is expressed.

Genomic DNA contains both structural genes, which encode products that serve as cellular structures or enzymes,
and regulatory genes, which encode products that regulate gene expression. The expression of a gene is a highly
regulated process. Whereas regulating gene expression in multicellular organisms allows for cellular differentiation,
in single-celled organisms like prokaryotes, it primarily ensures that a cell's resources are not wasted making
proteins that the cell does not need at that time.

Elucidating the mechanisms controlling gene expression is important to the understanding of human health.
436  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     Malfunctions in this process in humans lead to the development of cancer and other diseases. Understanding the
     interaction between the gene expression of a pathogen and that of its human host is important for the
     understanding of a particular infectious disease. Gene regulation involves a complex web of interactions within a
     given cell among signals from the cell's environment, signaling molecules within the cell, and the cell's DNA. These
     interactions lead to the expression of some genes and the suppression of others, depending on circumstances.

     Prokaryotes and eukaryotes share some similarities in their mechanisms to regulate gene expression; however,
     gene expression in eukaryotes is more complicated because of the temporal and spatial separation between the
     processes of transcription and translation. Thus, although most regulation of gene expression occurs through
     transcriptional control in prokaryotes, regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes occurs at the transcriptional level
     and post-transcriptionally (after the primary transcript has been made).

     Prokaryotic Gene Regulation

     In bacteria and archaea, structural proteins with related functions are usually encoded together within the genome
     in a block called an operon and are transcribed together under the control of a single promoter, resulting in the
     formation of a polycistronic transcript (Figure 11.32). In this way, regulation of the transcription of all of the
     structural genes encoding the enzymes that catalyze the many steps in a single biochemical pathway can be
     controlled simultaneously, because they will either all be needed at the same time, or none will be needed. For
     example, in E. coli, all of the structural genes that encode enzymes needed to use lactose as an energy source lie
     next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon under the control of a single promoter, the lac promoter. French
     scientists François Jacob (1920-2013) and Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute were the first to show the
     organization of bacterial genes into operons, through their studies on the lac operon of E. coli. For this work, they
     won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1965. Although eukaryotic genes are not organized into operons,
     prokaryotic operons are excellent models for learning about gene regulation generally. There are some gene clusters
     in eukaryotes that function similar to operons. Many of the principles can be applied to eukaryotic systems and
     contribute to our understanding of changes in gene expression in eukaryotes that can result pathological changes
     such as cancer.

     Each operon includes DNA sequences that influence its own transcription; these are located in a region called the
     regulatory region. The regulatory region includes the promoter and the region surrounding the promoter, to which
     transcription factors, proteins encoded by regulatory genes, can bind. Transcription factors influence the binding of
     RNA polymerase to the promoter and allow its progression to transcribe structural genes. A repressor is a
     transcription factor that suppresses transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus by binding to a DNA
     sequence within the regulatory region called the operator, which is located between the RNA polymerase binding
     site of the promoter and the transcriptional start site of the first structural gene. Repressor binding physically blocks
     RNA polymerase from transcribing structural genes. Conversely, an activator is a transcription factor that increases
     the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus by facilitating RNA polymerase binding to the
     promoter. An inducer, a third type of regulatory molecule, is a small molecule that either activates or represses
     transcription by interacting with a repressor or an activator.

     In prokaryotes, there are examples of operons whose gene products are required rather consistently and whose
     expression, therefore, is unregulated. Such operons are constitutively expressed, meaning they are transcribed
     and translated continuously to provide the cell with constant intermediate levels of the protein products. Such
     genes encode enzymes involved in housekeeping functions required for cellular maintenance, including DNA
     replication, repair, and expression, as well as enzymes involved in core metabolism. In contrast, there are other
     prokaryotic operons that are expressed only when needed and are regulated by repressors, activators, and inducers.

FIGURE 11.32 In prokaryotes, structural genes of related function are often organized together on the genome and transcribed together
under the control of a single promoter. The operon's regulatory region includes both the promoter and the operator. If a repressor binds to
the operator, then the structural genes will not be transcribed. Alternatively, activators may bind to the regulatory region, enhancing
transcription.

Regulation by Repression

Prokaryotic operons are commonly controlled by the binding of repressors to operator regions, thereby preventing
the transcription of the structural genes. Such operons are classified as either repressible operons or inducible
operons. Repressible operons, like the tryptophan (trp) operon, typically contain genes encoding enzymes required
for a biosynthetic pathway. As long as the product of the pathway, like tryptophan, continues to be required by the
cell, a repressible operon will continue to be expressed. However, when the product of the biosynthetic pathway
begins to accumulate in the cell, removing the need for the cell to continue to make more, the expression of the
operon is repressed. Conversely, inducible operons, like the lac operon of E. coli, often contain genes encoding
enzymes in a pathway involved in the metabolism of a specific substrate like lactose. These enzymes are only
required when that substrate is available, thus expression of the operons is typically induced only in the presence of
the substrate.

The trp Operon: A Repressible Operon
E. coli can synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five structural genes located next to each other
in the trp operon (Figure 11.33). When environmental tryptophan is low, the operon is turned on. This means that
transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized. However, if tryptophan is present
in the environment, the trp operon is turned off. Transcription does not occur and tryptophan is not synthesized.

When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the
operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized. However, when tryptophan accumulates in the cell, two tryptophan
molecules bind to the trp repressor molecule, which changes its shape, allowing it to bind to the trp operator. This
binding of the active form of the trp repressor to the operator blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the
structural genes, stopping expression of the operon. Thus, the actual product of the biosynthetic pathway controlled
by the operon regulates the expression of the operon.

     tryptophan is absent, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator, and the genes are transcribed. When tryptophan is plentiful,
     tryptophan binds the repressor protein at the operator sequence. This physically blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the
     tryptophan biosynthesis genes.

     The lac Operon: An Inducible Operon
     The lac operon is an example of an inducible operon that is also subject to activation in the absence of glucose
     (Figure 11.34). The lac operon encodes three structural genes necessary to acquire and process the disaccharide
     lactose from the environment, breaking it down into the simple sugars glucose and galactose. For the lac operon to
     be expressed, lactose must be present. This makes sense for the cell because it would be energetically wasteful to
     create the enzymes to process lactose if lactose was not available.
     In the absence of lactose, the lac repressor is bound to the operator region of the lac operon, physically preventing
     RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. However, when lactose is present, the lactose inside the
     cell is converted to allolactose. Allolactose serves as an inducer molecule, binding to the repressor and changing its
     shape so that it is no longer able to bind to the operator DNA. Removal of the repressor in the presence of lactose
     allows RNA polymerase to move through the operator region and begin transcription of the lac structural genes.

When lactose is absent, the repressor protein binds to the operator, physically blocking the RNA polymerase from transcribing the lac
structural genes. When lactose is available, a lactose molecule binds the repressor protein, preventing the repressor from binding to the
operator sequence, and the genes are transcribed.

The lac Operon: Activation by Catabolite Activator Protein
Bacteria typically have the ability to use a variety of substrates as carbon sources. However, because glucose is
usually preferable to other substrates, bacteria have mechanisms to ensure that alternative substrates are only
used when glucose has been depleted. Additionally, bacteria have mechanisms to ensure that the genes encoding
enzymes for using alternative substrates are expressed only when the alternative substrate is available. In the
1940s, Jacques Monod was the first to demonstrate the preference for certain substrates over others through his
studies of E. coli's growth when cultured in the presence of two different substrates simultaneously. Such studies
generated diauxic growth curves, like the one shown in Figure 11.35. Although the preferred substrate glucose is
used first, E. coli grows quickly and the enzymes for lactose metabolism are absent. However, once glucose levels
are depleted, growth rates slow, inducing the expression of the enzymes needed for the metabolism of the second
substrate, lactose. Notice how the growth rate in lactose is slower, as indicated by the lower steepness of the growth
curve.

The ability to switch from glucose use to another substrate like lactose is a consequence of the activity of an enzyme
called Enzyme IIA (EIIA). When glucose levels drop, cells produce less ATP from catabolism (see Catabolism of
Carbohydrates), and EIIA becomes phosphorylated. Phosphorylated EIIA activates adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme
that converts some of the remaining ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a cyclic derivative of AMP and important signaling
molecule involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E. coli. As a result, cAMP levels begin to rise in the cell
(Figure 11.36).

The lac operon also plays a role in this switch from using glucose to using lactose. When glucose is scarce, the
accumulating cAMP caused by increased adenylyl cyclase activity binds to catabolite activator protein (CAP), also
known as cAMP receptor protein (CRP). The complex binds to the promoter region of the lac operon (Figure 11.37).
In the regulatory regions of these operons, a CAP binding site is located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding
site in the promoter. Binding of the CAP-cAMP complex to this site increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase
to the promoter region to initiate the transcription of the structural genes. Thus, in the case of the lac operon, for
transcription to occur, lactose must be present (removing the lac repressor protein) and glucose levels must be
depleted (allowing binding of an activating protein). When glucose levels are high, there is catabolite repression of
operons encoding enzymes for the metabolism of alternative substrates. Because of low cAMP levels under these
conditions, there is an insufficient amount of the CAP-cAMP complex to activate transcription of these operons. See
Table 11.6 for a summary of the regulation of the lac operon.

FIGURE 11.35 When grown in the presence of two substrates, E. coli uses the preferred substrate (in this case glucose) until it is depleted.
440  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     Then, enzymes needed for the metabolism of the second substrate are expressed and growth resumes, although at a slower rate.

     FIGURE 11.36 When ATP levels decrease due to depletion of glucose, some remaining ATP is converted to cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus,
     increased cAMP levels signal glucose depletion.

     FIGURE 11.37 (a) In the presence of cAMP, CAP binds to the promoters of operons, like the lac operon, that encode genes for enzymes for
     the use of alternate substrates. (b) For the lac operon to be expressed, there must be activation by cAMP-CAP as well as removal of the lac
     repressor from the operator.

Global Responses of Prokaryotes

In prokaryotes, there are also several higher levels of gene regulation that have the ability to control the
transcription of many related operons simultaneously in response to an environmental signal. A group of operons all
controlled simultaneously is called a regulon.

Alarmones
When sensing impending stress, prokaryotes alter the expression of a wide variety of operons to respond in
coordination. They do this through the production of alarmones, which are small intracellular nucleotide derivatives.
Alarmones change which genes are expressed and stimulate the expression of specific stress-response genes. The
use of alarmones to alter gene expression in response to stress appears to be important in pathogenic bacteria. On
encountering host defense mechanisms and other harsh conditions during infection, many operons encoding
virulence genes are upregulated in response to alarmone signaling. Knowledge of these responses is key to being
able to fully understand the infection process of many pathogens and to the development of therapies to counter
this process.
Alternate  Factors
Since the  subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase confers specificity as to which promoters should be transcribed,
altering the  factor used is another way for bacteria to quickly and globally change what regulons are transcribed at
a given time. The  factor recognizes sequences within a bacterial promoter, so different  factors will each
recognize slightly different promoter sequences. In this way, when the cell senses specific environmental
conditions, it may respond by changing which  factor it expresses, degrading the old one and producing a new one
to transcribe the operons encoding genes whose products will be useful under the new environmental condition. For
example, in sporulating bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium (which include many pathogens), a group of
 factors controls the expression of the many genes needed for sporulation in response to sporulation-stimulating
signals.

Additional Methods of Regulation in Bacteria: Attenuation and Riboswitches

Although most gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription initiation in prokaryotes, there are also
mechanisms to control both the completion of transcription as well as translation concurrently. Since their
discovery, these mechanisms have been shown to control the completion of transcription and translation of many
prokaryotic operons. Because these mechanisms link the regulation of transcription and translation directly, they
are specific to prokaryotes, because these processes are physically separated in eukaryotes.

One such regulatory system is attenuation, whereby secondary stem-loop structures formed within the 5' end of an
mRNA being transcribed determine if transcription to complete the synthesis of this mRNA will occur and if this
mRNA will be used for translation. Beyond the transcriptional repression mechanism already discussed, attenuation
also controls expression of the trp operon in E. coli (Figure 11.38). The trp operon regulatory region contains a
442  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     leader sequence called trpL between the operator and the first structural gene, which has four stretches of RNA that
     can base pair with each other in different combinations. When a terminator stem-loop forms, transcription
     terminates, releasing RNA polymerase from the mRNA. However, when an antiterminator stem-loop forms, this
     prevents the formation of the terminator stem-loop, so RNA polymerase can transcribe the structural genes.

     A related mechanism of concurrent regulation of transcription and translation in prokaryotes is the use of a
     riboswitch, a small region of noncoding RNA found within the 5' end of some prokaryotic mRNA molecules (Figure
     11.39. A riboswitch may bind to a small intracellular molecule to stabilize certain secondary structures of the mRNA
     molecule. The binding of the small molecule determines which stem-loop structure forms, thus influencing the
     completion of mRNA synthesis and protein synthesis.

     FIGURE 11.38 When tryptophan is plentiful, translation of the short leader peptide encoded by trpL proceeds, the terminator loop between
     regions 3 and 4 forms, and transcription terminates. When tryptophan levels are depleted, translation of the short leader peptide stalls at
     region 1, allowing regions 2 and 3 to form an antiterminator loop, and RNA polymerase can transcribe the structural genes of the trp
     operon.

(right).

Other Factors Affecting Gene Expression in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes

Although the focus on our discussion of transcriptional control used prokaryotic operons as examples, eukaryotic
transcriptional control is similar in many ways. As in prokaryotes, eukaryotic transcription can be controlled through
the binding of transcription factors including repressors and activators. Interestingly, eukaryotic transcription can be
influenced by the binding of proteins to regions of DNA, called enhancers, rather far away from the gene, through
DNA looping facilitated between the enhancer and the promoter (Figure 11.40). Overall, regulating transcription is a
highly effective way to control gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the control of gene
expression in eukaryotes in response to environmental and cellular stresses can be accomplished in additional ways
without the binding of transcription factors to regulatory regions.

FIGURE 11.40 In eukaryotes, an enhancer is a DNA sequence that promotes transcription. Each enhancer is made up of short DNA
sequences called distal control elements. Activators bound to the distal control elements interact with mediator proteins and transcription
factors. Two different genes may have the same promoter but different distal control elements, enabling differential gene expression.

DNA-Level Control
In eukaryotes, the DNA molecules or associated histones can be chemically modified in such a way as to influence
transcription; this is called epigenetic regulation. Methylation of certain cytosine nucleotides in DNA in response to
444  11 · Mechanisms of Microbial Genetics

     environmental factors has been shown to influence use of such DNA for transcription, with DNA methylation
     commonly correlating to lowered levels of gene expression. Additionally, in response to environmental factors,
     histone proteins for packaging DNA can also be chemically modified in multiple ways, including acetylation and
     deacetylation, influencing the packaging state of DNA and thus affecting the availability of loosely wound DNA for
     transcription. These chemical modifications can sometimes be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division,
     making at least some of these epigenetic changes heritable.

     Although Mark survived his bout with necrotizing fasciitis, he would now have to undergo a skin-grafting surgery,
     followed by long-term physical therapy. Based on the amount of muscle mass he lost, it is unlikely that his leg
     will return to full strength, but his physical therapist is optimistic that he will regain some use of his leg.

     Laboratory testing revealed the causative agent of Mark's infection was a strain of Staphylococcus aureus. As
     required by law, Mark's case was reported to the state health department and ultimately to the Centers for
     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the CDC, the strain of Staphylococcus aureus strep isolated from Mark
     was analyzed more thoroughly for methicillin resistance.

     Methicillin resistance is genetically coded and is increasing among strains of S. aureus through horizontal gene
     transfer. Strains of S. aureus that are resistant to methicillin are typically resistant to virtually all beta-lactam
     antibiotics and other classes of antibiotics as well. In necrotizing fasciitis, blood flow to the infected area is
     typically limited because of the action of various genetically encoded bacterial toxins. This is why there is
     typically little to no bleeding as a result of the incision test. Unfortunately, these bacterial toxins limit the
     effectiveness of intravenous antibiotics in clearing infection from the skin and underlying tissue, meaning that
     antibiotic resistance alone does not explain the ineffectiveness of Mark's treatment. Nevertheless, intravenous
     antibiotic therapy was warranted to help minimize the possible outcome of sepsis, which is a common outcome
     of necrotizing fasciitis. Through genomic analysis by the CDC of the strain isolated from Mark, several of the
     important virulence genes were shown to be encoded within pathogenicity islands that were associated with
     prophages. Horizontal transfer of pathogenicity island-encoded virulence factors between strains of S. aureus
     has been shown to occur through induction of prophage and can be induced by treatment with antibiotics.

INTRODUCTION Watson and Crick's identification of the structure of DNA in 1953 was the seminal event in the
field of genetic engineering. Since the 1970s, there has been a veritable explosion in scientists' ability to manipulate
DNA in ways that have revolutionized the fields of biology, medicine, diagnostics, forensics, and industrial
manufacturing. Many of the molecular tools discovered in recent decades have been produced using prokaryotic
microbes. In this chapter, we will explore some of those tools, especially as they relate to applications in medicine
and health care.
As an example, the thermal cycler in Figure 12.1 is used to perform a diagnostic technique called the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), which relies on DNA polymerase enzymes from thermophilic bacteria. Other molecular tools,
such as restriction enzymes and plasmids obtained from microorganisms, allow scientists to insert genes from
humans or other organisms into microorganisms. The microorganisms are then grown on an industrial scale to
synthesize products such as insulin, vaccines, and biodegradable polymers. These are just a few of the numerous
applications of microbial genetics that we will explore in this chapter.

       Part 1

       Kayla, a 24-year-old electrical engineer and running enthusiast, just moved from Arizona to New Hampshire to
       take a new job. On her weekends off, she loves to explore her new surroundings, going for long runs in the pine
       forests. In July she spent a week hiking through the mountains. In early August, Kayla developed a low fever,
       headache, and mild muscle aches, and she felt a bit fatigued. Not thinking much of it, she took some ibuprofen
       to combat her symptoms and vowed to get more rest.

     The science of using living systems to benefit humankind is called biotechnology. Technically speaking, the
     domestication of plants and animals through farming and breeding practices is a type of biotechnology. However, in
     a contemporary sense, we associate biotechnology with the direct alteration of an organism's genetics to achieve
     desirable traits through the process of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering involves the use of recombinant
     DNA technology, the process by which a DNA sequence is manipulated in vitro, thus creating recombinant DNA
     molecules that have new combinations of genetic material. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into a host
     organism. If the DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is now considered to be
     transgenic.

     Lydia Villa-Komaroff, working in Walter Gilbert's lab, demonstrated the groundbreaking power of biotechnology in
     1978. The group was the first to show that a transgenic bacterial strain could be used to create human insulin
     (Figure 12.2). The insulin gene from humans was inserted into a plasmid. This recombinant DNA plasmid was then
     inserted into bacteria. As a result, these transgenic microbes are able to produce and secrete human insulin. Many
     prokaryotes are able to acquire foreign DNA and incorporate functional genes into their own genome through
     "mating" with other cells (conjugation), viral infection (transduction), and taking up DNA from the environment
     (transformation). Recall that these mechanisms are examples of horizontal gene transfer--the transfer of genetic
     material between cells of the same generation.

     FIGURE 12.2 Recombinant DNA technology is the artificial recombination of DNA from two organisms. In this example, the human insulin
     gene is inserted into a bacterial plasmid. This recombinant plasmid can then be used to transform bacteria, which gain the ability to
     produce the insulin protein.

Molecular Cloning

Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen first demonstrated the complete molecular cloning process in 1973 when they
successfully cloned genes from the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) into a bacterial plasmid that was then
introduced into the bacterial host Escherichia coli. Molecular cloning is a set of methods used to construct
recombinant DNA and incorporate it into a host organism; it makes use of a number of molecular tools that are
derived from microorganisms.

Restriction Enzymes and Ligases
In recombinant DNA technology, DNA molecules are manipulated using naturally occurring enzymes derived mainly
from bacteria and viruses. The creation of recombinant DNA molecules is possible due to the use of naturally
occurring restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes), bacterial enzymes produced as a protection
mechanism to cut and destroy foreign cytoplasmic DNA that is most commonly a result of bacteriophage infection.
Stewart Linn and Werner Arber discovered restriction enzymes in their 1960s studies of how E. coli limits
bacteriophage replication on infection. Today, we use restriction enzymes extensively for cutting DNA fragments
that can then be spliced into another DNA molecule to form recombinant molecules. Each restriction enzyme cuts
DNA at a characteristic recognition site, a specific, usually palindromic, DNA sequence typically between four to six
base pairs in length. A palindrome is a sequence of letters that reads the same forward as backward. (The word
"level" is an example of a palindrome.) Palindromic DNA sequences contain the same base sequences in the 5 to 3
direction on one strand as in the 5 to 3 direction on the complementary strand. A restriction enzyme recognizes the
DNA palindrome and cuts each backbone at identical positions in the palindrome. Some restriction enzymes cut to
produce molecules that have complementary overhangs (sticky ends) while others cut without generating such
overhangs, instead producing blunt ends (Figure 12.3).

Molecules with complementary sticky ends can easily anneal, or form hydrogen bonds between complementary
bases, at their sticky ends. The annealing step allows hybridization of the single-stranded overhangs. Hybridization
refers to the joining together of two complementary single strands of DNA. Blunt ends can also attach together, but
less efficiently than sticky ends due to the lack of complementary overhangs facilitating the process. In either case,
ligation by DNA ligase can then rejoin the two sugar-phosphate backbones of the DNA through covalent bonding,
making the molecule a continuous double strand. In 1972, Paul Berg, a Stanford biochemist, was the first to
produce a recombinant DNA molecule using this technique, combining the SV40 monkey virus with E. coli
bacteriophage lambda to create a hybrid.
456  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     FIGURE 12.3 (a) In this six-nucleotide restriction enzyme site, recognized by the enzyme BamHI, notice that the sequence reads the same
     in the 5 to 3 direction on both strands. This is known as a palindrome. The cutting of the DNA by the restriction enzyme at the sites
     (indicated by the black arrows) produces DNA fragments with sticky ends. Another piece of DNA cut with the same restriction enzyme could
     attach to one of these sticky ends, forming a recombinant DNA molecule. (b) This four-nucleotide recognition site also exhibits a
     palindromic sequence. The cutting of the DNA by the restriction enzyme HaeIII at the indicated sites produces DNA fragments with blunt
     ends. Any other piece of blunt DNA could attach to one of the blunt ends produced, forming a recombinant DNA molecule.

     Plasmids
     After restriction digestion, genes of interest are commonly inserted into plasmids, small pieces of typically circular,
     double-stranded DNA that replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome (see Unique Characteristics of
     Prokaryotic Cells). In recombinant DNA technology, plasmids are often used as vectors, DNA molecules that carry
     DNA fragments from one organism to another. Plasmids used as vectors can be genetically engineered by
     researchers and scientific supply companies to have specialized properties, as illustrated by the commonly used
     plasmid vector pUC19 (Figure 12.4). Some plasmid vectors contain genes that confer antibiotic resistance; these
     resistance genes allow researchers to easily find plasmid-containing colonies by plating them on media containing
     the corresponding antibiotic. The antibiotic kills all host cells that do not harbor the desired plasmid vector, but
     those that contain the vector are able to survive and grow.

     Plasmid vectors used for cloning typically have a polylinker site, or multiple cloning site (MCS). A polylinker site is
     a short sequence containing multiple unique restriction enzyme recognition sites that are used for inserting DNA
     into the plasmid after restriction digestion of both the DNA and the plasmid. Having these multiple restriction
     enzyme recognition sites within the polylinker site makes the plasmid vector versatile, so it can be used for many
     different cloning experiments involving different restriction enzymes.

     This polylinker site is often found within a reporter gene, another gene sequence artificially engineered into the
     plasmid that encodes a protein that allows for visualization of DNA insertion. The reporter gene allows a researcher
     to distinguish host cells that contain recombinant plasmids with cloned DNA fragments from host cells that only
     contain the non-recombinant plasmid vector. The most common reporter gene used in plasmid vectors is the
     bacterial lacZ gene encoding beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that naturally degrades lactose but can also degrade a
     colorless synthetic analog X-gal, thereby producing blue colonies on X-gal-containing media. The lacZ reporter gene
     is disabled when the recombinant DNA is spliced into the plasmid. Because the LacZ protein is not produced when
     the gene is disabled, X-gal is not degraded and white colonies are produced, which can then be isolated. This blue-
     white screening method is described later and shown in Figure 12.5. In addition to these features, some plasmids
     come pre-digested and with an enzyme linked to the linearized plasmid to aid in ligation after the insertion of foreign

which the genes are transcribed. Note the polylinker site, containing multiple unique restriction enzyme recognition sites, found within the
lacZ reporter gene. Also note the ampicillin (amp) resistance gene encoded on the plasmid.

Molecular Cloning using Transformation
The most commonly used mechanism for introducing engineered plasmids into a bacterial cell is transformation, a
process in which bacteria take up free DNA from their surroundings. In nature, free DNA typically comes from other
lysed bacterial cells; in the laboratory, free DNA in the form of recombinant plasmids is introduced to the cell's
surroundings.

Some bacteria, such as Bacillus spp., are naturally competent, meaning they are able to take up foreign DNA.
However, not all bacteria are naturally competent. In most cases, bacteria must be made artificially competent in
the laboratory by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane. This can be achieved through chemical
treatments that neutralize charges on the cell membrane or by exposing the bacteria to an electric field that creates
microscopic pores in the cell membrane. These methods yield chemically competent or electrocompetent bacteria,
respectively.

Following the transformation protocol, bacterial cells are plated onto an antibiotic-containing medium to inhibit the
growth of the many host cells that were not transformed by the plasmid conferring antibiotic resistance. A technique
called blue-white screening is then used for lacZ-encoding plasmid vectors such as pUC19. Blue colonies have a
functional beta-galactosidase enzyme because the lacZ gene is uninterrupted, with no foreign DNA inserted into the
polylinker site. These colonies typically result from the digested, linearized plasmid religating to itself. However,
white colonies lack a functional beta-galactosidase enzyme, indicating the insertion of foreign DNA within the
polylinker site of the plasmid vector, thus disrupting the lacZ gene. Thus, white colonies resulting from this blue-
white screening contain plasmids with an insert and can be further screened to characterize the foreign DNA. To be
sure the correct DNA was incorporated into the plasmid, the DNA insert can then be sequenced.

     Molecular Cloning Using Conjugation or Transduction
     The bacterial process of conjugation (see How Asexual Prokaryotes Achieve Genetic Diversity) can also be
     manipulated for molecular cloning. F plasmids, or fertility plasmids, are transferred between bacterial cells through
     the process of conjugation. Recombinant DNA can be transferred by conjugation when bacterial cells containing a
     recombinant F plasmid are mixed with compatible bacterial cells lacking the plasmid. F plasmids encode a surface
     structure called an F pilus that facilitates contact between a cell containing an F plasmid and one without an F
     plasmid. On contact, a cytoplasmic bridge forms between the two cells and the F-plasmid-containing cell replicates
     its plasmid, transferring a copy of the recombinant F plasmid to the recipient cell. Once it has received the
     recombinant F plasmid, the recipient cell can produce its own F pilus and facilitate transfer of the recombinant F
     plasmid to an additional cell. The use of conjugation to transfer recombinant F plasmids to recipient cells is another
     effective way to introduce recombinant DNA molecules into host cells.

     Alternatively, bacteriophages can be used to introduce recombinant DNA into host bacterial cells through a
     manipulation of the transduction process (see How Asexual Prokaryotes Achieve Genetic Diversity). In the
     laboratory, DNA fragments of interest can be engineered into phagemids, which are plasmids that have phage
     sequences that allow them to be packaged into bacteriophages. Bacterial cells can then be infected with these
     bacteriophages so that the recombinant phagemids can be introduced into the bacterial cells. Depending on the
     type of phage, the recombinant DNA may be integrated into the host bacterial genome (lysogeny), or it may exist as
     a plasmid in the host's cytoplasm.

     Creating a Genomic Library

     Molecular cloning may also be used to generate a genomic library. The library is a complete (or nearly complete)
     copy of an organism's genome contained as recombinant DNA plasmids engineered into unique clones of bacteria.
     Having such a library allows a researcher to create large quantities of each fragment by growing the bacterial host
     for that fragment. These fragments can be used to determine the sequence of the DNA and the function of any
     genes present.

     One method for generating a genomic library is to ligate individual restriction enzyme-digested genomic fragments
     into plasmid vectors cut with the same restriction enzyme (Figure 12.6). After transformation into a bacterial host,
     each transformed bacterial cell takes up a single recombinant plasmid and grows into a colony of cells. All of the
     cells in this colony are identical clones and carry the same recombinant plasmid. The resulting library is a collection
     of colonies, each of which contains a fragment of the original organism's genome, that are each separate and
     distinct and can each be used for further study. This makes it possible for researchers to screen these different
     clones to discover the one containing a gene of interest from the original organism's genome.

     FIGURE 12.6 The generation of a genomic library facilitates the discovery of the genomic DNA fragment that contains a gene of interest.
     (credit "micrograph": modification of work by National Institutes of Health)

     To construct a genomic library using larger fragments of genomic DNA, an E. coli bacteriophage, such as lambda, can
     be used as a host (Figure 12.7). Genomic DNA can be sheared or enzymatically digested and ligated into a pre-
     digested bacteriophage lambda DNA vector. Then, these recombinant phage DNA molecules can be packaged into
     phage particles and used to infect E. coli host cells on a plate. During infection within each cell, each recombinant
     phage will make many copies of itself and lyse the E. coli lawn, forming a plaque. Thus, each plaque from a phage
     library represents a unique recombinant phage containing a distinct genomic DNA fragment. Plaques can then be
     screened further to look for genes of interest. One advantage to producing a library using phages instead of
     plasmids is that a phage particle holds a much larger insert of foreign DNA compared with a plasmid vector, thus
     requiring a much smaller number of cultures to fully represent the entire genome of the original organism.

     FIGURE 12.7 Recombinant phage DNA molecules are made by ligating digested phage particles with fragmented genomic DNA molecules.
     These recombinant phage DNA molecules are packaged into phage particles and allowed to infect a bacterial lawn. Each plaque represents

a unique recombinant DNA molecule that can be further screened for genes of interest.

To focus on the expressed genes in an organism or even a tissue, researchers construct libraries using the
organism's messenger RNA (mRNA) rather than its genomic DNA. Whereas all cells in a single organism will have the
same genomic DNA, different tissues express different genes, producing different complements of mRNA. For
example, all human cells' genomic DNA contains the gene for insulin, but only cells in the pancreas express mRNA
directing the production of insulin. Because mRNA cannot be cloned directly, in the laboratory mRNA must be used
as a template by the retroviral enzyme reverse transcriptase to make complementary DNA (cDNA). A cell's full
complement of mRNA can be reverse-transcribed into cDNA molecules, which can be used as a template for DNA
polymerase to make double-stranded DNA copies; these fragments can subsequently be ligated into either plasmid
vectors or bacteriophage to produce a cDNA library. The benefit of a cDNA library is that it contains DNA from only
the expressed genes in the cell. This means that the introns, control sequences such as promoters, and DNA not
destined to be translated into proteins are not represented in the library. The focus on translated sequences means
that the library cannot be used to study the sequence and structure of the genome in its entirety. The construction
of a cDNA genomic library is shown in Figure 12.8.

FIGURE 12.8 Complementary DNA (cDNA) is made from mRNA by the retroviral enzyme reverse transcriptase, converted into double-
stranded copies, and inserted into either plasmid vectors or bacteriophage, producing a cDNA library. (credit "micrograph": modification of

Introducing Recombinant Molecules into Eukaryotic Hosts

The use of bacterial hosts for genetic engineering laid the foundation for recombinant DNA technology; however,
researchers have also had great interest in genetically engineering eukaryotic cells, particularly those of plants and
animals. The introduction of recombinant DNA molecules into eukaryotic hosts is called transfection. Genetically
engineered plants, called transgenic plants, are of significant interest for agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes.
The first transgenic plant sold commercially was the Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato, which came to market in
1994. Genetically engineered livestock have also been successfully produced, resulting, for example, in pigs with
increased nutritional value1 and goats that secrete pharmaceutical products in their milk.2

Electroporation
Compared to bacterial cells, eukaryotic cells tend to be less amenable as hosts for recombinant DNA molecules.
Because eukaryotes are typically neither competent to take up foreign DNA nor able to maintain plasmids,

462  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     transfection of eukaryotic hosts is far more challenging and requires more intrusive techniques for success. One
     method used for transfecting cells in cell culture is called electroporation. A brief electric pulse induces the
     formation of transient pores in the phospholipid bilayers of cells through which the gene can be introduced. At the
     same time, the electric pulse generates a short-lived positive charge on one side of the cell's interior and a negative
     charge on the opposite side; the charge difference draws negatively charged DNA molecules into the cell (Figure
     12.9).

                              FIGURE 12.9 Electroporation is one laboratory technique used to introduce DNA into eukaryotic cells.

     Microinjection
     An alternative method of transfection is called microinjection. Because eukaryotic cells are typically larger than
     those of prokaryotes, DNA fragments can sometimes be directly injected into the cytoplasm using a glass
     micropipette, as shown in Figure 12.10.

     FIGURE 12.10 Microinjection is another technique for introducing DNA into eukaryotic cells. A microinjection needle containing
     recombinant DNA is able to penetrate both the cell membrane and nuclear envelope.

     Gene Guns
     Transfecting plant cells can be even more difficult than animal cells because of their thick cell walls. One approach
     involves treating plant cells with enzymes to remove their cell walls, producing protoplasts. Then, a gene gun is
     used to shoot gold or tungsten particles coated with recombinant DNA molecules into the plant protoplasts at high
     speeds. Recipient protoplast cells can then recover and be used to generate new transgenic plants (Figure 12.11).

of a gene gun. (credit a, b: modification of work by JA O'Brien, SC Lummis)

Shuttle Vectors

Another method of transfecting plants involves shuttle vectors, plasmids that can move between bacterial and
eukaryotic cells. The tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmids originating from the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens are
commonly used as shuttle vectors for incorporating genes into plants (Figure 12.12). In nature, the Ti plasmids of A.
tumefaciens cause plants to develop tumors when they are transferred from bacterial cells to plant cells.
Researchers have been able to manipulate these naturally occurring plasmids to remove their tumor-causing genes
and insert desirable DNA fragments. The resulting recombinant Ti plasmids can be transferred into the plant
genome through the natural transfer of Ti plasmids from the bacterium to the plant host. Once inside the plant host
cell, the gene of interest recombines into the plant cell's genome.
464  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     FIGURE 12.12 The Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a useful shuttle vector for the uptake of genes of interest into plant cells.
     The gene of interest is cloned into the Ti plasmid, which is then introduced into plant cells. The gene of interest then recombines into the
     plant cell's genome, allowing for the production of transgenic plants.

     Viral Vectors
     Viral vectors can also be used to transfect eukaryotic cells. In fact, this method is often used in gene therapy (see
     Gene Therapy) to introduce healthy genes into human patients suffering from diseases that result from genetic
     mutations. Viral genes can be deleted and replaced with the gene to be delivered to the patient;3 the virus then
     infects the host cell and delivers the foreign DNA into the genome of the targeted cell. Adenoviruses are often used
     for this purpose because they can be grown to high titer and can infect both nondividing and dividing host cells.
     However, use of viral vectors for gene therapy can pose some risks for patients, as discussed in Gene Therapy.

The sequence of a DNA molecule can help us identify an organism when compared to known sequences housed in a
database. The sequence can also tell us something about the function of a particular part of the DNA, such as
whether it encodes a particular protein. Comparing protein signatures--the expression levels of specific arrays of
proteins--between samples is an important method for evaluating cellular responses to a multitude of
environmental factors and stresses. Analysis of protein signatures can reveal the identity of an organism or how a
cell is responding during disease.

The DNA and proteins of interest are microscopic and typically mixed in with many other molecules including DNA
or proteins irrelevant to our interests. Many techniques have been developed to isolate and characterize molecules
of interest. These methods were originally developed for research purposes, but in many cases they have been
simplified to the point that routine clinical use is possible. For example, many pathogens, such as the bacterium
Helicobacter pylori, which causes stomach ulcers, can be detected using protein-based tests. In addition, an
increasing number of highly specific and accurate DNA amplification-based identification assays can now detect
pathogens such as antibiotic-resistant enteric bacteria, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and many
others.

Molecular Analysis of DNA

In this subsection, we will outline some of the basic methods used for separating and visualizing specific fragments
of DNA that are of interest to a scientist. Some of these methods do not require knowledge of the complete
sequence of the DNA molecule. Before the advent of rapid DNA sequencing, these methods were the only ones
available to work with DNA, but they still form the basic arsenal of tools used by molecular geneticists to study the
body's responses to microbial and other diseases.

Nucleic Acid Probing
DNA molecules are small, and the information contained in their sequence is invisible. How does a researcher
isolate a particular stretch of DNA, or having isolated it, determine what organism it is from, what its sequence is, or
what its function is? One method to identify the presence of a certain DNA sequence uses artificially constructed
pieces of DNA called probes. Probes can be used to identify different bacterial species in the environment and many
DNA probes are now available to detect pathogens clinically. For example, DNA probes are used to detect the
vaginal pathogens Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis.

To screen a genomic library for a particular gene or sequence of interest, researchers must know something about
that gene. If researchers have a portion of the sequence of DNA for the gene of interest, they can design a DNA
probe, a single-stranded DNA fragment that is complementary to part of the gene of interest and different from
other DNA sequences in the sample. The DNA probe may be synthesized chemically by commercial laboratories, or
it may be created by cloning, isolating, and denaturing a DNA fragment from a living organism. In either case, the
DNA probe must be labeled with a molecular tag or beacon, such as a radioactive phosphorus atom (as is used for
autoradiography) or a fluorescent dye (as is used in fluorescent in situ hybridization, or FISH), so that the probe and
the DNA it binds to can be seen (Figure 12.13). The DNA sample being probed must also be denatured to make it
single-stranded so that the single-stranded DNA probe can anneal to the single-stranded DNA sample at locations
where their sequences are complementary. While these techniques are valuable for diagnosis, their direct use on
466  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     sputum and other bodily samples may be problematic due to the complex nature of these samples. DNA often must
     first be isolated from bodily samples through chemical extraction methods before a DNA probe can be used to
     identify pathogens.

     FIGURE 12.13 DNA probes can be used to confirm the presence of a suspected pathogen in patient samples. This diagram illustrates how a
     DNA probe can be used to search for a gene of interest associated with the suspected pathogen.

       The mild, flu-like symptoms that Kayla is experiencing could be caused by any number of infectious agents. In
       addition, several non-infectious autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus
       erythematosus (SLE), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also have symptoms that are consistent with
       Kayla's early symptoms. However, over the course of several weeks, Kayla's symptoms worsened. She began to
       experience joint pain in her knees, heart palpitations, and a strange limpness in her facial muscles. In addition,
       she suffered from a stiff neck and painful headaches. Reluctantly, she decided it was time to seek medical
       attention.

     Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
     There are a number of situations in which a researcher might want to physically separate a collection of DNA
     fragments of different sizes. A researcher may also digest a DNA sample with a restriction enzyme to form
     fragments. The resulting size and fragment distribution pattern can often yield useful information about the
     sequence of DNA bases that can be used, much like a bar-code scan, to identify the individual or species to which
     the DNA belongs.

     Gel electrophoresis is a technique commonly used to separate biological molecules based on size and biochemical
     characteristics, such as charge and polarity. Agarose gel electrophoresis is widely used to separate DNA (or RNA)
     of varying sizes that may be generated by restriction enzyme digestion or by other means, such as the PCR (Figure
     12.14).

     Due to its negatively charged backbone, DNA is strongly attracted to a positive electrode. In agarose gel
     electrophoresis, the gel is oriented horizontally in a buffer solution. Samples are loaded into sample wells on the
     side of the gel closest to the negative electrode, then drawn through the molecular sieve of the agarose matrix
     toward the positive electrode. The agarose matrix impedes the movement of larger molecules through the gel,
     whereas smaller molecules pass through more readily. Thus, the distance of migration is inversely correlated to the

size of the DNA fragment, with smaller fragments traveling a longer distance through the gel. Sizes of DNA
fragments within a sample can be estimated by comparison to fragments of known size in a DNA ladder also run on
the same gel. To separate very large DNA fragments, such as chromosomes or viral genomes, agarose gel
electrophoresis can be modified by periodically alternating the orientation of the electric field during pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In PFGE, smaller fragments can reorient themselves and migrate slightly faster than
larger fragments and this technique can thus serve to separate very large fragments that would otherwise travel
together during standard agarose gel electrophoresis. In any of these electrophoresis techniques, the locations of
the DNA or RNA fragments in the gel can be detected by various methods. One common method is adding ethidium
bromide, a stain that inserts into the nucleic acids at non-specific locations and can be visualized when exposed to
ultraviolet light. Other stains that are safer than ethidium bromide, a potential carcinogen, are now available.

     Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) Analysis
     Restriction enzyme recognition sites are short (only a few nucleotides long), sequence-specific palindromes, and
     may be found throughout the genome. Thus, differences in DNA sequences in the genomes of individuals will lead to
     differences in distribution of restriction-enzyme recognition sites that can be visualized as distinct banding patterns

on a gel after agarose gel electrophoresis. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis compares
DNA banding patterns of different DNA samples after restriction digestion (Figure 12.15).

RFLP analysis has many practical applications in both medicine and forensic science. For example, epidemiologists
use RFLP analysis to track and identify the source of specific microorganisms implicated in outbreaks of food
poisoning or certain infectious diseases. RFLP analysis can also be used on human DNA to determine inheritance
patterns of chromosomes with variant genes, including those associated with heritable diseases or to establish
paternity.

Forensic scientists use RFLP analysis as a form of DNA fingerprinting, which is useful for analyzing DNA obtained
from crime scenes, suspects, and victims. DNA samples are collected, the numbers of copies of the sample DNA
molecules are increased using PCR, and then subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel
electrophoresis to generate specific banding patterns. By comparing the banding patterns of samples collected from
the crime scene against those collected from suspects or victims, investigators can definitively determine whether
DNA evidence collected at the scene was left behind by suspects or victims.

FIGURE 12.15 RFLP analysis can be used to differentiate DNA sequences. In this example, a normal chromosome is digested into two
fragments, whereas digestion of a mutated chromosome produces only one fragment. The small red arrows pointing to the two different
chromosome segments show the locations of the restriction enzyme recognition sites. After digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, the
banding patterns reflect the change by showing the loss of two shorter bands and the gain of a longer band. (credit: modification of work by

Southern Blots and Modifications
Several molecular techniques capitalize on sequence complementarity and hybridization between nucleic acids of a
sample and DNA probes. Typically, probing nucleic-acid samples within a gel is unsuccessful because as the DNA
probe soaks into a gel, the sample nucleic acids within the gel diffuse out. Thus, blotting techniques are commonly
used to transfer nucleic acids to a thin, positively charged membrane made of nitrocellulose or nylon. In the
Southern blot technique, developed by Sir Edwin Southern in 1975, DNA fragments within a sample are first
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a membrane through capillary action (Figure
12.16). The DNA fragments that bind to the surface of the membrane are then exposed to a specific single-stranded
DNA probe labeled with a radioactive or fluorescent molecular beacon to aid in detection. Southern blots may be
used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given DNA sample. Once the target DNA within the
membrane is visualized, researchers can cut out the portion of the membrane containing the fragment to recover
the DNA fragment of interest.
470  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     FIGURE 12.16 In the Southern blot technique, DNA fragments are first separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, then transferred by
     capillary action to a nylon membrane, which is then soaked with a DNA probe tagged with a molecular beacon for easy visualization.

     Variations of the Southern blot--the dot blot, slot blot, and the spot blot--do not involve electrophoresis, but instead
     concentrate DNA from a sample into a small location on a membrane. After hybridization with a DNA probe, the
     signal intensity detected is measured, allowing the researcher to estimate the amount of target DNA present within
     the sample.

     A colony blot is another variation of the Southern blot in which colonies representing different clones in a genomic
     library are transferred to a membrane by pressing the membrane onto the culture plate. The cells on the membrane
     are lysed and the membrane can then be probed to determine which colonies within a genomic library harbor the
     target gene. Because the colonies on the plate are still growing, the cells of interest can be isolated from the plate.

     In the northern blot, another variation of the Southern blot, RNA (not DNA) is immobilized on the membrane and
     probed. Northern blots are typically used to detect the amount of mRNA made through gene expression within a
     tissue or organism sample.

     Microarray Analysis
     Another technique that capitalizes on the hybridization between complementary nucleic acid sequences is called
     microarray analysis. Microarray analysis is useful for the comparison of gene-expression patterns between
     different cell types--for example, cells infected with a virus versus uninfected cells, or cancerous cells versus
     healthy cells (Figure 12.17).

     Typically, DNA or cDNA from an experimental sample is deposited on a glass slide alongside known DNA sequences.
     Each slide can hold more than 30,000 different DNA fragment types. Distinct DNA fragments (encompassing an
     organism's entire genomic library) or cDNA fragments (corresponding to an organism's full complement of
     expressed genes) can be individually spotted on a glass slide.

     Once deposited on the slide, genomic DNA or mRNA can be isolated from the two samples for comparison. If mRNA
     is isolated, it is reverse-transcribed to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. Then the two samples of genomic DNA or
     cDNA are labeled with different fluorescent dyes (typically red and green). The labeled genomic DNA samples are
     then combined in equal amounts, added to the microarray chip, and allowed to hybridize to complementary spots
     on the microarray.

     Hybridization of sample genomic DNA molecules can be monitored by measuring the intensity of fluorescence at

particular spots on the microarray. Differences in the amount of hybridization between the samples can be readily
observed. If only one sample's nucleic acids hybridize to a particular spot on the microarray, then that spot will
appear either green or red. However, if both samples' nucleic acids hybridize, then the spot will appear yellow due to
the combination of the red and green dyes.

Although microarray technology allows for a holistic comparison between two samples in a short time, it requires
sophisticated (and expensive) detection equipment and analysis software. Because of the expense, this technology
is typically limited to research settings. Researchers have used microarray analysis to study how gene expression is
affected in organisms that are infected by bacteria or viruses or subjected to certain chemical treatments.

FIGURE 12.17 (a) The steps in microarray analysis are illustrated. Here, gene expression patterns are compared between cancerous cells
and healthy cells. (b) Microarray information can be expressed as a heat map. Genes are shown on the left side; different samples are
shown across the bottom. Genes expressed only in cancer cells are shown in varying shades of red; genes expressed only in normal cells
are shown in varying shades of green. Genes that are expressed in both cancerous and normal cells are shown in yellow.

In many cases it may not be desirable or possible to study DNA or RNA directly. Proteins can provide species-
specific information for identification as well as important information about how and whether a cell or tissue is
responding to the presence of a pathogenic microorganism. Various proteins require different methods for isolation

     and characterization.

     Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
     A variation of gel electrophoresis, called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), is commonly used for
     separating proteins. In PAGE, the gel matrix is finer and composed of polyacrylamide instead of agarose.
     Additionally, PAGE is typically performed using a vertical gel apparatus (Figure 12.18). Because of the varying
     charges associated with amino acid side chains, PAGE can be used to separate intact proteins based on their net
     charges. Alternatively, proteins can be denatured and coated with a negatively charged detergent called sodium
     dodecyl sulfate (SDS), masking the native charges and allowing separation based on size only. PAGE can be further
     modified to separate proteins based on two characteristics, such as their charges at various pHs as well as their
     size, through the use of two-dimensional PAGE. In any of these cases, following electrophoresis, proteins are
     visualized through staining, commonly with either Coomassie blue or a silver stain.

CLINICAL FOCUS

Part 3

When Kayla described her symptoms, her physician at first suspected bacterial meningitis, which is consistent
with her headaches and stiff neck. However, she soon ruled this out as a possibility because meningitis typically
progresses more quickly than what Kayla was experiencing. Many of her symptoms still paralleled those of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the physician also considered
Lyme disease a possibility given how much time Kayla spends in the woods. Kayla did not recall any recent tick
bites (the typical means by which Lyme disease is transmitted) and she did not have the typical bull's-eye rash
associated with Lyme disease (Figure 12.19). However, 20-30% of patients with Lyme disease never develop
this rash, so the physician did not want to rule it out.

Kayla's doctor ordered an MRI of her brain, a complete blood count to test for anemia, blood tests assessing
liver and kidney function, and additional tests to confirm or rule out SLE or Lyme disease. Her test results were
inconsistent with both SLE and ALS, and the result of the test looking for Lyme disease antibodies was
"equivocal," meaning inconclusive. Having ruled out ALS and SLE, Kayla's doctor decided to run additional tests
for Lyme disease.

Amplification-Based DNA Analysis Methods

Various methods can be used for obtaining sequences of DNA, which are useful for studying disease-causing
organisms. With the advent of rapid sequencing technology, our knowledge base of the entire genomes of
pathogenic organisms has grown phenomenally. We start with a description of the polymerase chain reaction, which
is not a sequencing method but has allowed researchers and clinicians to obtain the large quantities of DNA needed
for sequencing and other studies. The polymerase chain reaction eliminates the dependence we once had on cells
to make multiple copies of DNA, achieving the same result through relatively simple reactions outside the cell.
474  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
     Most methods of DNA analysis, such as restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, or DNA
     sequencing require large amounts of a specific DNA fragment. In the past, large amounts of DNA were produced by
     growing the host cells of a genomic library. However, libraries take time and effort to prepare and DNA samples of
     interest often come in minute quantities. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) permits rapid amplification in the
     number of copies of specific DNA sequences for further analysis (Figure 12.20). One of the most powerful
     techniques in molecular biology, PCR was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis while at Cetus Corporation. PCR has
     specific applications in research, forensic, and clinical laboratories, including:

         · determining the sequence of nucleotides in a specific region of DNA
         · amplifying a target region of DNA for cloning into a plasmid vector
         · identifying the source of a DNA sample left at a crime scene
         · analyzing samples to determine paternity
         · comparing samples of ancient DNA with modern organisms
         · determining the presence of difficult to culture, or unculturable, microorganisms in humans or environmental

             samples

     PCR is an in vitro laboratory technique that takes advantage of the natural process of DNA replication. The heat-
     stable DNA polymerase enzymes used in PCR are derived from hyperthermophilic prokaryotes. Taq DNA
     polymerase, commonly used in PCR, is derived from the Thermus aquaticus bacterium isolated from a hot spring in
     Yellowstone National Park. DNA replication requires the use of primers for the initiation of replication to have free
     3-hydroxyl groups available for the addition of nucleotides by DNA polymerase. However, while primers composed
     of RNA are normally used in cells, DNA primers are used for PCR. DNA primers are preferable due to their stability,
     and DNA primers with known sequences targeting a specific DNA region can be chemically synthesized
     commercially. These DNA primers are functionally similar to the DNA probes used for the various hybridization
     techniques described earlier, binding to specific targets due to complementarity between the target DNA sequence
     and the primer.

     PCR occurs over multiple cycles, each containing three steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. Machines
     called thermal cyclers are used for PCR; these machines can be programmed to automatically cycle through the
     temperatures required at each step (Figure 12.1). First, double-stranded template DNA containing the target
     sequence is denatured at approximately 95 °C. The high temperature required to physically (rather than
     enzymatically) separate the DNA strands is the reason the heat-stable DNA polymerase is required. Next, the
     temperature is lowered to approximately 50 °C. This allows the DNA primers complementary to the ends of the
     target sequence to anneal (stick) to the template strands, with one primer annealing to each strand. Finally, the
     temperature is raised to 72 °C, the optimal temperature for the activity of the heat-stable DNA polymerase, allowing
     for the addition of nucleotides to the primer using the single-stranded target as a template. Each cycle doubles the
     number of double-stranded target DNA copies. Typically, PCR protocols include 25-40 cycles, allowing for the
     amplification of a single target sequence by tens of millions to over a trillion.

     Natural DNA replication is designed to copy the entire genome, and initiates at one or more origin sites. Primers are
     constructed during replication, not before, and do not consist of a few specific sequences. PCR targets specific
     regions of a DNA sample using sequence-specific primers. In recent years, a variety of isothermal PCR amplification
     methods that circumvent the need for thermal cycling have been developed, taking advantage of accessory proteins
     that aid in the DNA replication process. As the development of these methods continues and their use becomes
     more widespread in research, forensic, and clinical labs, thermal cyclers may become obsolete.

PCR Variations
Several later modifications to PCR further increase the utility of this technique. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-
PCR) is used for obtaining DNA copies of a specific mRNA molecule. RT-PCR begins with the use of the reverse
transcriptase enzyme to convert mRNA molecules into cDNA. That cDNA is then used as a template for traditional
PCR amplification. RT-PCR can detect whether a specific gene has been expressed in a sample. Another recent
application of PCR is real-time PCR, also known as quantitative PCR (qPCR). Standard PCR and RT-PCR protocols
are not quantitative because any one of the reagents may become limiting before all of the cycles within the
protocol are complete, and samples are only analyzed at the end. Because it is not possible to determine when in
the PCR or RT-PCR protocol a given reagent has become limiting, it is not possible to know how many cycles were
completed prior to this point, and thus it is not possible to determine how many original template molecules were
present in the sample at the start of PCR. In qPCR, however, the use of fluorescence allows one to monitor the
increase in a double-stranded template during a PCR reaction as it occurs. These kinetics data can then be used to
quantify the amount of the original target sequence. The use of qPCR in recent years has further expanded the
capabilities of PCR, allowing researchers to determine the number of DNA copies, and sometimes organisms,
476  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     present in a sample. In clinical settings, qRT-PCR is used to determine viral load in HIV-positive patients to evaluate
     the effectiveness of their therapy.

     DNA Sequencing
     A basic sequencing technique is the chain termination method, also known as the dideoxy method or the Sanger
     DNA sequencing method, developed by Frederick Sanger in 1972. The chain termination method involves DNA
     replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a DNA primer to initiate synthesis of a complementary
     strand, DNA polymerase, a mix of the four regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP) monomers, and a small proportion of
     dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), each labeled with a molecular beacon. The ddNTPs are monomers missing a hydroxyl
     group (-OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (Figure 12.21). Every time a
     ddNTP is randomly incorporated into the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA
     replication for that particular strand. This results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each
     terminated at a different point during replication. When the reaction mixture is subjected to gel electrophoresis, the
     multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder of differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are labeled, each band
     on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand when the ddNTP terminated the reaction.

     In Sanger's day, four reactions were set up for each DNA molecule being sequenced, each reaction containing only
     one of the four possible ddNTPs. Each ddNTP was labeled with a radioactive phosphorus molecule. The products of
     the four reactions were then run in separate lanes side by side on long, narrow PAGE gels, and the bands of varying
     lengths were detected by autoradiography. Today, this process has been simplified with the use of ddNTPs, each
     labeled with a different colored fluorescent dye or fluorochrome (Figure 12.22), in one sequencing reaction
     containing all four possible ddNTPs for each DNA molecule being sequenced (Figure 12.23). These fluorochromes
     are detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. Determining the fluorescence color of each band as it passes by the
     detector produces the nucleotide sequence of the template strand.

     FIGURE 12.21 A dideoxynucleotide is similar in structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is missing the 3 hydroxyl group (indicated by the
     shaded box). When a dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.

Since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories fall under the umbrella of next generation
sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These methods have
revolutionized the field of molecular genetics because the low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of
hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 600 base pairs) just in one day. Although several
variants of next generation sequencing technologies are made by different companies (for example, 454 Life
Sciences' pyrosequencing and Illumina's Solexa technology), they all allow millions of bases to be sequenced
quickly, making the sequencing of entire genomes relatively easy, inexpensive, and commonplace. In 454
sequencing (pyrosequencing), for example, a DNA sample is fragmented into 400-600-bp single-strand
fragments, modified with the addition of DNA adapters to both ends of each fragment. Each DNA fragment is then
immobilized on a bead and amplified by PCR, using primers designed to anneal to the adapters, creating a bead
containing many copies of that DNA fragment. Each bead is then put into a separate well containing sequencing
enzymes. To the well, each of the four nucleotides is added one after the other; when each one is incorporated,
pyrophosphate is released as a byproduct of polymerization, emitting a small flash of light that is recorded by a
detector. This provides the order of nucleotides incorporated as a new strand of DNA is made and is an example of
synthesis sequencing. Next generation sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome
process of putting all the fragments in order. Overall, these technologies continue to advance rapidly, decreasing the
478  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     cost of sequencing and increasing the availability of sequence data from a wide variety of organisms quickly.

     The National Center for Biotechnology Information houses a widely used genetic sequence database called
     GenBank where researchers deposit genetic information for public use. Upon publication of sequence data,
     researchers upload it to GenBank, giving other researchers access to the information. The collaboration allows

     CASE IN POINT

     Using a NAAT to Diagnose a C. difficile Infection

     Javier, an 80-year-old patient with a history of heart disease, recently returned home from the hospital after
     undergoing an angioplasty procedure to insert a stent into a cardiac artery. To minimize the possibility of
     infection, Javier was administered intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics during and shortly after his
     procedure. He was released four days after the procedure, but a week later, he began to experience mild
     abdominal cramping and watery diarrhea several times a day. He lost his appetite, became severely dehydrated,
     and developed a fever. He also noticed blood in his stool. Javier's wife called the physician, who instructed her
     to take him to the emergency room immediately.

     The hospital staff ran several tests and found that Javier's kidney creatinine levels were elevated compared with
     the levels in his blood, indicating that his kidneys were not functioning well. Javier's symptoms suggested a
     possible infection with Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that is resistant to many antibiotics. The hospital
     collected and cultured a stool sample to look for the production of toxins A and B by C. difficile, but the results
     came back negative. However, the negative results were not enough to rule out a C. difficile infection because
     culturing of C. difficile and detection of its characteristic toxins can be difficult, particularly in some types of
     samples. To be safe, they proceeded with a diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Currently NAATs
     are the clinical diagnostician's gold standard for detecting the genetic material of a pathogen. In Javier's case,
     qPCR was used to look for the gene encoding C. difficile toxin B (tcdB). When the qPCR analysis came back
     positive, the attending physician concluded that Javier was indeed suffering from a C. difficile infection and
     immediately prescribed the antibiotic vancomycin, to be administered intravenously. The antibiotic cleared the
     infection and Javier made a full recovery.

     Because infections with C. difficile were becoming widespread in Javier's community, his sample was further
     analyzed to see whether the specific strain of C. difficile could be identified. Javier's stool sample was subjected
     to ribotyping and repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) analysis. In ribotyping, a short sequence of DNA
     between the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes is amplified and subjected to restriction digestion (Figure 12.24).
     This sequence varies between strains of C. difficile, so restriction enzymes will cut in different places. In rep-
     PCR, DNA primers designed to bind to short sequences commonly found repeated within the C. difficile genome
     were used for PCR. Following restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed in both types of
     analysis to examine the banding patterns that resulted from each procedure (Figure 12.25). Rep-PCR can be
     used to further subtype various ribotypes, increasing resolution for detecting differences between strains. The
     ribotype of the strain infecting Javier was found to be ribotype 27, a strain known for its increased virulence,

     12.3 Whole Genome Methods and Pharmaceutical Applications of Genetic
     Engineering

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the uses of genome-wide comparative analyses
         · Summarize the advantages of genetically engineered pharmaceutical products

     Advances in molecular biology have led to the creation of entirely new fields of science. Among these are fields that
     study aspects of whole genomes, collectively referred to as whole-genome methods. In this section, we'll provide a
     brief overview of the whole-genome fields of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.

     Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Proteomics

     The study and comparison of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes and their nucleotide sequence
     and organization, is called genomics. This field has great potential for future medical advances through the study of
     the human genome as well as the genomes of infectious organisms. Analysis of microbial genomes has contributed
     to the development of new antibiotics, diagnostic tools, vaccines, medical treatments, and environmental cleanup
     techniques.

     The field of transcriptomics is the science of the entire collection of mRNA molecules produced by cells. Scientists
     compare gene expression patterns between infected and uninfected host cells, gaining important information about
     the cellular responses to infectious disease. Additionally, transcriptomics can be used to monitor the gene
     expression of virulence factors in microorganisms, aiding scientists in better understanding pathogenic processes
     from this viewpoint.

     When genomics and transcriptomics are applied to entire microbial communities, we use the terms metagenomics
     and metatranscriptomics, respectively. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics allow researchers to study genes
     and gene expression from a collection of multiple species, many of which may not be easily cultured or cultured at
     all in the laboratory. A DNA microarray (discussed in the previous section) can be used in metagenomics studies.

     Another up-and-coming clinical application of genomics and transcriptomics is pharmacogenomics, also called
     toxicogenomics, which involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an
     individual's genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as
     laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Changes in gene
     expression in the presence of a drug can sometimes be an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. Personal
     genome sequence information may someday be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least
     toxic on the basis of the individual patient's genotype.

     The study of proteomics is an extension of genomics that allows scientists to study the entire complement of
     proteins in an organism, called the proteome. Even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of
     genes, cells in various tissues produce different sets of proteins. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome
     varies and is dynamic within an organism. Proteomics may be used to study which proteins are expressed under
     various conditions within a single cell type or to compare protein expression patterns between different organisms.

     The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer, but this area of study is also being
     applied to infectious diseases. Research is currently underway to examine the feasibility of using proteomic
     approaches to diagnose various types of hepatitis, tuberculosis, and HIV infection, which are rather difficult to
     diagnose using currently available techniques.5

     A recent and developing proteomic analysis relies on identifying proteins called biomarkers, whose expression is
     affected by the disease process. Biomarkers are currently being used to detect various forms of cancer as well as
     infections caused by pathogens such as Yersinia pestis and Vaccinia virus.6

     Other "-omic" sciences related to genomics and proteomics include metabolomics, glycomics, and lipidomics,

which focus on the complete set of small-molecule metabolites, sugars, and lipids, respectively, found within a cell.
Through these various global approaches, scientists continue to collect, compile, and analyze large amounts of
genetic information. This emerging field of bioinformatics can be used, among many other applications, for clues to
treating diseases and understanding the workings of cells.

Additionally, researchers can use reverse genetics, a technique related to classic mutational analysis, to determine
the function of specific genes. Classic methods of studying gene function involved searching for the genes
responsible for a given phenotype. Reverse genetics uses the opposite approach, starting with a specific DNA
sequence and attempting to determine what phenotype it produces. Alternatively, scientists can attach known
genes (called reporter genes) that encode easily observable characteristics to genes of interest, and the location of
expression of such genes of interest can be easily monitored. This gives the researcher important information about
what the gene product might be doing or where it is located in the organism. Common reporter genes include
bacterial lacZ, which encodes beta-galactosidase and whose activity can be monitored by changes in colony color in
the presence of X-gal as previously described, and the gene encoding the jellyfish protein green fluorescent protein
(GFP) whose activity can be visualized in colonies under ultraviolet light exposure (Figure 12.26).

patterns in organisms. Under ultraviolet light, GFP fluoresces. Here, two mice are expressing GFP, while the middle mouse is not. (b) GFP

  CLINICAL FOCUS

  Resolution

  Because Kayla's symptoms were persistent and serious enough to interfere with daily activities, Kayla's
  physician decided to order some laboratory tests. The physician collected samples of Kayla's blood,
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and synovial fluid (from one of her swollen knees) and requested PCR analysis on all
  three samples. The PCR tests on the CSF and synovial fluid came back positive for the presence of Borrelia
  burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.

  Kayla's physician immediately prescribed a full course of the antibiotic doxycycline. Fortunately, Kayla recovered
  fully within a few weeks and did not suffer from the long-term symptoms of post-treatment Lyme disease
  syndrome (PTLDS), which affects 10-20% of Lyme disease patients. To prevent future infections, Kayla's
  physician advised her to use insect repellant and wear protective clothing during her outdoor adventures. These
482  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

       measures can limit exposure to Lyme-bearing ticks, which are common in many regions of the United States
       during the warmer months of the year. Kayla was also advised to make a habit of examining herself for ticks after
       returning from outdoor activities, as prompt removal of a tick greatly reduces the chances of infection.

       Lyme disease is often difficult to diagnose. B. burgdorferi is not easily cultured in the laboratory, and the initial
       symptoms can be very mild and resemble those of many other diseases. But left untreated, the symptoms can
       become quite severe and debilitating. In addition to two antibody tests, which were inconclusive in Kayla's case,
       and the PCR test, a Southern blot could be used with B. burgdorferi-specific DNA probes to identify DNA from
       the pathogen. Sequencing of surface protein genes of Borrelia species is also being used to identify strains
       within the species that may be more readily transmitted to humans or cause more severe disease.

     Recombinant DNA Technology and Pharmaceutical Production

     Genetic engineering has provided a way to create new pharmaceutical products called recombinant DNA
     pharmaceuticals. Such products include antibiotic drugs, vaccines, and hormones used to treat various diseases.
     Table 12.1 lists examples of recombinant DNA products and their uses.

     For example, the naturally occurring antibiotic synthesis pathways of various Streptomyces spp., long known for
     their antibiotic production capabilities, can be modified to improve yields or to create new antibiotics through the
     introduction of genes encoding additional enzymes. More than 200 new antibiotics have been generated through the
     targeted inactivation of genes and the novel combination of antibiotic synthesis genes in antibiotic-producing
     Streptomyces hosts.7

     Genetic engineering is also used to manufacture subunit vaccines, which are safer than other vaccines because they
     contain only a single antigenic molecule and lack any part of the genome of the pathogen (see Vaccines). For
     example, a vaccine for hepatitis B is created by inserting a gene encoding a hepatitis B surface protein into a yeast;
     the yeast then produces this protein, which the human immune system recognizes as an antigen. The hepatitis B
     antigen is purified from yeast cultures and administered to patients as a vaccine. Even though the vaccine does not
     contain the hepatitis B virus, the presence of the antigenic protein stimulates the immune system to produce
     antibodies that will protect the patient against the virus in the event of exposure.8 9

     Genetic engineering has also been important in the production of other therapeutic proteins, such as insulin,
     interferons, and human growth hormone, to treat a variety of human medical conditions. For example, at one time, it
     was possible to treat diabetes only by giving patients pig insulin, which had supply limitations and caused allergic
     reactions due to small differences between the proteins expressed in human and pig insulin. Villa-Komaroff's and
     the Gilbert team's groundbreaking methods changed that. After they demonstrated the process for producing the
     hormone, the FDA approved the resulting synthetic insulin for human use. And since 1982, recombinant DNA
     technology has been used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin using E. coli in a relatively inexpensive
     process that yields a more consistently effective pharmaceutical product. Scientists have also genetically
     engineered E. coli capable of producing human growth hormone (HGH), which is used to treat growth disorders in
     children and certain other disorders in adults. The HGH gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E.
     coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector. Eventually, genetic engineering will be used to produce DNA vaccines
     and various gene therapies, as well as customized medicines for fighting cancer and other diseases.

RNA Interference Technology

In Structure and Function of RNA, we described the function of mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA. In addition to these types of
RNA, cells also produce several types of small noncoding RNA molecules that are involved in the regulation of gene
expression. These include antisense RNA molecules, which are complementary to regions of specific mRNA
molecules found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells. Non-coding RNA molecules play a major role in RNA
interference (RNAi), a natural regulatory mechanism by which mRNA molecules are prevented from guiding the
synthesis of proteins. RNA interference of specific genes results from the base pairing of short, single-stranded
antisense RNA molecules to regions within complementary mRNA molecules, preventing protein synthesis. Cells
use RNA interference to protect themselves from viral invasion, which may introduce double-stranded RNA
molecules as part of the viral replication process (Figure 12.27).
484  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     FIGURE 12.27 Cells like the eukaryotic cell shown in this diagram commonly make small antisense RNA molecules with sequences
     complementary to specific mRNA molecules. When an antisense RNA molecule is bound to an mRNA molecule, the mRNA can no longer be
     used to direct protein synthesis. (credit: modification of work by Robinson R)

     Researchers are currently developing techniques to mimic the natural process of RNA interference as a way to treat
     viral infections in eukaryotic cells. RNA interference technology involves using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or
     microRNAs (miRNAs) (Figure 12.28). siRNAs are completely complementary to the mRNA transcript of a specific
     gene of interest while miRNAs are mostly complementary. These double-stranded RNAs are bound to DICER, an
     endonuclease that cleaves the RNA into short molecules (approximately 20 nucleotides long). The RNAs are then
     bound to RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a ribonucleoprotein. The siRNA-RISC complex binds to mRNA and
     cleaves it. For miRNA, only one of the two strands binds to RISC. The miRNA-RISC complex then binds to mRNA,
     inhibiting translation. If the miRNA is completely complementary to the target gene, then the mRNA can be cleaved.
     Taken together, these mechanisms are known as gene silencing.

12.4 Gene Therapy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Summarize the mechanisms, risks, and potential benefits of gene therapy
    · Identify ethical issues involving gene therapy and the regulatory agencies that provide oversight for

        clinical trials
    · Compare somatic-cell and germ-line gene therapy

Many types of genetic engineering have yielded clear benefits with few apparent risks. Few would question, for
example, the value of our now abundant supply of human insulin produced by genetically engineered bacteria.
However, many emerging applications of genetic engineering are much more controversial, often because their
potential benefits are pitted against significant risks, real or perceived. This is certainly the case for gene therapy, a
clinical application of genetic engineering that may one day provide a cure for many diseases but is still largely an
experimental approach to treatment.

Mechanisms and Risks of Gene Therapy

Human diseases that result from genetic mutations are often difficult to treat with drugs or other traditional forms of
therapy because the signs and symptoms of disease result from abnormalities in a patient's genome. For example, a
patient may have a genetic mutation that prevents the expression of a specific protein required for the normal
function of a particular cell type. This is the case in patients with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a
genetic disease that impairs the function of certain white blood cells essential to the immune system.

Gene therapy attempts to correct genetic abnormalities by introducing a nonmutated, functional gene into the
patient's genome. The nonmutated gene encodes a functional protein that the patient would otherwise be unable to
produce. Viral vectors such as adenovirus are sometimes used to introduce the functional gene; part of the viral
genome is removed and replaced with the desired gene (Figure 12.29). More advanced forms of gene therapy
attempt to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of SCID.

FIGURE 12.29 Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to treat or cure certain genetic diseases in which a patient has a
defective gene. (credit: modification of work by National Institutes of Health)

So far, gene therapies have proven relatively ineffective, with the possible exceptions of treatments for cystic
fibrosis and adenosine deaminase deficiency, a type of SCID. Other trials have shown the clear hazards of
attempting genetic manipulation in complex multicellular organisms like humans. In some patients, the use of an
adenovirus vector can trigger an unanticipated inflammatory response from the immune system, which may lead to
organ failure. Moreover, because viruses can often target multiple cell types, the virus vector may infect cells not
targeted for the therapy, damaging these other cells and possibly leading to illnesses such as cancer. Another
potential risk is that the modified virus could revert to being infectious and cause disease in the patient. Lastly, there
486  12 · Modern Applications of Microbial Genetics

     is a risk that the inserted gene could unintentionally inactivate another important gene in the patient's genome,
     disrupting normal cell cycling and possibly leading to tumor formation and cancer. Because gene therapy involves so
     many risks, candidates for gene therapy need to be fully informed of these risks before providing informed consent
     to undergo the therapy.

       CASE IN POINT

       Gene Therapy Gone Wrong

       The risks of gene therapy were realized in the 1999 case of Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old patient who
       received gene therapy as part of a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania. Jesse received gene therapy for
       a condition called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, which leads to ammonia accumulation in the
       blood due to deficient ammonia processing. Four days after the treatment, Jesse died after a massive immune
       response to the adenovirus vector.10

       Until that point, researchers had not really considered an immune response to the vector to be a legitimate risk,
       but on investigation, it appears that the researchers had some evidence suggesting that this was a possible
       outcome. Prior to Jesse's treatment, several other human patients had suffered side effects of the treatment,
       and three monkeys used in a trial had died as a result of inflammation and clotting disorders. Despite this
       information, it appears that neither Jesse nor his family were made aware of these outcomes when they
       consented to the therapy. Jesse's death was the first patient death due to a gene therapy treatment and resulted
       in the immediate halting of the clinical trial in which he was involved, the subsequent halting of all other gene
       therapy trials at the University of Pennsylvania, and the investigation of all other gene therapy trials in the United
       States. As a result, the regulation and oversight of gene therapy overall was reexamined, resulting in new
       regulatory protocols that are still in place today.

         · Identify some risks of gene therapy.

     Oversight of Gene Therapy

     Presently, there is significant oversight of gene therapy clinical trials. At the federal level, three agencies regulate
     gene therapy in parallel: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP),
     and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Along with several
     local agencies, these federal agencies interact with the institutional review board to ensure that protocols are in
     place to protect patient safety during clinical trials. Compliance with these protocols is enforced mostly on the local
     level in cooperation with the federal agencies. Gene therapies are currently under the most extensive federal and
     local review compared to other types of therapies, which are more typically only under the review of the FDA. Some
     researchers believe that these extensive regulations actually inhibit progress in gene therapy research. In 2013, the
     Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) called upon the NIH to relax its review of gene
     therapy trials in most cases.11 However, ensuring patient safety continues to be of utmost concern.

     Ethical Concerns
     Beyond the health risks of gene therapy, the ability to genetically modify humans poses a number of ethical issues
     related to the limits of such "therapy." While current research is focused on gene therapy for genetic diseases,
     scientists might one day apply these methods to manipulate other genetic traits not perceived as desirable. This
     raises questions such as:

         · Which genetic traits are worthy of being "corrected"?
         · Should gene therapy be used for cosmetic reasons or to enhance human abilities?

    · Should genetic manipulation be used to impart desirable traits to the unborn?
    · Is everyone entitled to gene therapy, or could the cost of gene therapy create new forms of social inequality?
    · Who should be responsible for regulating and policing inappropriate use of gene therapies?

The ability to alter reproductive cells using gene therapy could also generate new ethical dilemmas. To date, the
various types of gene therapies have been targeted to somatic cells, the non-reproductive cells within the body.
Because somatic cell traits are not inherited, any genetic changes accomplished by somatic-cell gene therapy would
not be passed on to offspring. However, should scientists successfully introduce new genes to germ cells (eggs or
sperm), the resulting traits could be passed on to offspring. This approach, called germ-line gene therapy, could
potentially be used to combat heritable diseases, but it could also lead to unintended consequences for future
generations. Moreover, there is the question of informed consent, because those impacted by germ-line gene
therapy are unborn and therefore unable to choose whether they receive the therapy. For these reasons, the U.S.
government does not currently fund research projects investigating germ-line gene therapies in humans.

  EYE ON ETHICS

  Risky Gene Therapies

  While there are currently no gene therapies on the market in the United States, many are in the pipeline and it is
  likely that some will eventually be approved. With recent advances in gene therapies targeting p53, a gene
  whose somatic cell mutations have been implicated in over 50% of human cancers,12 cancer treatments
  through gene therapies could become much more widespread once they reach the commercial market.

  Bringing any new therapy to market poses ethical questions that pit the expected benefits against the risks. How
  quickly should new therapies be brought to the market? How can we ensure that new therapies have been
  sufficiently tested for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed to the public? The process by which
  new therapies are developed and approved complicates such questions, as those involved in the approval
  process are often under significant pressure to get a new therapy approved even in the face of significant risks.

  To receive FDA approval for a new therapy, researchers must collect significant laboratory data from animal
  trials and submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and
  Research (CDER). Following a 30-day waiting period during which the FDA reviews the IND, clinical trials
  involving human subjects may begin. If the FDA perceives a problem prior to or during the clinical trial, the FDA
  can order a "clinical hold" until any problems are addressed. During clinical trials, researchers collect and
  analyze data on the therapy's effectiveness and safety, including any side effects observed. Once the therapy
  meets FDA standards for effectiveness and safety, the developers can submit a New Drug Application (NDA) that
  details how the therapy will be manufactured, packaged, monitored, and administered.

  Because new gene therapies are frequently the result of many years (even decades) of laboratory and clinical
  research, they require a significant financial investment. By the time a therapy has reached the clinical trials
  stage, the financial stakes are high for pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders. This creates potential
  conflicts of interest that can sometimes affect the objective judgment of researchers, their funders, and even
  trial participants. The Jesse Gelsinger case (see Case in Point: Gene Therapy Gone Wrong) is a classic example.
  Faced with a life-threatening disease and no reasonable treatments available, it is easy to see why a patient
  might be eager to participate in a clinical trial no matter the risks. It is also easy to see how a researcher might
  view the short-term risks for a small group of study participants as a small price to pay for the potential benefits
  of a game-changing new treatment.

  Gelsinger's death led to increased scrutiny of gene therapy, and subsequent negative outcomes of gene therapy
  have resulted in the temporary halting of clinical trials pending further investigation. For example, when children
  in France treated with gene therapy for SCID began to develop leukemia several years after treatment, the FDA
  temporarily stopped clinical trials of similar types of gene therapy occurring in the United States.13 Cases like
  these highlight the need for researchers and health professionals not only to value human well-being and
  patients' rights over profitability, but also to maintain scientific objectivity when evaluating the risks and benefits
  of new therapies.

number of microbial colony-forming units (CFUs) present. The center console harbored by far the most microbes (506 CFUs), possibly
because that is where drinks are placed (and often spilled). Frequently touched sites also had high concentrations. (credit "photo":

INTRODUCTION How clean is clean? People wash their cars and vacuum the carpets, but most would not want to
eat from these surfaces. Similarly, we might eat with silverware cleaned in a dishwasher, but we could not use the
same dishwasher to clean surgical instruments. As these examples illustrate, "clean" is a relative term. Car washing,
vacuuming, and dishwashing all reduce the microbial load on the items treated, thus making them "cleaner." But
whether they are "clean enough" depends on their intended use. Because people do not normally eat from cars or
carpets, these items do not require the same level of cleanliness that silverware does. Likewise, because silverware
is not used for invasive surgery, these utensils do not require the same level of cleanliness as surgical equipment,
which requires sterilization to prevent infection.
Why not play it safe and sterilize everything? Sterilizing everything we come in contact with is impractical, as well as
potentially dangerous. As this chapter will demonstrate, sterilization protocols often require time- and labor-
intensive treatments that may degrade the quality of the item being treated or have toxic effects on users.
Therefore, the user must consider the item's intended application when choosing a cleaning method to ensure that
it is "clean enough."

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Roberta is a 46-year-old real estate agent who recently underwent a cholecystectomy (surgery to remove
       painful gallstones). The surgery was performed laparoscopically with the aid of a duodenoscope, a specialized
       endoscope that allows surgeons to see inside the body with the aid of a tiny camera. On returning home from the
       hospital, Roberta developed abdominal pain and a high fever. She also experienced a burning sensation during
       urination and noticed blood in her urine. She notified her surgeon of these symptoms, per her postoperative
       instructions.

     To prevent the spread of human disease, it is necessary to control the growth and abundance of microbes in or on
     various items frequently used by humans. Inanimate items, such as doorknobs, toys, or towels, which may harbor
     microbes and aid in disease transmission, are called fomites. Two factors heavily influence the level of cleanliness
     required for a particular fomite and, hence, the protocol chosen to achieve this level. The first factor is the
     application for which the item will be used. For example, invasive applications that require insertion into the human
     body require a much higher level of cleanliness than applications that do not. The second factor is the level of
     resistance to antimicrobial treatment by potential pathogens. For example, foods preserved by canning often
     become contaminated with the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which produces the neurotoxin that causes
     botulism. Because C. botulinum can produce endospores that can survive harsh conditions, extreme temperatures
     and pressures must be used to eliminate the endospores. Other organisms may not require such extreme measures
     and can be controlled by a procedure such as washing clothes in a laundry machine.

     Laboratory Biological Safety Levels

     For researchers or laboratory personnel working with pathogens, the risks associated with specific pathogens
     determine the levels of cleanliness and control required. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
     the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have established four classification levels, called "biological safety levels"
     (BSLs). Various organizations around the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European
     Union (EU), use a similar classification scheme. According to the CDC, the BSL is determined by the agent's
     infectivity, ease of transmission, and potential disease severity, as well as the type of work being done with the
     agent.2

     Each BSL requires a different level of biocontainment to prevent contamination and spread of infectious agents to
     laboratory personnel and, ultimately, the community. For example, the lowest BSL, BSL-1, requires the fewest
     precautions because it applies to situations with the lowest risk for microbial infection.

     BSL-1 agents are those that generally do not cause infection in healthy human adults. These include noninfectious
     bacteria, such as nonpathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and viruses known to infect animals
     other than humans, such as baculoviruses (insect viruses). Because working with BSL-1 agents poses very little risk,
     few precautions are necessary. Laboratory workers use standard aseptic technique and may work with these agents

at an open laboratory bench or table, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a laboratory coat,
goggles, and gloves, as needed. Other than a sink for handwashing and doors to separate the laboratory from the
rest of the building, no additional modifications are needed.

Agents classified as BSL-2 include those that pose moderate risk to laboratory workers and the community, and are
typically "indigenous," meaning that they are commonly found in that geographical area. These include bacteria
such as Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp., and viruses like hepatitis, mumps, and measles viruses. BSL-2
laboratories require additional precautions beyond those of BSL-1, including restricted access; required PPE,
including a face shield in some circumstances; and the use of biological safety cabinets for procedures that may
disperse agents through the air (called "aerosolization"). BSL-2 laboratories are equipped with self-closing doors, an
eyewash station, and an autoclave, which is a specialized device for sterilizing materials with pressurized steam
before use or disposal. BSL-1 laboratories may also have an autoclave.

BSL-3 agents have the potential to cause lethal infections by inhalation. These may be either indigenous or "exotic,"
meaning that they are derived from a foreign location, and include pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Bacillus anthracis, West Nile virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because of the serious nature of the
infections caused by BSL-3 agents, laboratories working with them require restricted access. Laboratory workers are
under medical surveillance, possibly receiving vaccinations for the microbes with which they work. In addition to the
standard PPE already mentioned, laboratory personnel in BSL-3 laboratories must also wear a respirator and work
with microbes and infectious agents in a biological safety cabinet at all times. BSL-3 laboratories require a hands-
free sink, an eyewash station near the exit, and two sets of self-closing and locking doors at the entrance. These
laboratories are equipped with directional airflow, meaning that clean air is pulled through the laboratory from clean
areas to potentially contaminated areas. This air cannot be recirculated, so a constant supply of clean air is required.

BSL-4 agents are the most dangerous and often fatal. These microbes are typically exotic, are easily transmitted by
inhalation, and cause infections for which there are no treatments or vaccinations. Examples include Ebola virus and
Marburg virus, both of which cause hemorrhagic fevers, and smallpox virus. There are only a small number of
laboratories in the United States and around the world appropriately equipped to work with these agents. In
addition to BSL-3 precautions, laboratory workers in BSL-4 facilities must also change their clothing on entering the
laboratory, shower on exiting, and decontaminate all material on exiting. While working in the laboratory, they must
either wear a full-body protective suit with a designated air supply or conduct all work within a biological safety
cabinet with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air supply and a doubly HEPA-filtered exhaust. If
wearing a suit, the air pressure within the suit must be higher than that outside the suit, so that if a leak in the suit
occurs, laboratory air that may be contaminated cannot be drawn into the suit (Figure 13.2). The laboratory itself
must be located either in a separate building or in an isolated portion of a building and have its own air supply and
exhaust system, as well as its own decontamination system. The BSLs are summarized in Figure 13.3.

     laboratory. (Credit: James Gathany, CDC, public domain)

Sterilization

The most extreme protocols for microbial control aim to achieve sterilization: the complete removal or killing of all
vegetative cells, endospores, and viruses from the targeted item or environment. Sterilization protocols are
generally reserved for laboratory, medical, manufacturing, and food industry settings, where it may be imperative
for certain items to be completely free of potentially infectious agents. Sterilization can be accomplished through
either physical means, such as exposure to high heat, pressure, or filtration through an appropriate filter, or by
chemical means. Chemicals that can be used to achieve sterilization are called sterilants. Sterilants effectively kill
all microbes and viruses, and, with appropriate exposure time, can also kill endospores.

For many clinical purposes, aseptic technique is necessary to prevent contamination of sterile surfaces. Aseptic
technique involves a combination of protocols that collectively maintain sterility, or asepsis, thus preventing
contamination of the patient with microbes and infectious agents. Failure to practice aseptic technique during many
types of clinical procedures may introduce microbes to the patient's body and put the patient at risk for sepsis, a
systemic inflammatory response to an infection that results in high fever, increased heart and respiratory rates,
shock, and, possibly, death. Medical procedures that carry risk of contamination must be performed in a sterile
field, a designated area that is kept free of all vegetative microbes, endospores, and viruses. Sterile fields are
created according to protocols requiring the use of sterilized materials, such as packaging and drapings, and strict
procedures for washing and application of sterilants. Other protocols are followed to maintain the sterile field while
the medical procedure is being performed.

One food sterilization protocol, commercial sterilization, uses heat at a temperature low enough to preserve food
quality but high enough to destroy common pathogens responsible for food poisoning, such as C. botulinum.
Because C. botulinum and its endospores are commonly found in soil, they may easily contaminate crops during
harvesting, and these endospores can later germinate within the anaerobic environment once foods are canned.
Metal cans of food contaminated with C. botulinum will bulge due to the microbe's production of gases;
contaminated jars of food typically bulge at the metal lid. To eliminate the risk for C. botulinum contamination,
commercial food-canning protocols are designed with a large margin of error. They assume an impossibly large
population of endospores (1012 per can) and aim to reduce this population to 1 endospore per can to ensure the
safety of canned foods. For example, low- and medium-acid foods are heated to 121 °C for a minimum of 2.52
minutes, which is the time it would take to reduce a population of 1012 endospores per can down to 1 endospore at
this temperature. Even so, commercial sterilization does not eliminate the presence of all microbes; rather, it targets
those pathogens that cause spoilage and foodborne diseases, while allowing many nonpathogenic organisms to
survive. Therefore, "sterilization" is somewhat of a misnomer in this context, and commercial sterilization may be
more accurately described as "quasi-sterilization."

     Other Methods of Control

     Sterilization protocols require procedures that are not practical, or necessary, in many settings. Various other
     methods are used in clinical and nonclinical settings to reduce the microbial load on items. Although the terms for
     these methods are often used interchangeably, there are important distinctions (Figure 13.4).

     The process of disinfection inactivates most microbes on the surface of a fomite by using antimicrobial chemicals or
     heat. Because some microbes remain, the disinfected item is not considered sterile. Ideally, disinfectants should
     be fast acting, stable, easy to prepare, inexpensive, and easy to use. An example of a natural disinfectant is vinegar;
     its acidity kills most microbes. Chemical disinfectants, such as chlorine bleach or products containing chlorine, are
     used to clean nonliving surfaces such as laboratory benches, clinical surfaces, and bathroom sinks. Typical
     disinfection does not lead to sterilization because endospores tend to survive even when all vegetative cells have
     been killed.

     Unlike disinfectants, antiseptics are antimicrobial chemicals safe for use on living skin or tissues. Examples of
     antiseptics include hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol. The process of applying an antiseptic is called
     antisepsis. In addition to the characteristics of a good disinfectant, antiseptics must also be selectively effective
     against microorganisms and able to penetrate tissue deeply without causing tissue damage.

     The type of protocol required to achieve the desired level of cleanliness depends on the particular item to be
     cleaned. For example, those used clinically are categorized as critical, semicritical, and noncritical. Critical items
     must be sterile because they will be used inside the body, often penetrating sterile tissues or the bloodstream;
     examples of critical items include surgical instruments, catheters, and intravenous fluids. Gastrointestinal
     endoscopes and various types of equipment for respiratory therapies are examples of semicritical items; they may
     contact mucous membranes or nonintact skin but do not penetrate tissues. Semicritical items do not typically need
     to be sterilized but do require a high level of disinfection. Items that may contact but not penetrate intact skin are
     noncritical items; examples are bed linens, furniture, crutches, stethoscopes, and blood pressure cuffs. These
     articles need to be clean but not highly disinfected.

     The act of handwashing is an example of degerming, in which microbial numbers are significantly reduced by gently
     scrubbing living tissue, most commonly skin, with a mild chemical (e.g., soap) to avoid the transmission of
     pathogenic microbes. Wiping the skin with an alcohol swab at an injection site is another example of degerming.
     These degerming methods remove most (but not all) microbes from the skin's surface.

     The term sanitization refers to the cleansing of fomites to remove enough microbes to achieve levels deemed safe
     for public health. For example, commercial dishwashers used in the food service industry typically use very hot
     water and air for washing and drying; the high temperatures kill most microbes, sanitizing the dishes. Surfaces in
     hospital rooms are commonly sanitized using a chemical disinfectant to prevent disease transmission between
     patients. Figure 13.4 summarizes common protocols, definitions, applications, and agents used to control microbial
     growth.

CLINICAL FOCUS
Part 2

Roberta's physician suspected that a bacterial infection was responsible for her sudden-onset high fever,
abdominal pain, and bloody urine. Based on these symptoms, the physician diagnosed a urinary tract infection
(UTI). A wide variety of bacteria may cause UTIs, which typically occur when bacteria from the lower
gastrointestinal tract are introduced to the urinary tract. However, Roberta's recent gallstone surgery caused the
physician to suspect that she had contracted a nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection during her surgery. The
physician took a urine sample and ordered a urine culture to check for the presence of white blood cells, red
blood cells, and bacteria. The results of this test would help determine the cause of the infection. The physician
also prescribed a course of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, confident that it would clear Roberta's infection.

     Measuring Microbial Control

     Physical and chemical methods of microbial control that kill the targeted microorganism are identified by the suffix
     -cide (or -cidal). The prefix indicates the type of microbe or infectious agent killed by the treatment method:
     bactericides kill bacteria, viricides kill or inactivate viruses, and fungicides kill fungi. Other methods do not kill
     organisms but, instead, stop their growth, making their population static; such methods are identified by the suffix
     -stat (or -static). For example, bacteriostatic treatments inhibit the growth of bacteria, whereas fungistatic
     treatments inhibit the growth of fungi. Factors that determine whether a particular treatment is -cidal or -static
     include the types of microorganisms targeted, the concentration of the chemical used, and the nature of the
     treatment applied.

     Although -static treatments do not actually kill infectious agents, they are often less toxic to humans and other
     animals, and may also better preserve the integrity of the item treated. Such treatments are typically sufficient to
     keep the microbial population of an item in check. The reduced toxicity of some of these -static chemicals also
     allows them to be impregnated safely into plastics to prevent the growth of microbes on these surfaces. Such
     plastics are used in products such as toys for children and cutting boards for food preparation. When used to treat
     an infection, -static treatments are typically sufficient in an otherwise healthy individual, preventing the pathogen
     from multiplying, thus allowing the individual's immune system to clear the infection.

     The degree of microbial control can be evaluated using a microbial death curve to describe the progress and
     effectiveness of a particular protocol. When exposed to a particular microbial control protocol, a fixed percentage of
     the microbes within the population will die. Because the rate of killing remains constant even when the population
     size varies, the percentage killed is more useful information than the absolute number of microbes killed. Death
     curves are often plotted as semilog plots just like microbial growth curves because the reduction in microorganisms
     is typically logarithmic (Figure 13.5). The amount of time it takes for a specific protocol to produce a one order-of-
     magnitude decrease in the number of organisms, or the death of 90% of the population, is called the decimal
     reduction time (DRT) or D-value.

     FIGURE 13.5 Microbial death is logarithmic and easily observed using a semilog plot instead of an arithmetic one. The decimal reduction
     time (D-value) is the time it takes to kill 90% of the population (a 1-log decrease in the total population) when exposed to a specific
     microbial control protocol, as indicated by the purple bracket.

     Several factors contribute to the effectiveness of a disinfecting agent or microbial control protocol. First, as
     demonstrated in Figure 13.5, the length of time of exposure is important. Longer exposure times kill more microbes.
     Because microbial death of a population exposed to a specific protocol is logarithmic, it takes longer to kill a high-
     population load than a low-population load exposed to the same protocol. A shorter treatment time (measured in
     multiples of the D-value) is needed when starting with a smaller number of organisms. Effectiveness also depends
     on the susceptibility of the agent to that disinfecting agent or protocol. The concentration of disinfecting agent or

intensity of exposure is also important. For example, higher temperatures and higher concentrations of disinfectants
kill microbes more quickly and effectively. Conditions that limit contact between the agent and the targeted cells
cells--for example, the presence of bodily fluids, tissue, organic debris (e.g., mud or feces), or biofilms on
surfaces--increase the cleaning time or intensity of the microbial control protocol required to reach the desired level
of cleanliness. All these factors must be considered when choosing the appropriate protocol to control microbial
growth in a given situation.

13.2 Using Physical Methods to Control Microorganisms

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Understand and compare various physical methods of controlling microbial growth, including heating,
        refrigeration, freezing, high-pressure treatment, desiccation, lyophilization, irradiation, and filtration

For thousands of years, humans have used various physical methods of microbial control for food preservation.
Common control methods include the application of high temperatures, radiation, filtration, and desiccation
(drying), among others. Many of these methods nonspecifically kill cells by disrupting membranes, changing
membrane permeability, or damaging proteins and nucleic acids by denaturation, degradation, or chemical
modification. Various physical methods used for microbial control are described in this section.

Heat

Heating is one of the most common--and oldest--forms of microbial control. It is used in simple techniques like
cooking and canning. Heat can kill microbes by altering their membranes and denaturing proteins. The thermal
death point (TDP) of a microorganism is the lowest temperature at which all microbes are killed in a 10-minute
exposure. Different microorganisms will respond differently to high temperatures, with some (e.g., endospore-
formers such as C. botulinum) being more heat tolerant. A similar parameter, the thermal death time (TDT), is the
length of time needed to kill all microorganisms in a sample at a given temperature. These parameters are often
used to describe sterilization procedures that use high heat, such as autoclaving. Boiling is one of the oldest
methods of moist-heat control of microbes, and it is typically quite effective at killing vegetative cells and some
viruses. However, boiling is less effective at killing endospores; some endospores are able to survive up to 20 hours
of boiling. Additionally, boiling may be less effective at higher altitudes, where the boiling point of water is lower and
the boiling time needed to kill microbes is therefore longer. For these reasons, boiling is not considered a useful
sterilization technique in the laboratory or clinical setting.

Many different heating protocols can be used for sterilization in the laboratory or clinic, and these protocols can be
broken down into two main categories: dry-heat sterilization and moist-heat sterilization. Aseptic technique in the
laboratory typically involves some dry-heat sterilization protocols using direct application of high heat, such as
sterilizing inoculating loops (Figure 13.6). Incineration at very high temperatures destroys all microorganisms. Dry
heat can also be applied for relatively long periods of time (at least 2 hours) at temperatures up to 170 °C by using a
dry-heat sterilizer, such as an oven. However, moist-heat sterilization is typically the more effective protocol
because it penetrates cells better than dry heat does.
502  13 · Control of Microbial Growth

     FIGURE 13.6 (a) Sterilizing a loop, often referred to as "flaming a loop," is a common component of aseptic technique in the microbiology
     laboratory and is used to incinerate any microorganisms on the loop. (b) Alternatively, a bactericinerator may be used to reduce
     aerosolization of microbes and remove the presence of an open flame in the laboratory. These are examples of dry-heat sterilization by the
     direct application of high heat capable of incineration. (credit a: modification of work by Anh-Hue Tu; credit b: modification of work by Brian
     Forster)

     Autoclaves
     Autoclaves rely on moist-heat sterilization. They are used to raise temperatures above the boiling point of water to
     sterilize items such as surgical equipment from vegetative cells, viruses, and especially endospores, which are
     known to survive boiling temperatures, without damaging the items. Charles Chamberland (1851-1908) designed
     the modern autoclave in 1879 while working in the laboratory of Louis Pasteur. The autoclave is still considered the
     most effective method of sterilization (Figure 13.7). Outside laboratory and clinical settings, large industrial
     autoclaves called retorts allow for moist-heat sterilization on a large scale.
     In general, the air in the chamber of an autoclave is removed and replaced with increasing amounts of steam
     trapped within the enclosed chamber, resulting in increased interior pressure and temperatures above the boiling
     point of water. The two main types of autoclaves differ in the way that air is removed from the chamber. In gravity
     displacement autoclaves, steam is introduced into the chamber from the top or sides. Air, which is heavier than
     steam, sinks to the bottom of the chamber, where it is forced out through a vent. Complete displacement of air is
     difficult, especially in larger loads, so longer cycles may be required for such loads. In prevacuum sterilizers, air is
     removed completely using a high-speed vacuum before introducing steam into the chamber. Because air is more
     completely eliminated, the steam can more easily penetrate wrapped items. Many autoclaves are capable of both
     gravity and prevacuum cycles, using the former for the decontamination of waste and sterilization of media and
     unwrapped glassware, and the latter for sterilization of packaged instruments.

                  FIGURE 13.7 A technician sterilizes a sample using an autoclave. (Credit: Martha Cooper / Picryl; Public Domain.

Standard operating temperatures for autoclaves are 121 °C or, in some cases, 132 °C, typically at a pressure of 15
to 20 pounds per square inch (psi). The length of exposure depends on the volume and nature of material being
sterilized, but it is typically 20 minutes or more, with larger volumes requiring longer exposure times to ensure
sufficient heat transfer to the materials being sterilized. The steam must directly contact the liquids or dry materials
being sterilized, so containers are left loosely closed and instruments are loosely wrapped in paper or foil. The key
to autoclaving is that the temperature must be high enough to kill endospores to achieve complete sterilization.

Because sterilization is so important to safe medical and laboratory protocols, quality control is essential.
Autoclaves may be equipped with recorders to document the pressures and temperatures achieved during each run.
Additionally, internal indicators of various types should be autoclaved along with the materials to be sterilized to
ensure that the proper sterilization temperature has been reached (Figure 13.8). One common type of indicator is
the use of heat-sensitive autoclave tape, which has white stripes that turn black when the appropriate temperature
is achieved during a successful autoclave run. This type of indicator is relatively inexpensive and can be used during
every run. However, autoclave tape provides no indication of length of exposure, so it cannot be used as an indicator
of sterility. Another type of indicator, a biological indicator spore test, uses either a strip of paper or a liquid
suspension of the endospores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus to determine whether the endospores are killed by
the process. The endospores of the obligate thermophilic bacterium G. stearothermophilus are the gold standard
used for this purpose because of their extreme heat resistance. Biological spore indicators can also be used to test
the effectiveness of other sterilization protocols, including ethylene oxide, dry heat, formaldehyde, gamma radiation,
and hydrogen peroxide plasma sterilization using either G. stearothermophilus, Bacillus atrophaeus, B. subtilis, or B.
pumilus spores. In the case of validating autoclave function, the endospores are incubated after autoclaving to
ensure no viable endospores remain. Bacterial growth subsequent to endospore germination can be monitored by
biological indicator spore tests that detect acid metabolites or fluorescence produced by enzymes derived from
viable G. stearothermophilus. A third type of autoclave indicator is the Diack tube, a glass ampule containing a
temperature-sensitive pellet that melts at the proper sterilization temperature. Spore strips or Diack tubes are used
periodically to ensure the autoclave is functioning properly.

     work by Brian Forster)

     Pasteurization
     Although complete sterilization is ideal for many medical applications, it is not always practical for other
     applications and may also alter the quality of the product. Boiling and autoclaving are not ideal ways to control
     microbial growth in many foods because these methods may ruin the consistency and other organoleptic (sensory)
     qualities of the food. Pasteurization is a form of microbial control for food that uses heat but does not render the
     food sterile. Traditional pasteurization kills pathogens and reduces the number of spoilage-causing microbes while
     maintaining food quality. The process of pasteurization was first developed by Louis Pasteur in the 1860s as a
     method for preventing the spoilage of beer and wine. Today, pasteurization is most commonly used to kill heat-
     sensitive pathogens in milk and other food products (e.g., apple juice and honey) (Figure 13.9). However, because
     pasteurized food products are not sterile, they will eventually spoil.
     The methods used for milk pasteurization balance the temperature and the length of time of treatment. One
     method, high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization, exposes milk to a temperature of 72 °C for 15
     seconds, which lowers bacterial numbers while preserving the quality of the milk. An alternative is ultra-high-
     temperature (UHT) pasteurization, in which the milk is exposed to a temperature of 138 °C for 2 or more seconds.
     UHT pasteurized milk can be stored for a long time in sealed containers without being refrigerated; however, the
     very high temperatures alter the proteins in the milk, causing slight changes in the taste and smell. Still, this method
     of pasteurization is advantageous in regions where access to refrigeration is limited.

Refrigeration and Freezing

Just as high temperatures are effective for controlling microbial growth, exposing microbes to low temperatures can
also be an easy and effective method of microbial control, with the exception of psychrophiles, which prefer cold
temperatures (see Temperature and Microbial Growth). Refrigerators used in home kitchens or in the laboratory
maintain temperatures between 0 °C and 7 °C. This temperature range inhibits microbial metabolism, slowing the
growth of microorganisms significantly and helping preserve refrigerated products such as foods or medical
supplies. Certain types of laboratory cultures can be preserved by refrigeration for later use.
Freezing below -2 °C may stop microbial growth and even kill susceptible organisms. According to the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA), the only safe ways that frozen foods can be thawed are in the refrigerator,
immersed in cold water changed every 30 minutes, or in the microwave, keeping the food at temperatures not
conducive for bacterial growth.3 In addition, halted bacterial growth can restart in thawed foods, so thawed foods
should be treated like fresh perishables.
Bacterial cultures and medical specimens requiring long-term storage or transport are often frozen at ultra-low
temperatures of -70 °C or lower. These ultra-low temperatures can be achieved by storing specimens on dry ice in
an ultra-low freezer or in special liquid nitrogen tanks, which maintain temperatures lower than -196 °C (Figure
13.10).

         · Does placing food in a refrigerator kill bacteria on the food?

     Pressure

     Exposure to high pressure kills many microbes. In the food industry, high-pressure processing (also called
     pascalization) is used to kill bacteria, yeast, molds, parasites, and viruses in foods while maintaining food quality
     and extending shelf life. The application of high pressure between 100 and 800 MPa (sea level atmospheric
     pressure is about 0.1 MPa) is sufficient to kill vegetative cells by protein denaturation, but endospores may survive
     these pressures.4 5

     In clinical settings, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is sometimes used to treat infections. In this form of therapy, a
     patient breathes pure oxygen at a pressure higher than normal atmospheric pressure, typically between 1 and 3
     atmospheres (atm). This is achieved by placing the patient in a hyperbaric chamber or by supplying the pressurized
     oxygen through a breathing tube. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy helps increase oxygen saturation in tissues that
     become hypoxic due to infection and inflammation. This increased oxygen concentration enhances the body's
     immune response by increasing the activities of neutrophils and macrophages, white blood cells that fight
     infections. Increased oxygen levels also contribute to the formation of toxic free radicals that inhibit the growth of
     oxygen-sensitive or anaerobic bacteria like as Clostridium perfringens, a common cause of gas gangrene. In C.
     perfringens infections, hyperbaric oxygen therapy can also reduce secretion of a bacterial toxin that causes tissue
     destruction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy also seems to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotic treatments.
     Unfortunately, some rare risks include oxygen toxicity and effects on delicate tissues, such as the eyes, middle ear,
     and lungs, which may be damaged by the increased air pressure.

     High pressure processing is not commonly used for disinfection or sterilization of fomites. Although the application
     of pressure and steam in an autoclave is effective for killing endospores, it is the high temperature achieved, and not
     the pressure directly, that results in endospore death.

and drooping eyelids. She was rushed to the emergency department of her local hospital. During the
examination, she began to experience abdominal cramping, nausea, paralysis, dry mouth, weakness of facial
muscles, and difficulty speaking and breathing. Based on these symptoms, the hospital's incident command
center was activated, and Ohio public health officials were notified of a possible case of botulism. Meanwhile,
other patients with similar symptoms began showing up at other local hospitals. Because of the suspicion of
botulism, antitoxin was shipped overnight from the CDC to these medical facilities, to be administered to the
affected patients. The first patient died of respiratory failure as a result of paralysis, and about half of the
remaining victims required additional hospitalization following antitoxin administration, with at least two
requiring ventilators for breathing.

Public health officials investigated each of the cases and determined that all of the patients had attended the
same church potluck the day before. Moreover, they traced the source of the outbreak to a potato salad made
with home-canned potatoes. More than likely, the potatoes were canned using boiling water, a method that
allows endospores of Clostridium botulinum to survive. C. botulinum produces botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin
that is often deadly once ingested. According to the CDC, the Ohio case was the largest botulism outbreak in the
United States in nearly 40 years.6

Killing C. botulinum endospores requires a minimum temperature of 116 °C (240 °F), well above the boiling
point of water. This temperature can only be reached in a pressure canner, which is recommended for home
canning of low-acid foods such as meat, fish, poultry, and vegetables (Figure 13.11). Additionally, the CDC
recommends boiling home-canned foods for about 10 minutes before consumption. Since the botulinum toxin is
heat labile (meaning that it is denatured by heat), 10 minutes of boiling will render nonfunctional any botulinum
toxin that the food may contain.

   FIGURE 13.11 (a) Clostridium botulinum is the causative agent of botulism. (b) A pressure canner is recommended for home canning

     Desiccation

     Drying, also known as desiccation or dehydration, is a method that has been used for millennia to preserve foods
     such as raisins, prunes, and jerky. It works because all cells, including microbes, require water for their metabolism
     and survival. Although drying controls microbial growth, it might not kill all microbes or their endospores, which may
     start to regrow when conditions are more favorable and water content is restored.

     In some cases, foods are dried in the sun, relying on evaporation to achieve desiccation. Freeze-drying, or
     lyophilization, is another method of dessication in which an item is rapidly frozen ("snap-frozen") and placed under
     vacuum so that water is lost by sublimation. Lyophilization combines both exposure to cold temperatures and
     desiccation, making it quite effective for controlling microbial growth. In addition, lyophilization causes less damage
     to an item than conventional desiccation and better preserves the item's original qualities. Lyophilized items may be
     stored at room temperature if packaged appropriately to prevent moisture acquisition. Lyophilization is used for
     preservation in the food industry and is also used in the laboratory for the long-term storage and transportation of
     microbial cultures.

     The water content of foods and materials, called the water activity, can be lowered without physical drying by the
     addition of solutes such as salts or sugars. At very high concentrations of salts or sugars, the amount of available
     water in microbial cells is reduced dramatically because water will be drawn from an area of low solute
     concentration (inside the cell) to an area of high solute concentration (outside the cell) (Figure 13.12). Many
     microorganisms do not survive these conditions of high osmotic pressure. Honey, for example, is 80% sucrose, an
     environment in which very few microorganisms are capable of growing, thereby eliminating the need for
     refrigeration. Salted meats and fish, like ham and cod, respectively, were critically important foods before the age of
     refrigeration. Fruits were preserved by adding sugar, making jams and jellies. However, certain microbes, such as
     molds and yeasts, tend to be more tolerant of desiccation and high osmotic pressures, and, thus, may still
     contaminate these types of foods.

     FIGURE 13.12 (a) The addition of a solute creates a hypertonic environment, drawing water out of cells. (b) Some foods can be dried
     directly, like raisins and jerky. Other foods are dried with the addition of salt, as in the case of salted fish, or sugar, as in the case of jam.

     Radiation

     Radiation in various forms, from high-energy radiation to sunlight, can be used to kill microbes or inhibit their
     growth. Ionizing radiation includes X-rays, gamma rays, and high-energy electron beams. Ionizing radiation is
     strong enough to pass into the cell, where it alters molecular structures and damages cell components. For
     example, ionizing radiation introduces double-strand breaks in DNA molecules. This may directly cause DNA
     mutations to occur, or mutations may be introduced when the cell attempts to repair the DNA damage. As these

mutations accumulate, they eventually lead to cell death.

Both X-rays and gamma rays easily penetrate paper and plastic and can therefore be used to sterilize many
packaged materials. In the laboratory, ionizing radiation is commonly used to sterilize materials that cannot be
autoclaved, such as plastic Petri dishes and disposable plastic inoculating loops. For clinical use, ionizing radiation is
used to sterilize gloves, intravenous tubing, and other latex and plastic items used for patient care. Ionizing radiation
is also used for the sterilization of other types of delicate, heat-sensitive materials used clinically, including tissues
for transplantation, pharmaceutical drugs, and medical equipment.

In Europe, gamma irradiation for food preservation is widely used, although it has been slow to catch on in the
United States (see the Micro Connections box on this topic). Packaged dried spices are also often gamma-irradiated.
Because of their ability to penetrate paper, plastic, thin sheets of wood and metal, and tissue, great care must be
taken when using X-rays and gamma irradiation. These types of ionizing irradiation cannot penetrate thick layers of
iron or lead, so these metals are commonly used to protect humans who may be potentially exposed.

Another type of radiation, nonionizing radiation, is commonly used for disinfection and uses less energy than
ionizing radiation. It does not penetrate cells or packaging. Ultraviolet (UV) light is one example; it causes thymine
dimers to form between adjacent thymines within a single strand of DNA (Figure 13.13). When DNA polymerase
encounters the thymine dimer, it does not always incorporate the appropriate complementary nucleotides (two
adenines), and this leads to formation of mutations that can ultimately kill microorganisms.

UV light can be used effectively by both consumers and laboratory personnel to control microbial growth. UV lamps
are now commonly incorporated into water purification systems for use in homes. In addition, small portable UV
lights are commonly used by campers to purify water from natural environments before drinking. Germicidal lamps
are also used in surgical suites, biological safety cabinets, and transfer hoods, typically emitting UV light at a
wavelength of 260 nm. Because UV light does not penetrate surfaces and will not pass through plastics or glass,
cells must be exposed directly to the light source.

Sunlight has a very broad spectrum that includes UV and visible light. In some cases, sunlight can be effective
against certain bacteria because of both the formation of thymine dimers by UV light and by the production of
reactive oxygen products induced in low amounts by exposure to visible light.

     Irradiated Food: Would You Eat That?

     Of all the ways to prevent food spoilage and foodborne illness, gamma irradiation may be the most unappetizing.
     Although gamma irradiation is a proven method of eliminating potentially harmful microbes from food, the public
     has yet to buy in. Most of their concerns, however, stem from misinformation and a poor understanding of the basic
     principles of radiation.

     The most common method of irradiation is to expose food to cobalt-60 or cesium-137 by passing it through a
     radiation chamber on a conveyor belt. The food does not directly contact the radioactive material and does not
     become radioactive itself. Thus, there is no risk for exposure to radioactive material through eating gamma-
     irradiated foods. Additionally, irradiated foods are not significantly altered in terms of nutritional quality, aside from
     the loss of certain vitamins, which is also exacerbated by extended storage. Alterations in taste or smell may occur
     in irradiated foods with high fat content, such as fatty meats and dairy products, but this effect can be minimized by
     using lower doses of radiation at colder temperatures.

     In the United States, the CDC, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
     have deemed irradiation safe and effective for various types of meats, poultry, shellfish, fresh fruits and vegetables,
     eggs with shells, and spices and seasonings. Gamma irradiation of foods has also been approved for use in many
     other countries, including France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Israel, Russia, China, Thailand, Belgium, Australia, and
     South Africa. To help ameliorate consumer concern and assist with education efforts, irradiated foods are now
     clearly labeled and marked with the international irradiation symbol, called the "radura" (Figure 13.14). Consumer
     acceptance seems to be rising, as indicated by several recent studies.7

     Sonication

     The use of high-frequency ultrasound waves to disrupt cell structures is called sonication. Application of ultrasound
     waves causes rapid changes in pressure within the intracellular liquid; this leads to cavitation, the formation of
     bubbles inside the cell, which can disrupt cell structures and eventually cause the cell to lyse or collapse. Sonication
     is useful in the laboratory for efficiently lysing cells to release their contents for further research; outside the
     laboratory, sonication is used for cleaning surgical instruments, lenses, and a variety of other objects such as coins,
     tools, and musical instruments.

     Filtration

     Filtration is a method of physically separating microbes from samples. Air is commonly filtered through high-
     efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters (Figure 13.15). HEPA filters have effective pore sizes of 0.3 µm, small

enough to capture bacterial cells, endospores, and many viruses, as air passes through these filters, nearly
sterilizing the air on the other side of the filter. HEPA filters have a variety of applications and are used widely in
clinical settings, in cars and airplanes, and even in the home. For example, they may be found in vacuum cleaners,
heating and air-conditioning systems, and air purifiers.

Biological Safety Cabinets
Biological safety cabinets are a good example of the use of HEPA filters. HEPA filters in biological safety cabinets
(BSCs) are used to remove particulates in the air either entering the cabinet (air intake), leaving the cabinet (air
exhaust), or treating both the intake and exhaust. Use of an air-intake HEPA filter prevents environmental
contaminants from entering the BSC, creating a clean area for handling biological materials. Use of an air-exhaust
HEPA filter prevents laboratory pathogens from contaminating the laboratory, thus maintaining a safe work area for
laboratory personnel.

There are three classes of BSCs: I, II, and III. Each class is designed to provide a different level of protection for
laboratory personnel and the environment; BSC II and III are also designed to protect the materials or devices in
the cabinet. Table 13.1 summarizes the level of safety provided by each class of BSC for each BSL.

512  13 · Control of Microbial Growth

     III BSCs are designed for working with highly infectious agents like those used in BSL-4 laboratories. They are gas
     tight, and materials entering or exiting the cabinet must be passed through a double-door system, allowing the
     intervening space to be decontaminated between uses. All air is passed through one or two HEPA filters and an air
     incineration system before being exhausted directly to the outdoors (not through the building's exhaust system).
     Personnel can manipulate materials inside the Class III cabinet by using long rubber gloves sealed to the cabinet.

     Filtration in Hospitals
     HEPA filters are also commonly used in hospitals and surgical suites to prevent contamination and the spread of
     airborne microbes through ventilation systems. HEPA filtration systems may be designed for entire buildings or for
     individual rooms. For example, burn units, operating rooms, or isolation units may require special HEPA-filtration
     systems to remove opportunistic pathogens from the environment because patients in these rooms are particularly
     vulnerable to infection.

     Membrane Filters
     Filtration can also be used to remove microbes from liquid samples using membrane filtration. Membrane filters for
     liquids function similarly to HEPA filters for air. Typically, membrane filters that are used to remove bacteria have an
     effective pore size of 0.2 µm, smaller than the average size of a bacterium (1 µm), but filters with smaller pore sizes
     are available for more specific needs. Membrane filtration is useful for removing bacteria from various types of heat-
     sensitive solutions used in the laboratory, such as antibiotic solutions and vitamin solutions. Large volumes of
     culture media may also be filter sterilized rather than autoclaved to protect heat-sensitive components. Often when
     filtering small volumes, syringe filters are used, but vacuum filters are typically used for filtering larger volumes
     (Figure 13.16).

     FIGURE 13.16 Membrane filters come in a variety of sizes, depending on the volume of solution being filtered. (a) Larger volumes are
     filtered in units like these. The solution is drawn through the filter by connecting the unit to a vacuum. (b) Smaller volumes are often filtered
     using syringe filters, which are units that fit on the end of a syringe. In this case, the solution is pushed through by depressing the syringe's

         · Understand and compare various chemicals used to control microbial growth, including their uses,
             advantages and disadvantages, chemical structure, and mode of action

     In addition to physical methods of microbial control, chemicals are also used to control microbial growth. A wide
     variety of chemicals can be used as disinfectants or antiseptics. When choosing which to use, it is important to
     consider the type of microbe targeted; how clean the item needs to be; the disinfectant's effect on the item's
     integrity; its safety to animals, humans, and the environment; its expense; and its ease of use. This section
     describes the variety of chemicals used as disinfectants and antiseptics, including their mechanisms of action and
     common uses.

     Phenolics

     In the 1800s, scientists began experimenting with a variety of chemicals for disinfection. In the 1860s, British
     surgeon Joseph Lister (1827-1912) began using carbolic acid, known as phenol, as a disinfectant for the treatment
     of surgical wounds (see Foundations of Modern Cell Theory). In 1879, Lister's work inspired the American chemist
     Joseph Lawrence (1836-1909) to develop Listerine, an alcohol-based mixture of several related compounds that is
     still used today as an oral antiseptic. Today, carbolic acid is no longer used as a surgical disinfectant because it is a
     skin irritant, but the chemical compounds found in antiseptic mouthwashes and throat lozenges are called
     phenolics.
     Chemically, phenol consists of a benzene ring with an -OH group, and phenolics are compounds that have this group
     as part of their chemical structure (Figure 13.19). Phenolics such as thymol and eucalyptol occur naturally in plants.
     Other phenolics can be derived from creosote, a component of coal tar. Phenolics tend to be stable, persistent on
     surfaces, and less toxic than phenol. They inhibit microbial growth by denaturing proteins and disrupting
     membranes.

as carbolic acid. (b) o-Phenylphenol, a type of phenolic, has been used as a disinfectant as well as to control bacterial and fungal growth on
harvested citrus fruits. (c) Hexachlorophene, another phenol, known as a bisphenol (two rings), is the active ingredient in pHisoHex.

Since Lister's time, several phenolic compounds have been used to control microbial growth. Phenolics like cresols
(methylated phenols) and o-phenylphenol were active ingredients in various formulations of Lysol since its invention
in 1889. o-Phenylphenol was also commonly used in agriculture to control bacterial and fungal growth on harvested
crops, especially citrus fruits, but its use in the United States is now far more limited. The bisphenol
hexachlorophene, a disinfectant, is the active ingredient in pHisoHex, a topical cleansing detergent widely used for
handwashing in hospital settings. pHisoHex is particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria, including those
causing staphylococcal and streptococcal skin infections. pHisoHex was formerly used for bathing infants, but this
practice has been discontinued because it has been shown that exposure to hexachlorophene can lead to
neurological problems.

Triclosan is another bisphenol compound that has seen widespread application in antibacterial products over the
last several decades. Initially used in toothpastes, triclosan has also been used in hand soaps and impregnated into
a wide variety of other products, including cutting boards, knives, shower curtains, clothing, and concrete, to make
them antimicrobial. However, in 2016 the FDA banned the marketing of over-the-counter antiseptic products
containing triclosan and 18 other chemicals. This ruling was based on the lack of evidence of safety or efficacy, as

Triclosan: Antibacterial Overkill?

Hand soaps and other cleaning products are often marketed as "antibacterial," suggesting that they provide a level
of cleanliness superior to that of conventional soaps and cleansers. But are the antibacterial ingredients in these
products really safe and effective?

About 75% of antibacterial liquid hand soaps and 30% of bar soaps contain the chemical triclosan, a phenolic,
(Figure 13.20).9 Triclosan blocks an enzyme in the bacterial fatty acid-biosynthesis pathway that is not found in the
comparable human pathway. Although the use of triclosan in the home increased dramatically during the 1990s,
more than 40 years of research by the FDA have turned up no conclusive evidence that washing with triclosan-
containing products provides increased health benefits compared with washing with traditional soap. Although
some studies indicate that fewer bacteria may remain on a person's hands after washing with triclosan-based soap,
compared with traditional soap, no evidence points to any reduction in the transmission of bacteria that cause
respiratory and gastrointestinal illness. In short, soaps with triclosan may remove or kill a few more germs but not
enough to reduce the spread of disease.

     Perhaps more disturbing, some clear risks associated with triclosan-based soaps have come to light. The
     widespread use of triclosan has led to an increase in triclosan-resistant bacterial strains, including those of clinical
     importance, such as Salmonella enterica; this resistance may render triclosan useless as an antibacterial in the long
     run.10 11 Bacteria can easily gain resistance to triclosan through a change to a single gene encoding the targeted
     enzyme in the bacterial fatty acid-synthesis pathway. Other disinfectants with a less specific mode of action are
     much less prone to engendering resistance because it would take much more than a single genetic change.

     Use of triclosan over the last several decades has also led to a buildup of the chemical in the environment. Triclosan
     in hand soap is directly introduced into wastewater and sewage systems as a result of the handwashing process.
     There, its antibacterial properties can inhibit or kill bacteria responsible for the decomposition of sewage, causing
     septic systems to clog and back up. Eventually, triclosan in wastewater finds its way into surface waters, streams,
     lakes, sediments, and soils, disrupting natural populations of bacteria that carry out important environmental
     functions, such as inhibiting algae. Triclosan also finds its way into the bodies of amphibians and fish, where it can
     act as an endocrine disruptor. Detectable levels of triclosan have also been found in various human bodily fluids,
     including breast milk, plasma, and urine.12 In fact, a study conducted by the CDC found detectable levels of
     triclosan in the urine of 75% of 2,517 people tested in 2003-2004.13 This finding is even more troubling given the
     evidence that triclosan may affect immune function in humans.14

     In December 2013, the FDA gave soap manufacturers until 2016 to prove that antibacterial soaps provide a
     significant benefit over traditional soaps; if unable to do so, manufacturers will be forced to remove these products
     from the market.

by binding to proteins, thus inhibiting enzymatic activity (Figure 13.21). Heavy metals are oligodynamic, meaning
that very small concentrations show significant antimicrobial activity. Ions of heavy metals bind to sulfur-containing
amino acids strongly and bioaccumulate within cells, allowing these metals to reach high localized concentrations.
This causes proteins to denature.

Heavy metals are not selectively toxic to microbial cells. They may bioaccumulate in human or animal cells, as well,
and excessive concentrations can have toxic effects on humans. If too much silver accumulates in the body, for
example, it can result in a condition called argyria, in which the skin turns irreversibly blue-gray. One way to reduce
the potential toxicity of heavy metals is by carefully controlling the duration of exposure and concentration of the
heavy metal.

FIGURE 13.21 Heavy metals denature proteins, impairing cell function and, thus, giving them strong antimicrobial properties. (a) Copper in

Mercury
Mercury is an example of a heavy metal that has been used for many years to control microbial growth. It was used
for many centuries to treat syphilis. Mercury compounds like mercuric chloride are mainly bacteriostatic and have a
very broad spectrum of activity. Various forms of mercury bind to sulfur-containing amino acids within proteins,
inhibiting their functions.

In recent decades, the use of such compounds has diminished because of mercury's toxicity. It is toxic to the
central nervous, digestive, and renal systems at high concentrations, and has negative environmental effects,
including bioaccumulation in fish. Topical antiseptics such as mercurochrome, which contains mercury in low
concentrations, and merthiolate, a tincture (a solution of mercury dissolved in alcohol) were once commonly used.
However, because of concerns about using mercury compounds, these antiseptics are no longer sold in the United
States.

Silver
Silver has long been used as an antiseptic. In ancient times, drinking water was stored in silver jugs.15 Silvadene
cream is commonly used to treat topical wounds and is particularly helpful in preventing infection in burn wounds.
Silver nitrate drops were once routinely applied to the eyes of newborns to protect against ophthalmia neonatorum,
eye infections that can occur due to exposure to pathogens in the birth canal, but antibiotic creams are more now
commonly used. Silver is often combined with antibiotics, making the antibiotics thousands of times more
effective.16 Silver is also commonly incorporated into catheters and bandages, rendering them antimicrobial;
however, there is evidence that heavy metals may also enhance selection for antibiotic resistance.17

     Copper, Nickel, and Zinc
     Several other heavy metals also exhibit antimicrobial activity. Copper sulfate is a common algicide used to control
     algal growth in swimming pools and fish tanks. The use of metallic copper to minimize microbial growth is also
     becoming more widespread. Copper linings in incubators help reduce contamination of cell cultures. The use of
     copper pots for water storage in underdeveloped countries is being investigated as a way to combat diarrheal
     diseases. Copper coatings are also becoming popular for frequently handled objects such as doorknobs, cabinet
     hardware, and other fixtures in health-care facilities in an attempt to reduce the spread of microbes.

     Nickel and zinc coatings are now being used in a similar way. Other forms of zinc, including zinc chloride and zinc
     oxide, are also used commercially. Zinc chloride is quite safe for humans and is commonly found in mouthwashes,
     substantially increasing their length of effectiveness. Zinc oxide is found in a variety of products, including topical
     antiseptic creams such as calamine lotion, diaper ointments, baby powder, and dandruff shampoos.

     Halogens

     Other chemicals commonly used for disinfection are the halogens iodine, chlorine, and fluorine. Iodine works by
     oxidizing cellular components, including sulfur-containing amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids, and
     destabilizing the macromolecules that contain these molecules. It is often used as a topical tincture, but it may
     cause staining or skin irritation. An iodophor is a compound of iodine complexed with an organic molecule, thereby
     increasing iodine's stability and, in turn, its efficacy. One common iodophor is povidone-iodine, which includes a
     wetting agent that releases iodine relatively slowly. Betadine is a brand of povidone-iodine commonly used as a
     hand scrub by medical personnel before surgery and for topical antisepsis of a patient's skin before incision (Figure
     13.22).

     FIGURE 13.22 (a) Betadine is a solution of the iodophor povidone-iodine. (b) It is commonly used as a topical antiseptic on a patient's skin
     before incision during surgery. (credit b: modification of work by Andrew Ratto)

     Chlorine is another halogen commonly used for disinfection. When chlorine gas is mixed with water, it produces a
     strong oxidant called hypochlorous acid, which is uncharged and enters cells easily. Chlorine gas is commonly used
     in municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment plants, with the resulting hypochlorous acid producing the
     actual antimicrobial effect. Those working at water treatment facilities need to take great care to minimize personal
     exposure to chlorine gas. Sodium hypochlorite is the chemical component of common household bleach, and it is
     also used for a wide variety of disinfecting purposes. Hypochlorite salts, including sodium and calcium
     hypochlorites, are used to disinfect swimming pools. Chlorine gas, sodium hypochlorite, and calcium hypochlorite
     are also commonly used disinfectants in the food processing and restaurant industries to reduce the spread of
     foodborne diseases. Workers in these industries also need to take care to use these products correctly to ensure
     their own safety as well as the safety of consumers. A recent joint statement published by the Food and Agriculture
     Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and WHO indicated that none of the many beneficial uses of chlorine
     products in food processing to reduce the spread of foodborne illness posed risks to consumers.18

Another class of chlorinated compounds called chloramines are widely used as disinfectants. Chloramines are
relatively stable, releasing chlorine over long periods time. Chloramines are derivatives of ammonia by substitution
of one, two, or all three hydrogen atoms with chlorine atoms (Figure 13.23).

FIGURE 13.23 Monochloroamine, one of the chloramines, is derived from ammonia by the replacement of one hydrogen atom with a
chlorine atom.

Chloramines and other cholorine compounds may be used for disinfection of drinking water, and chloramine tablets
are frequently used by the military for this purpose. After a natural disaster or other event that compromises the
public water supply, the CDC recommends disinfecting tap water by adding small amounts of regular household
bleach. Recent research suggests that sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) may also be a good alternative for
drinking water disinfection. Currently, NaDCC tablets are available for general use and for use by the military,
campers, or those with emergency needs; for these uses, NaDCC is preferable to chloramine tablets. Chlorine
dioxide, a gaseous agent used for fumigation and sterilization of enclosed areas, is also commonly used for the
disinfection of water.

Although chlorinated compounds are relatively effective disinfectants, they have their disadvantages. Some may
irritate the skin, nose, or eyes of some individuals, and they may not completely eliminate certain hardy organisms
from contaminated drinking water. The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium, for example, has a protective outer
shell that makes it resistant to chlorinated disinfectants. Thus, boiling of drinking water in emergency situations is
recommended when possible.

The halogen fluorine is also known to have antimicrobial properties that contribute to the prevention of dental caries
(cavities).19 Fluoride is the main active ingredient of toothpaste and is also commonly added to tap water to help
communities maintain oral health. Chemically, fluoride can become incorporated into the hydroxyapatite of tooth
enamel, making it more resistant to corrosive acids produced by the fermentation of oral microbes. Fluoride also
enhances the uptake of calcium and phosphate ions in tooth enamel, promoting remineralization. In addition to
strengthening enamel, fluoride also seems to be bacteriostatic. It accumulates in plaque-forming bacteria,
interfering with their metabolism and reducing their production of the acids that contribute to tooth decay.

Alcohols

Alcohols make up another group of chemicals commonly used as disinfectants and antiseptics. They work by rapidly
denaturing proteins, which inhibits cell metabolism, and by disrupting membranes, which leads to cell lysis. Once
denatured, the proteins may potentially refold if enough water is present in the solution. Alcohols are typically used
at concentrations of about 70% aqueous solution and, in fact, work better in aqueous solutions than 100% alcohol
solutions. This is because alcohols coagulate proteins. In higher alcohol concentrations, rapid coagulation of surface
proteins prevents effective penetration of cells. The most commonly used alcohols for disinfection are ethyl alcohol
(ethanol) and isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol, rubbing alcohol) (Figure 13.24).

Alcohols tend to be bactericidal and fungicidal, but may also be viricidal for enveloped viruses only. Although
alcohols are not sporicidal, they do inhibit the processes of sporulation and germination. Alcohols are volatile and
dry quickly, but they may also cause skin irritation because they dehydrate the skin at the site of application. One
common clinical use of alcohols is swabbing the skin for degerming before needle injection. Alcohols also are the
active ingredients in instant hand sanitizers, which have gained popularity in recent years. The alcohol in these hand
sanitizers works both by denaturing proteins and by disrupting the microbial cell membrane, but will not work

     Last, alcohols are used to make tinctures with other antiseptics, such as the iodine tinctures discussed previously in

     microbes. However, one disadvantage of alcohols is their high volatility, limiting their effectiveness to immediately

     Surfactants

     Surface-active agents, or surfactants, are a group of chemical compounds that lower the surface tension of water.
     Surfactants are the major ingredients in soaps and detergents. Soaps are salts of long-chain fatty acids and have
     both polar and nonpolar regions, allowing them to interact with polar and nonpolar regions in other molecules
     (Figure 13.25). They can interact with nonpolar oils and grease to create emulsions in water, loosening and lifting
     away dirt and microbes from surfaces and skin. Soaps do not kill or inhibit microbial growth and so are not
     considered antiseptics or disinfectants. However, proper use of soaps mechanically carries away microorganisms,
     effectively degerming a surface. Some soaps contain added bacteriostatic agents such as triclocarban or
     cloflucarban, compounds structurally related to triclosan, that introduce antiseptic or disinfectant properties to the
     soaps.

     FIGURE 13.25 Soaps are the salts (sodium salt in the illustration) of fatty acids and have the ability to emulsify lipids, fats, and oils by
     interacting with water through their hydrophilic heads and with the lipid at their hydrophobic tails.

     Soaps, however, often form films that are difficult to rinse away, especially in hard water, which contains high
     concentrations of calcium and magnesium mineral salts. Detergents contain synthetic surfactant molecules with
     both polar and nonpolar regions that have strong cleansing activity but are more soluble, even in hard water, and,
     therefore, leave behind no soapy deposits. Anionic detergents, such as those used for laundry, have a negatively
     charged anion at one end attached to a long hydrophobic chain, whereas cationic detergents have a positively
     charged cation instead. Cationic detergents include an important class of disinfectants and antiseptics called the
     quaternary ammonium salts (quats), named for the characteristic quaternary nitrogen atom that confers the

positive charge (Figure 13.26). Overall, quats have properties similar to phospholipids, having hydrophilic and
hydrophobic ends. As such, quats have the ability to insert into the bacterial phospholipid bilayer and disrupt
membrane integrity. The cationic charge of quats appears to confer their antimicrobial properties, which are
diminished when neutralized. Quats have several useful properties. They are stable, nontoxic, inexpensive,
colorless, odorless, and tasteless. They tend to be bactericidal by disrupting membranes. They are also active
against fungi, protozoans, and enveloped viruses, but endospores are unaffected. In clinical settings, they may be
used as antiseptics or to disinfect surfaces. Mixtures of quats are also commonly found in household cleaners and
disinfectants, including many current formulations of Lysol brand products, which contain benzalkonium chlorides
as the active ingredients. Benzalkonium chlorides, along with the quat cetylpyrimidine chloride, are also found in
products such as skin antiseptics, oral rinses, and mouthwashes.

FIGURE 13.26 (a) Two common quats are benzylalkonium chloride and cetylpyrimidine chloride. Note the hydrophobic nonpolar carbon
chain at one end and the nitrogen-containing cationic component at the other end. (b) Quats are able to infiltrate the phospholipid plasma

Handwashing the Right Way

Handwashing is critical for public health and should be emphasized in a clinical setting. For the general public, the
CDC recommends handwashing before, during, and after food handling; before eating; before and after interacting
with someone who is ill; before and after treating a wound; after using the toilet or changing diapers; after coughing,
sneezing, or blowing the nose; after handling garbage; and after interacting with an animal, its feed, or its waste.
Figure 13.27 illustrates the five steps of proper handwashing recommended by the CDC.

Handwashing is even more important for health-care workers, who should wash their hands thoroughly between
every patient contact, after the removal of gloves, after contact with bodily fluids and potentially infectious fomites,
and before and after assisting a surgeon with invasive procedures. Even with the use of proper surgical attire,
including gloves, scrubbing for surgery is more involved than routine handwashing. The goal of surgical scrubbing is
to reduce the normal microbiota on the skin's surface to prevent the introduction of these microbes into a patient's
surgical wounds.
522  13 · Control of Microbial Growth

     There is no single widely accepted protocol for surgical scrubbing. Protocols for length of time spent scrubbing may
     depend on the antimicrobial used; health-care workers should always check the manufacturer's recommendations.
     According to the Association of Surgical Technologists (AST), surgical scrubs may be performed with or without the
     use of brushes (Figure 13.27).

     FIGURE 13.27 (a) The CDC recommends five steps as part of typical handwashing for the general public. (b) Surgical scrubbing is more

Bisbiguanides

Bisbiguanides were first synthesized in the 20th century and are cationic (positively charged) molecules known for
their antiseptic properties (Figure 13.28). One important bisbiguanide antiseptic is chlorhexidine. It has broad-
spectrum activity against yeasts, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may develop resistance on repeated exposure.20 Chlorhexidine disrupts cell
membranes and is bacteriostatic at lower concentrations or bactericidal at higher concentrations, in which it
actually causes the cells' cytoplasmic contents to congeal. It also has activity against enveloped viruses. However,
chlorhexidine is poorly effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nonenveloped viruses, and it is not
sporicidal. Chlorhexidine is typically used in the clinical setting as a surgical scrub and for other handwashing needs
for medical personnel, as well as for topical antisepsis for patients before surgery or needle injection. It is more
persistent than iodophors, providing long-lasting antimicrobial activity. Chlorhexidine solutions may also be used as
oral rinses after oral procedures or to treat gingivitis. Another bisbiguanide, alexidine, is gaining popularity as a
surgical scrub and an oral rinse because it acts faster than chlorhexidine.

Alkylating Agents

The alkylating agents are a group of strong disinfecting chemicals that act by replacing a hydrogen atom within a
molecule with an alkyl group (CnH2n+1), thereby inactivating enzymes and nucleic acids (Figure 13.29). The
alkylating agent formaldehyde (CH2O) is commonly used in solution at a concentration of 37% (known as formalin)
or as a gaseous disinfectant and biocide. It is a strong, broad-spectrum disinfectant and biocide that has the ability
to kill bacteria, viruses, fungi, and endospores, leading to sterilization at low temperatures, which is sometimes a
convenient alternative to the more labor-intensive heat sterilization methods. It also cross-links proteins and has
been widely used as a chemical fixative. Because of this, it is used for the storage of tissue specimens and as an
embalming fluid. It also has been used to inactivate infectious agents in vaccine preparation. Formaldehyde is very
irritating to living tissues and is also carcinogenic; therefore, it is not used as an antiseptic.

Glutaraldehyde is structurally similar to formaldehyde but has two reactive aldehyde groups, allowing it to act more
quickly than formaldehyde. It is commonly used as a 2% solution for sterilization and is marketed under the brand
name Cidex. It is used to disinfect a variety of surfaces and surgical and medical equipment. However, similar to
formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde irritates the skin and is not used as an antiseptic.

A new type of disinfectant gaining popularity for the disinfection of medical equipment is o-phthalaldehyde (OPA),
which is found in some newer formulations of Cidex and similar products, replacing glutaraldehyde. o-
Phthalaldehyde also has two reactive aldehyde groups, but they are linked by an aromatic bridge. o-Phthalaldehyde
is thought to work similarly to glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde, but is much less irritating to skin and nasal
passages, produces a minimal odor, does not require processing before use, and is more effective against
mycobacteria.

Ethylene oxide is a type of alkylating agent that is used for gaseous sterilization. It is highly penetrating and can
sterilize items within plastic bags such as catheters, disposable items in laboratories and clinical settings (like
packaged Petri dishes), and other pieces of equipment. Ethylene oxide exposure is a form of cold sterilization,

     making it useful for the sterilization of heat-sensitive items. Great care needs to be taken with the use of ethylene
     oxide, however; it is carcinogenic, like the other alkylating agents, and is also highly explosive. With careful use and
     proper aeration of the products after treatment, ethylene oxide is highly effective, and ethylene oxide sterilizers are
     commonly found in medical settings for sterilizing packaged materials.

     -Propionolactone is an alkylating agent with a different chemical structure than the others already discussed. Like
     other alkylating agents, -propionolactone binds to DNA, thereby inactivating it (Figure 13.29). It is a clear liquid
     with a strong odor and has the ability to kill endospores. As such, it has been used in either liquid form or as a vapor
     for the sterilization of medical instruments and tissue grafts, and it is a common component of vaccines, used to
     maintain their sterility. It has also been used for the sterilization of nutrient broth, as well as blood plasma, milk, and
     water. It is quickly metabolized by animals and humans to lactic acid. It is also an irritant, however, and may lead to
     permanent damage of the eyes, kidneys, or liver. Additionally, it has been shown to be carcinogenic in animals; thus,
     precautions are necessary to minimize human exposure to -propionolactone.21

to heat, chemicals, and radiation. They are also extremely infectious and deadly; thus, handling and disposing of
prion-infected items requires extensive training and extreme caution.

Typical methods of disinfection can reduce but not eliminate the infectivity of prions. Autoclaving is not completely
effective, nor are chemicals such as phenol, alcohols, formalin, and -propiolactone. Even when fixed in formalin,
affected brain and spinal cord tissues remain infectious.

Personnel who handle contaminated specimens or equipment or work with infected patients must wear a protective
coat, face protection, and cut-resistant gloves. Any contact with skin must be immediately washed with detergent
and warm water without scrubbing. The skin should then be washed with 1 N NaOH or a 1:10 dilution of bleach for 1
minute. Contaminated waste must be incinerated or autoclaved in a strong basic solution, and instruments must be
cleaned and soaked in a strong basic solution.

Peroxygens

Peroxygens are strong oxidizing agents that can be used as disinfectants or antiseptics. The most widely used
peroxygen is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is often used in solution to disinfect surfaces and may also be used
as a gaseous agent. Hydrogen peroxide solutions are inexpensive skin antiseptics that break down into water and
oxygen gas, both of which are environmentally safe. This decomposition is accelerated in the presence of light, so
hydrogen peroxide solutions typically are sold in brown or opaque bottles. One disadvantage of using hydrogen
peroxide as an antiseptic is that it also causes damage to skin that may delay healing or lead to scarring. Contact
lens cleaners often include hydrogen peroxide as a disinfectant.

Hydrogen peroxide works by producing free radicals that damage cellular macromolecules. Hydrogen peroxide has
broad-spectrum activity, working against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (with slightly greater efficacy
against gram-positive bacteria), fungi, viruses, and endospores. However, bacteria that produce the oxygen-
detoxifying enzymes catalase or peroxidase may have inherent tolerance to low hydrogen peroxide concentrations
(Figure 13.30). To kill endospores, the length of exposure or concentration of solutions of hydrogen peroxide must
be increased. Gaseous hydrogen peroxide has greater efficacy and can be used as a sterilant for rooms or
equipment.

used to clean wounds. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize items such as contact lenses. (credit photos: modification of work by Kerry
Ceszyk)

Plasma, a hot, ionized gas, described as the fourth state of matter, is useful for sterilizing equipment because it
penetrates surfaces and kills vegetative cells and endospores. Hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid, another
commonly used peroxygen, each may be introduced as a plasma. Peracetic acid can be used as a liquid or plasma
sterilant insofar as it readily kills endospores, is more effective than hydrogen peroxide even at rather low
526  13 · Control of Microbial Growth

     concentrations, and is immune to inactivation by catalases and peroxidases. It also breaks down to environmentally
     innocuous compounds; in this case, acetic acid and oxygen.

     Other examples of peroxygens include benzoyl peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is a peroxygen
     that used in acne medication solutions. It kills the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is associated with
     acne. Carbamide peroxide, an ingredient used in toothpaste, is a peroxygen that combats oral biofilms that cause
     tooth discoloration and halitosis (bad breath).22 Last, ozone gas is a peroxygen with disinfectant qualities and is
     used to clean air or water supplies. Overall, peroxygens are highly effective and commonly used, with no associated
     environmental hazard.

     Supercritical Fluids

     Within the last 15 years, the use of supercritical fluids, especially supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), has gained
     popularity for certain sterilizing applications. When carbon dioxide is brought to approximately 10 times
     atmospheric pressure, it reaches a supercritical state that has physical properties between those of liquids and
     gases. Materials put into a chamber in which carbon dioxide is pressurized in this way can be sterilized because of
     the ability of scCO2 to penetrate surfaces.

     Supercritical carbon dioxide works by penetrating cells and forming carbonic acid, thereby lowering the cell pH
     considerably. This technique is effective against vegetative cells and is also used in combination with peracetic acid
     to kill endospores. Its efficacy can also be augmented with increased temperature or by rapid cycles of
     pressurization and depressurization, which more likely produce cell lysis.

     Benefits of scCO2 include the nonreactive, nontoxic, and nonflammable properties of carbon dioxide, and this
     protocol is effective at low temperatures. Unlike other methods, such as heat and irradiation, that can degrade the
     object being sterilized, the use of scCO2 preserves the object's integrity and is commonly used for treating foods
     (including spices and juices) and medical devices such as endoscopes. It is also gaining popularity for disinfecting
     tissues such as skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments prior to transplantation. scCO2 can also be used for pest control
     because it can kill insect eggs and larvae within products.

     Chemical Food Preservatives

     Chemical preservatives are used to inhibit microbial growth and minimize spoilage in some foods. Commonly used
     chemical preservatives include sorbic acid, benzoic acid, and propionic acid, and their more soluble salts potassium
     sorbate, sodium benzoate, and calcium propionate, all of which are used to control the growth of molds in acidic
     foods. Each of these preservatives is nontoxic and readily metabolized by humans. They are also flavorless, so they
     do not compromise the flavor of the foods they preserve.

     Sorbic and benzoic acids exhibit increased efficacy as the pH decreases. Sorbic acid is thought to work by inhibiting
     various cellular enzymes, including those in the citric acid cycle, as well as catalases and peroxidases. It is added as
     a preservative in a wide variety of foods, including dairy, bread, fruit, and vegetable products. Benzoic acid is found
     naturally in many types of fruits and berries, spices, and fermented products. It is thought to work by decreasing
     intracellular pH, interfering with mechanisms such as oxidative phosphorylation and the uptake of molecules such
     as amino acids into cells. Foods preserved with benzoic acid or sodium benzoate include fruit juices, jams, ice
     creams, pastries, soft drinks, chewing gum, and pickles.

Propionic acid is thought to both inhibit enzymes and decrease intracellular pH, working similarly to benzoic acid.
However, propionic acid is a more effective preservative at a higher pH than either sorbic acid or benzoic acid.
Propionic acid is naturally produced by some cheeses during their ripening and is added to other types of cheese
and baked goods to prevent mold contamination. It is also added to raw dough to prevent contamination by the
bacterium Bacillus mesentericus, which causes bread to become ropy.

Other commonly used chemical preservatives include sulfur dioxide and nitrites. Sulfur dioxide prevents browning
of foods and is used for the preservation of dried fruits; it has been used in winemaking since ancient times. Sulfur
dioxide gas dissolves in water readily, forming sulfites. Although sulfites can be metabolized by the body, some
people have sulfite allergies, including asthmatic reactions. Additionally, sulfites degrade thiamine, an important
nutrient in some foods. The mode of action of sulfites is not entirely clear, but they may interfere with the disulfide
bond (see Figure 7.21) formation in proteins, inhibiting enzymatic activity. Alternatively, they may reduce the
intracellular pH of the cell, interfering with proton motive force-driven mechanisms.

Nitrites are added to processed meats to maintain color and stop the germination of Clostridium botulinum
endospores. Nitrites are reduced to nitric oxide, which reacts with heme groups and iron-sulfur groups. When nitric
oxide reacts with the heme group within the myoglobin of meats, a red product forms, giving meat its red color.
Alternatively, it is thought that when nitric acid reacts with the iron-sulfur enzyme ferredoxin within bacteria, this
electron transport-chain carrier is destroyed, preventing ATP synthesis. Nitrosamines, however, are carcinogenic
and can be produced through exposure of nitrite-preserved meats (e.g., hot dogs, lunch meat, breakfast sausage,
bacon, meat in canned soups) to heat during cooking.

Natural Chemical Food Preservatives
The discovery of natural antimicrobial substances produced by other microbes has added to the arsenal of
preservatives used in food. Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide produced by the bacterium Lactococcus lactis and is
particularly effective against gram-positive organisms. Nisin works by disrupting cell wall production, leaving cells
more prone to lysis. It is used to preserve cheeses, meats, and beverages.

Natamycin is an antifungal macrolide antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces natalensis. It was
approved by the FDA in 1982 and is used to prevent fungal growth in various types of dairy products, including
cottage cheese, sliced cheese, and shredded cheese. Natamycin is also used for meat preservation in countries
outside the United States.

     13.4 Testing the Effectiveness of Antiseptics and Disinfectants

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe why the phenol coefficient is used
         · Compare and contrast the disk-diffusion, use-dilution, and in-use methods for testing the effectiveness of

             antiseptics, disinfectants, and sterilants

     The effectiveness of various chemical disinfectants is reflected in the terms used to describe them. Chemical
     disinfectants are grouped by the power of their activity, with each category reflecting the types of microbes and
     viruses its component disinfectants are effective against. High-level germicides have the ability to kill vegetative
     cells, fungi, viruses, and endospores, leading to sterilization, with extended use. Intermediate-level germicides, as
     their name suggests, are less effective against endospores and certain viruses, and low-level germicides kill only
     vegetative cells and certain enveloped viruses, and are ineffective against endospores.

     However, several environmental conditions influence the potency of an antimicrobial agent and its effectiveness. For
     example, length of exposure is particularly important, with longer exposure increasing efficacy. Similarly, the
     concentration of the chemical agent is also important, with higher concentrations being more effective than lower
     ones. Temperature, pH, and other factors can also affect the potency of a disinfecting agent.

     One method to determine the effectiveness of a chemical agent includes swabbing surfaces before and after use to
     confirm whether a sterile field was maintained during use. Additional tests are described in the sections that follow.
     These tests allow for the maintenance of appropriate disinfection protocols in clinical settings, controlling microbial
     growth to protect patients, health-care workers, and the community.

     Phenol Coefficient

     The effectiveness of a disinfectant or antiseptic can be determined in a number of ways. Historically, a chemical
     agent's effectiveness was often compared with that of phenol, the first chemical agent used by Joseph Lister. In
     1903, British chemists Samuel Rideal (1863-1929) and J. T. Ainslie Walker (1868-1930) established a protocol to
     compare the effectiveness of a variety of chemicals with that of phenol, using as their test organisms
     Staphylococcus aureus (a gram-positive bacterium) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (a gram-negative
     bacterium). They exposed the test bacteria to the antimicrobial chemical solutions diluted in water for 7.5 minutes.
     They then calculated a phenol coefficient for each chemical for each of the two bacteria tested. A phenol
     coefficient of 1.0 means that the chemical agent has about the same level of effectiveness as phenol. A chemical
     agent with a phenol coefficient of less than 1.0 is less effective than phenol. An example is formalin, with phenol
     coefficients of 0.3 (S. aureus) and 0.7 (S. enterica serovar Typhi). A chemical agent with a phenol coefficient greater
     than 1.0 is more effective than phenol, such as chloramine, with phenol coefficients of 133 and 100, respectively.
     Although the phenol coefficient was once a useful measure of effectiveness, it is no longer commonly used because
     the conditions and organisms used were arbitrarily chosen.

     Disk-Diffusion Method

     The disk-diffusion method involves applying different chemicals to separate, sterile filter paper disks (Figure
     13.31). The disks are then placed on an agar plate that has been inoculated with the targeted bacterium and the
     chemicals diffuse out of the disks into the agar where the bacteria have been inoculated. As the "lawn" of bacteria
     grows, zones of inhibition of microbial growth are observed as clear areas around the disks. Although there are other
     factors that contribute to the sizes of zones of inhibition (e.g., whether the agent is water soluble and able to diffuse
     in the agar), larger zones typically correlate to increased inhibition effectiveness of the chemical agent. The diameter
     across each zone is measured in millimeters.

    · When comparing the activities of two disinfectants against the same microbe, using the disk-diffusion assay,
        and assuming both are water soluble and can easily diffuse in the agar, would a more effective disinfectant
        have a larger zone of inhibition or a smaller one?

Use-Dilution Test

Other methods are also used for measuring the effectiveness of a chemical agent in clinical settings. The use-
dilution test is commonly used to determine a chemical's disinfection effectiveness on an inanimate surface. For
this test, a cylinder of stainless steel is dipped in a culture of the targeted microorganism and then dried. The
cylinder is then dipped in solutions of disinfectant at various concentrations for a specified amount of time. Finally,
the cylinder is transferred to a new test tube containing fresh sterile medium that does not contain disinfectant, and
this test tube is incubated. Bacterial survival is demonstrated by the presence of turbidity in the medium, whereas
killing of the target organism on the cylinder by the disinfectant will produce no turbidity.

The Association of Official Agricultural Chemists International (AOAC), a nonprofit group that establishes many
protocol standards, has determined that a minimum of 59 of 60 replicates must show no growth in such a test to
achieve a passing result, and the results must be repeatable from different batches of disinfectant and when
performed on different days. Disinfectant manufacturers perform use-dilution tests to validate the efficacy claims
for their products, as designated by the EPA.

In-Use Test

An in-use test can determine whether an actively used solution of disinfectant in a clinical setting is microbially
contaminated (Figure 13.32). A 1-mL sample of the used disinfectant is diluted into 9 mL of sterile broth medium
that also contains a compound to inactivate the disinfectant. Ten drops, totaling approximately 0.2 mL of this
mixture, are then inoculated onto each of two agar plates. One plate is incubated at 37 °C for 3 days and the other is
incubated at room temperature for 7 days. The plates are monitored for growth of microbial colonies. Growth of five
or more colonies on either plate suggests that viable microbial cells existed in the disinfectant solution and that it is
contaminated. Such in-use tests monitor the effectiveness of disinfectants in the clinical setting.

     New Methods to Overcome Specific Challenges
     Some pathogens have characteristics that make disinfectant efficacy difficult to prove. Human pappiloma virus
     (HPV), for example, cannot be cultured, so the previously described methods do not work. And since HPV's protein-
     only capsid enables it to survive on surfaces for an extended period of time, medical professionals rely on
     disinfectants to ensure the virus doesn't spread through facilities or equipment.

     New Mexico State University's Michelle Ozbun, one of the foremost experts on HPV, developed a method to quantify
     (count) live virus on surfaces outside the body. The typical method for counting viruses like HPV is to grind up
     infected cells and measure the amount of viral DNA, but this method is imprecise and does not demonstrate the
     scope of the infection. To test the disinfectant's live virus was required. Instead of grinding up infected cells, Ozbun
     applied a stain that only attaches to viral RNA.

     Using advanced microscopy, the quantities of infected cells can be determined with great accuracy. For the HVP
     disinfectant testing, Ozbun and her team applied various disinfectants to three HPV from three sources, and
     determined that the chemicals reduced the amount of virus by 10,000 times. This technique can be used for
     disinfectant testing for other protein-capsid viruses (like norovirus and poliovirus) and to produce accurate viral
     counting for other research or clinical applications.

       Despite antibiotic treatment, Roberta's symptoms worsened. She developed pyelonephritis, a severe kidney
       infection, and was rehospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she
       developed symptoms of septic shock. At this point, her physician ordered a culture from her urine to determine
       the exact cause of her infection, as well as a drug sensitivity test to determine what antibiotics would be
       effective against the causative bacterium. The results of this test indicated resistance to a wide range of
       antibiotics, including the carbapenems, a class of antibiotics that are used as the last resort for many types of
       bacterial infections. This was an alarming outcome, suggesting that Roberta's infection was caused by a so-

called superbug: a bacterial strain that has developed resistance to the majority of commonly used antibiotics.
In this case, the causative agent belonged to the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a drug-
resistant family of bacteria normally found in the digestive system (Figure 13.33). When CRE is introduced to
other body systems, as might occur through improperly cleaned surgical instruments, catheters, or endoscopes,
aggressive infections can occur.

CRE infections are notoriously difficult to treat, with a 40%-50% fatality rate. To treat her kidney infection and
septic shock, Roberta was treated with dialysis, intravenous fluids, and medications to maintain blood pressure
and prevent blood clotting. She was also started on aggressive treatment with intravenous administration of a
new drug called tigecycline, which has been successful in treating infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.

After several weeks in the ICU, Roberta recovered from her CRE infection. However, public health officials soon
noticed that Roberta's case was not isolated. Several patients who underwent similar procedures at the same
hospital also developed CRE infections, some dying as a result. Ultimately, the source of the infection was traced
to the duodenoscopes used in the procedures. Despite the hospital staff meticulously following manufacturer
protocols for disinfection, bacteria, including CRE, remained within the instruments and were introduced to
patients during procedures.

EYE ON ETHICS

Who Is Responsible?

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections due to contaminated endoscopes have become a high-
profile problem in recent years. Several CRE outbreaks have been traced to endoscopes, including a case at
Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in early 2015 in which 179 patients may have been exposed to a
contaminated endoscope. Seven of the patients developed infections, and two later died. Several lawsuits have
been filed against Olympus, the manufacturer of the endoscopes. Some claim that Olympus did not obtain FDA
approval for design changes that may have led to contamination, and others claim that the manufacturer
knowingly withheld information from hospitals concerning defects in the endoscopes.

Lawsuits like these raise difficult-to-answer questions about liability. Invasive procedures are inherently risky,
but negative outcomes can be minimized by strict adherence to established protocols. Who is responsible,
however, when negative outcomes occur due to flawed protocols or faulty equipment? Can hospitals or health-
534  13 · Control of Microbial Growth

     care workers be held liable if they have strictly followed a flawed procedure? Should manufacturers be held
     liable--and perhaps be driven out of business--if their lifesaving equipment fails or is found defective? What is
     the government's role in ensuring that use and maintenance of medical equipment and protocols are fail-safe?

     Protocols for cleaning or sterilizing medical equipment are often developed by government agencies like the
     FDA, and other groups, like the AOAC, a nonprofit scientific organization that establishes many protocols for
     standard use globally. These procedures and protocols are then adopted by medical device and equipment
     manufacturers. Ultimately, the end-users (hospitals and their staff) are responsible for following these
     procedures and can be held liable if a breach occurs and patients become ill from improperly cleaned
     equipment.

     Unfortunately, protocols are not infallible, and sometimes it takes negative outcomes to reveal their flaws. In
     2008, the FDA had approved a disinfection protocol for endoscopes, using glutaraldehyde (at a lower
     concentration when mixed with phenol), o-phthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and a mix of
     hydrogen peroxide with peracetic acid. However, subsequent CRE outbreaks from endoscope use showed that
     this protocol alone was inadequate.

     As a result of CRE outbreaks, hospitals, manufacturers, and the FDA are investigating solutions. Many hospitals
     are instituting more rigorous cleaning procedures than those mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers are looking
     for ways to redesign duodenoscopes to minimize hard-to-reach crevices where bacteria can escape
     disinfectants, and the FDA is updating its protocols. In February 2015, the FDA added new recommendations for
     careful hand cleaning of the duodenoscope elevator mechanism (the location where microbes are most likely to
     escape disinfection), and issued more careful documentation about quality control of disinfection protocols
     (Figure 13.34).

     There is no guarantee that new procedures, protocols, or equipment will completely eliminate the risk for
     infection associated with endoscopes. Yet these devices are used successfully in 500,000-650,000 procedures
     annually in the United States, many of them lifesaving. At what point do the risks outweigh the benefits of these
     devices, and who should be held responsible when negative outcomes occur?

INTRODUCTION In nature, some microbes produce substances that inhibit or kill other microbes that might
otherwise compete for the same resources. Humans have successfully exploited these abilities, using microbes to
mass-produce substances that can be used as antimicrobial drugs. Since their discovery, antimicrobial drugs have
saved countless lives, and they remain an essential tool for treating and controlling infectious disease. But their
widespread and often unnecessary use has had an unintended side effect: the rise of multidrug-resistant microbial
strains. In this chapter, we will discuss how antimicrobial drugs work, why microbes develop resistance, and what
health professionals can do to encourage responsible use of antimicrobials.

       Part 1

       Marisa, a 52-year-old woman, was suffering from severe abdominal pain, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and a
       fever. She had just returned home from visiting extended family in her native country of Cambodia. While
       abroad, she received medical care in neighboring Vietnam for a compressed spinal cord. She still had discomfort
       when leaving Cambodia, but the pain increased as her trip home continued and her husband drove her straight
       from the airport to the emergency room.

       Her doctor considers whether Marisa could be suffering from appendicitis, a urinary tract infection (UTI), or
       pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, each of those conditions is typically preceded or accompanied by
       additional symptoms. He considers the treatment she received in Vietnam for her compressed spinal cord, but
       abdominal pain is not usually associated with spinal cord compression. He examines her health history further.

     Most people associate the term chemotherapy with treatments for cancer. However, chemotherapy is actually a
     broader term that refers to any use of chemicals or drugs to treat disease. Chemotherapy may involve drugs that
     target cancerous cells or tissues, or it may involve antimicrobial drugs that target infectious microorganisms.
     Antimicrobial drugs typically work by destroying or interfering with microbial structures and enzymes, either killing
     microbial cells or inhibiting their growth. But before we examine how these drugs work, we will briefly explore the
     history of humans' use of antimicrobials for the purpose of chemotherapy.

     Use of Antimicrobials in Ancient Societies

     Although the discovery of antimicrobials and their subsequent widespread use is commonly associated with modern
     medicine, there is evidence that humans have been exposed to antimicrobial compounds for millennia. Chemical
     analyses of the skeletal remains of people from Nubia2 (now found in present-day Sudan) dating from between 350
     and 550 AD have shown residue of the antimicrobial agent tetracycline in high enough quantities to suggest the
     purposeful fermentation of tetracycline-producing Streptomyces during the beer-making process. The resulting
     beer, which was thick and gruel-like, was used to treat a variety of ailments in both adults and children, including
     gum disease and wounds. The antimicrobial properties of certain plants may also have been recognized by various
     cultures around the world, including Indian and Chinese herbalists (Figure 14.2) who have long used plants for a
     wide variety of medical purposes. More contemporary researchers have utilized practices and even texts from these
     traditional sources. For example, Chinese researcher Tu Youyou, who in the 1970s was selected to lead a
     government effort to find a cure for malaria, utilized Artemisia, a plant she identified by consulting 4th Century
     physician Ge Hong's Handbook of Prescription's for Emergencies. After initial efforts were unsuccessful, Youyou and
     her team more carefully followed the 1650-year-old text's method of extracting the plant's chemicals, and within a
     year had conducted a trial that successfully cured malaria patients.3 Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in
     Physiology or Medicine in 2015. Healers of many cultures understood the antimicrobial properties of fungi and their
     use of moldy bread or other mold-containing products to treat wounds has been well documented for centuries.4
     Today, while about 80% of the world's population still relies on plant-derived medicines,5 scientists are now
     discovering the active compounds conferring the medicinal benefits contained in many of these traditionally used
     plants.

    · Give examples of how antimicrobials were used in ancient societies.

The First Antimicrobial Drugs

Societies relied on traditional medicine for thousands of years; however, the first half of the 20th century brought an
era of strategic drug discovery. In the early 1900s, the German physician and scientist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) set
out to discover or synthesize chemical compounds capable of killing infectious microbes without harming the
patient. In 1909, after screening more than 600 arsenic-containing compounds, Ehrlich's assistant Sahachiro Hata
(1873-1938) found one such "magic bullet." Compound 606 targeted the bacterium Treponema pallidum, the
causative agent of syphilis. Compound 606 was found to successfully cure syphilis in rabbits and soon after was
marketed under the name Salvarsan as a remedy for the disease in humans (Figure 14.3). Ehrlich's innovative
approach of systematically screening a wide variety of compounds remains a common strategy for the discovery of
new antimicrobial agents even today.

     FIGURE 14.3 Paul Ehrlich was influential in the discovery of Compound 606, an antimicrobial agent that proved to be an effective treatment
     for syphilis.

     A few decades later, German scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk discovered the
     antibacterial activity of a synthetic dye, prontosil, that could treat streptococcal and staphylococcal infections in
     mice. Domagk's own daughter was one of the first human recipients of the drug, which completely cured her of a
     severe streptococcal infection that had resulted from a poke with an embroidery needle. Gerhard Domagk
     (1895-1964) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1939 for his work with prontosil and sulfanilamide, the
     active breakdown product of prontosil in the body. Sulfanilamide, the first synthetic antimicrobial created, served as
     the foundation for the chemical development of a family of sulfa drugs. A synthetic antimicrobial is a drug that is
     developed from a chemical not found in nature. The success of the sulfa drugs led to the discovery and production
     of additional important classes of synthetic antimicrobials, including the quinolines and oxazolidinones.

     A few years before the discovery of prontosil, scientist Alexander Fleming (1881-1955) made his own accidental
     discovery that turned out to be monumental. In 1928, Fleming returned from holiday and examined some old plates
     of staphylococci in his research laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London. He observed that contaminating mold
     growth (subsequently identified as a strain of Penicillium notatum) inhibited staphylococcal growth on one plate.
     Fleming, therefore, is credited with the discovery of penicillin, the first natural antibiotic, (Figure 14.4). Further
     experimentation showed that penicillin from the mold was antibacterial against streptococci, meningococci, and
     Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria.

     Fleming and his colleagues were credited with discovering and identifying penicillin, but its isolation and mass
     production were accomplished by a team of researchers at Oxford University under the direction of Howard Florey
     (1898-1968) and Ernst Chain (1906-1979) (Figure 14.4). In 1940, the research team purified penicillin and
     reported its success as an antimicrobial agent against streptococcal infections in mice. Their subsequent work with
     human subjects also showed penicillin to be very effective. Because of their important work, Fleming, Florey, and
     Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1945.

     In the early 1940s, scientist Dorothy Hodgkin (1910-1994), who studied crystallography at Oxford University, used
     X-rays to analyze the structure of a variety of natural products. In 1946, she determined the structure of penicillin,
     for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. Once the structure was understood, scientists
     could modify it to produce a variety of semisynthetic penicillins. A semisynthetic antimicrobial is a chemically
     modified derivative of a natural antibiotic. The chemical modifications are generally designed to increase the range
     of bacteria targeted, increase stability, decrease toxicity, or confer other properties beneficial for treating infections.

Penicillin is only one example of a natural antibiotic. Also in the 1940s, Selman Waksman (1888-1973) (Figure
14.5), a prominent soil microbiologist at Rutgers University, led a research team that discovered several
antimicrobials, including actinomycin, streptomycin, and neomycin. The discoveries of these antimicrobials
stemmed from Waksman's study of fungi and the Actinobacteria, including soil bacteria in the genus Streptomyces,
known for their natural production of a wide variety of antimicrobials. Key collaborators included Arthur Shatz, who
first isolated streptomycin, and Elizabeth Bugie, who performed the antibacterial testing for the substance. All three
were included on the critical paper about the discovery, but Waksman was noted for playing down the role of his
collaborators in later writings and in the patent process. He was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in
1952. The actinomycetes are the source of more than half of all natural antibiotics6 and continue to serve as an
excellent reservoir for the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents. Some researchers argue that we have not yet
come close to tapping the full antimicrobial potential of this group.7

     14.2 Fundamentals of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Contrast bacteriostatic versus bactericidal antibacterial activities
         · Contrast broad-spectrum drugs versus narrow-spectrum drugs
         · Explain the significance of superinfections
         · Discuss the significance of dosage and the route of administration of a drug
         · Identify factors and variables that can influence the side effects of a drug
         · Describe the significance of positive and negative interactions between drugs

     Several factors are important in choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial drug therapy, including bacteriostatic
     versus bactericidal mechanisms, spectrum of activity, dosage and route of administration, the potential for side
     effects, and the potential interactions between drugs. The following discussion will focus primarily on antibacterial
     drugs, but the concepts translate to other antimicrobial classes.

     Bacteriostatic Versus Bactericidal

     Antibacterial drugs can be either bacteriostatic or bactericidal in their interactions with target bacteria.
     Bacteriostatic drugs cause a reversible inhibition of growth, with bacterial growth restarting after elimination of the
     drug. By contrast, bactericidal drugs kill their target bacteria. The decision of whether to use a bacteriostatic or
     bactericidal drugs depends on the type of infection and the immune status of the patient. In a patient with strong
     immune defenses, bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs can be effective in achieving clinical cure. However, when a
     patient is immunocompromised, a bactericidal drug is essential for the successful treatment of infections.
     Regardless of the immune status of the patient, life-threatening infections such as acute endocarditis require the
     use of a bactericidal drug.

     Spectrum of Activity

     The spectrum of activity of an antibacterial drug relates to diversity of targeted bacteria. A narrow-spectrum
     antimicrobial targets only specific subsets of bacterial pathogens. For example, some narrow-spectrum drugs only
     target gram-positive bacteria, whereas others target only gram-negative bacteria. If the pathogen causing an
     infection has been identified, it is best to use a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial and minimize collateral damage to
     the normal microbiota. A broad-spectrum antimicrobial targets a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, including
     both gram-positive and gram-negative species, and is frequently used as empiric therapy to cover a wide range of
     potential pathogens while waiting on the laboratory identification of the infecting pathogen. Broad-spectrum
     antimicrobials are also used for polymicrobic infections (mixed infection with multiple bacterial species), or as
     prophylactic prevention of infections with surgery/invasive procedures. Finally, broad-spectrum antimicrobials may
     be selected to treat an infection when a narrow-spectrum drug fails because of development of drug resistance by
     the target pathogen.

     The risk associated with using broad-spectrum antimicrobials is that they will also target a broad spectrum of the
     normal microbiota, increasing the risk of a superinfection, a secondary infection in a patient having a preexisting
     infection. A superinfection develops when the antibacterial intended for the preexisting infection kills the protective
     microbiota, allowing another pathogen resistant to the antibacterial to proliferate and cause a secondary infection
     (Figure 14.6). Common examples of superinfections that develop as a result of antimicrobial usage include yeast
     infections (candidiasis) and pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, which can be fatal.

Dosage and Route of Administration

The amount of medication given during a certain time interval is the dosage, and it must be determined carefully to
ensure that optimum therapeutic drug levels are achieved at the site of infection without causing significant toxicity
(side effects) to the patient. Each drug class is associated with a variety of potential side effects, and some of these
are described for specific drugs later in this chapter. Despite best efforts to optimize dosing, allergic reactions and
other potentially serious side effects do occur. Therefore, the goal is to select the optimum dosage that will minimize
the risk of side effects while still achieving clinical cure, and there are important factors to consider when selecting
the best dose and dosage interval. For example, in children, dose is based upon the patient's mass. However, the
same is not true for adults and children 12 years of age and older, for which there is typically a single standard dose
regardless of the patient's mass. With the great variability in adult body mass, some experts have argued that mass
should be considered for all patients when determining appropriate dosage.8 An additional consideration is how
drugs are metabolized and eliminated from the body. In general, patients with a history of liver or kidney
dysfunction may experience reduced drug metabolism or clearance from the body, resulting in increased drug levels
that may lead to toxicity and make them more prone to side effects.

There are also some factors specific to the drugs themselves that influence appropriate dose and time interval
between doses. For example, the half-life, or rate at which 50% of a drug is eliminated from the plasma, can vary
significantly between drugs. Some drugs have a short half-life of only 1 hour and must be given multiple times a day,
whereas other drugs have half-lives exceeding 12 hours and can be given as a single dose every 24 hours. Although
a longer half-life can be considered an advantage for an antibacterial when it comes to convenient dosing intervals,
the longer half-life can also be a concern for a drug that has serious side effects because drug levels may remain
toxic for a longer time. Last, some drugs are dose dependent, meaning they are more effective when administered in
large doses to provide high levels for a short time at the site of infection. Others are time dependent, meaning they
are more effective when lower optimum levels are maintained over a longer period of time.

The route of administration, the method used to introduce a drug into the body, is also an important consideration
for drug therapy. Drugs that can be administered orally are generally preferred because patients can more
conveniently take these drugs at home. However, some drugs are not absorbed easily from the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract into the bloodstream. These drugs are often useful for treating diseases of the intestinal tract, such as
tapeworms treated with niclosamide, or for decontaminating the bowel, as with colistin. Some drugs that are not
absorbed easily, such as bacitracin, polymyxin, and several antifungals, are available as topical preparations for
treatment of superficial skin infections. Sometimes, patients may not initially be able to take oral medications
because of their illness (e.g., vomiting, intubation for respirator). When this occurs, and when a chosen drug is not
absorbed in the GI tract, administration of the drug by a parenteral route (intravenous or intramuscular injection) is
preferred and typically is performed in health-care settings. For most drugs, the plasma levels achieved by
intravenous administration is substantially higher than levels achieved by oral or intramuscular administration, and

     this can also be an important consideration when choosing the route of administration for treating an infection
     (Figure 14.7).

     FIGURE 14.7 On this graph, t0 represents the time at which a drug dose is administered. The curves illustrate how plasma concentration of
     the drug changes over specific intervals of time (t1 through t4). As the graph shows, when a drug is administered intravenously, the
     concentration peaks very quickly and then gradually decreases. When drugs are administered orally or intramuscularly, it takes longer for
     the concentration to reach its peak.

             side effects.

     Drug Interactions

     For the optimum treatment of some infections, two antibacterial drugs may be administered together to provide a
     synergistic interaction that is better than the efficacy of either drug alone. A classic example of synergistic
     combinations is trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). Individually, these two drugs provide only
     bacteriostatic inhibition of bacterial growth, but combined, the drugs are bactericidal.
     Whereas synergistic drug interactions provide a benefit to the patient, antagonistic interactions produce harmful
     effects. Antagonism can occur between two antimicrobials or between antimicrobials and nonantimicrobials being
     used to treat other conditions. The effects vary depending on the drugs involved, but antagonistic interactions may
     cause loss of drug activity, decreased therapeutic levels due to increased metabolism and elimination, or increased
     potential for toxicity due to decreased metabolism and elimination. As an example, some antibacterials are
     absorbed most effectively from the acidic environment of the stomach. If a patient takes antacids, however, this
     increases the pH of the stomach and negatively impacts the absorption of these antimicrobials, decreasing their
     effectiveness in treating an infection. Studies have also shown an association between use of some antimicrobials
     and failure of oral contraceptives.9

EYE ON ETHICS

Resistance Regulation

In the United States and many other countries, most antimicrobial drugs are self-administered by patients at
home. Unfortunately, many patients stop taking antimicrobials once their symptoms dissipate and they feel
better. If a 10-day course of treatment is prescribed, many patients only take the drug for 5 or 6 days, unaware
of the negative consequences of not completing the full course of treatment. A shorter course of treatment not
only fails to kill the target organisms to expected levels, it also selects for drug-resistant variants within the
target population and within the patient's microbiota.

Patients' nonadherence especially amplifies drug resistance when the recommended course of treatment is
long. Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is a case in point, with the recommended treatment lasting from 6 months
to a year. The CDC estimates that about one-third of the world's population is infected with TB, most living in
underdeveloped or underserved regions where antimicrobial drugs are available over the counter. In such
countries, there may be even lower rates of adherence than in developed areas. Nonadherence leads to
antibiotic resistance and more difficulty in controlling pathogens. As a direct result, the emergence of multidrug-
resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of TB is becoming a huge problem.

Overprescription of antimicrobials also contributes to antibiotic resistance. Patients often demand antibiotics for
diseases that do not require them, like viral colds and ear infections. Pharmaceutical companies aggressively
market drugs to physicians and clinics, making it easy for them to give free samples to patients, and some
pharmacies even offer certain antibiotics free to low-income patients with a prescription.

In recent years, various initiatives have aimed to educate parents and clinicians about the judicious use of
antibiotics. However, a recent study showed that, between 2000 and 2013, the parental expectation for
antimicrobial prescriptions for children actually increased (Figure 14.8).

One possible solution is a regimen called directly observed therapy (DOT), which involves the supervised
administration of medications to patients. Patients are either required to visit a health-care facility to receive
their medications, or health-care providers must administer medication in patients' homes or another
designated location. DOT has been implemented in many cases for the treatment of TB and has been shown to
be effective; indeed, DOT is an integral part of WHO's global strategy for eradicating TB.10 ,11 But is this a
practical strategy for all antibiotics? Would patients taking penicillin, for example, be more or less likely to
adhere to the full course of treatment if they had to travel to a health-care facility for each dose? And who would
pay for the increased cost associated with DOT? When it comes to overprescription, should someone be policing
physicians or drug companies to enforce best practices? What group should assume this responsibility, and what
penalties would be effective in discouraging overprescription?

     An important quality for an antimicrobial drug is selective toxicity, meaning that it selectively kills or inhibits the
     growth of microbial targets while causing minimal or no harm to the host. Most antimicrobial drugs currently in
     clinical use are antibacterial because the prokaryotic cell provides a greater variety of unique targets for selective
     toxicity, in comparison to fungi, parasites, and viruses. Each class of antibacterial drugs has a unique mode of action
     (the way in which a drug affects microbes at the cellular level), and these are summarized in Figure 14.9 and Table

     Inhibitors of Cell Wall Biosynthesis

     Several different classes of antibacterials block steps in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, making cells more
     susceptible to osmotic lysis (Table 14.2). Therefore, antibacterials that target cell wall biosynthesis are bactericidal
     in their action. Because human cells do not make peptidoglycan, this mode of action is an excellent example of
     selective toxicity.

     Penicillin, the first antibiotic discovered, is one of several antibacterials within a class called -lactams. This group
     of compounds includes the penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems, and is characterized by
     the presence of a -lactam ring found within the central structure of the drug molecule (Figure 14.10). The -lactam
     antibacterials block the crosslinking of peptide chains during the biosynthesis of new peptidoglycan in the bacterial
     cell wall. They are able to block this process because the -lactam structure is similar to the structure of the
     peptidoglycan subunit component that is recognized by the crosslinking transpeptidase enzyme, also known as a
     penicillin-binding protein (PBP). Although the -lactam ring must remain unchanged for these drugs to retain their
     antibacterial activity, strategic chemical changes to the R groups have allowed for development of a wide variety of
     semisynthetic -lactam drugs with increased potency, expanded spectrum of activity, and longer half-lives for
     better dosing, among other characteristics.

     Penicillin G and penicillin V are natural antibiotics from fungi and are primarily active against gram-positive bacterial
     pathogens, and a few gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as Pasteurella multocida. Figure 14.10 summarizes
     the semisynthetic development of some of the penicillins. Adding an amino group (-NH2) to penicillin G created the
     aminopenicillins (i.e., ampicillin and amoxicillin) that have increased spectrum of activity against more gram-
     negative pathogens. Furthermore, the addition of a hydroxyl group (-OH) to amoxicillin increased acid stability,
     which allows for improved oral absorption. Methicillin is a semisynthetic penicillin that was developed to address
     the spread of enzymes (penicillinases) that were inactivating the other penicillins. Changing the R group of penicillin
     G to the more bulky dimethoxyphenyl group provided protection of the -lactam ring from enzymatic destruction by
     penicillinases, giving us the first penicillinase-resistant penicillin.

     Similar to the penicillins, cephalosporins contain a -lactam ring (Figure 14.10) and block the transpeptidase
     activity of penicillin-binding proteins. However, the -lactam ring of cephalosporins is fused to a six-member ring,
     rather than the five-member ring found in penicillins. This chemical difference provides cephalosporins with an
     increased resistance to enzymatic inactivation by -lactamases. The drug cephalosporin C was originally isolated
     from the fungus Cephalosporium acremonium in the 1950s and has a similar spectrum of activity to that of penicillin
     against gram-positive bacteria but is active against more gram-negative bacteria than penicillin. Another important
     structural difference is that cephalosporin C possesses two R groups, compared with just one R group for penicillin,
     and this provides for greater diversity in chemical alterations and development of semisynthetic cephalosporins.
     The family of semisynthetic cephalosporins is much larger than the penicillins, and these drugs have been classified
     into generations based primarily on their spectrum of activity, increasing in spectrum from the narrow-spectrum,
     first-generation cephalosporins to the broad-spectrum, fourth-generation cephalosporins. A new fifth-generation
     cephalosporin has been developed that is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

     The carbapenems and monobactams also have a -lactam ring as part of their core structure, and they inhibit the
     transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding proteins. The only monobactam used clinically is aztreonam. It is a
     narrow-spectrum antibacterial with activity only against gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, the carbapenem family

includes a variety of semisynthetic drugs (imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem) that provide very broad-
spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

The drug vancomycin, a member of a class of compounds called the glycopeptides, was discovered in the 1950s as
a natural antibiotic from the actinomycete Amycolatopsis orientalis. Similar to the -lactams, vancomycin inhibits
cell wall biosynthesis and is bactericidal. However, in contrast to the -lactams, the structure of vancomycin is not
similar to that of cell-wall peptidoglycan subunits and does not directly inactivate penicillin-binding proteins. Rather,
vancomycin is a very large, complex molecule that binds to the end of the peptide chain of cell wall precursors,
creating a structural blockage that prevents the cell wall subunits from being incorporated into the growing N-
acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM-NAG) backbone of the peptidoglycan structure
(transglycosylation). Vancomycin also structurally blocks transpeptidation. Vancomycin is bactericidal against gram-
positive bacterial pathogens, but it is not active against gram-negative bacteria because of its inability to penetrate
the protective outer membrane.

The drug bacitracin consists of a group of structurally similar peptide antibiotics originally isolated from Bacillus
subtilis. Bacitracin blocks the activity of a specific cell-membrane molecule that is responsible for the movement of
peptidoglycan precursors from the cytoplasm to the exterior of the cell, ultimately preventing their incorporation
into the cell wall. Bacitracin is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including gram-positive organisms found on
the skin, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Although it may be administered orally or intramuscularly in
some circumstances, bacitracin has been shown to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys). Therefore, it is more
commonly combined with neomycin and polymyxin in topical ointments such as Neosporin.

FIGURE 14.10 Penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems all contain a -lactam ring, the site of attack by inactivating -
lactamase enzymes. Although they all share the same nucleus, various penicillins differ from each other in the structure of their R groups.
Chemical changes to the R groups provided increased spectrum of activity, acid stability, and resistance to -lactamase degradation.

Inhibitors of Protein Biosynthesis

The cytoplasmic ribosomes found in animal cells (80S) are structurally distinct from those found in bacterial cells
(70S), making protein biosynthesis a good selective target for antibacterial drugs. Several types of protein
biosynthesis inhibitors are discussed in this section and are summarized in Figure 14.11.

Protein Synthesis Inhibitors That Bind the 30S Subunit
Aminoglycosides are large, highly polar antibacterial drugs that bind to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes,
impairing the proofreading ability of the ribosomal complex. This impairment causes mismatches between codons
and anticodons, resulting in the production of proteins with incorrect amino acids and shortened proteins that insert
into the cytoplasmic membrane. Disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane by the faulty proteins kills the bacterial
cells. The aminoglycosides, which include drugs such as streptomycin, gentamicin, neomycin, and kanamycin, are
potent broad-spectrum antibacterials. However, aminoglycosides have been shown to be nephrotoxic (damaging to
kidney), neurotoxic (damaging to the nervous system), and ototoxic (damaging to the ear).

Another class of antibacterial compounds that bind to the 30S subunit is the tetracyclines. In contrast to
aminoglycosides, these drugs are bacteriostatic and inhibit protein synthesis by blocking the association of tRNAs
with the ribosome during translation. Naturally occurring tetracyclines produced by various strains of Streptomyces
were first discovered in the 1940s, and several semisynthetic tetracyclines, including doxycycline and tigecycline
have also been produced. Although the tetracyclines are broad spectrum in their coverage of bacterial pathogens,
side effects that can limit their use include phototoxicity, permanent discoloration of developing teeth, and liver
toxicity with high doses or in patients with kidney impairment.

Protein Synthesis Inhibitors That Bind the 50S Subunit
There are several classes of antibacterial drugs that work through binding to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.
The macrolide antibacterial drugs have a large, complex ring structure and are part of a larger class of naturally
556  14 · Antimicrobial Drugs

     produced secondary metabolites called polyketides, complex compounds produced in a stepwise fashion through
     the repeated addition of two-carbon units by a mechanism similar to that used for fatty acid synthesis. Macrolides
     are broad-spectrum, bacteriostatic drugs that block elongation of proteins by inhibiting peptide bond formation
     between specific combinations of amino acids. The first macrolide was erythromycin. It was isolated in 1952 from
     Streptomyces erythreus and prevents translocation. Semisynthetic macrolides include azithromycin and
     telithromycin. Compared with erythromycin, azithromycin has a broader spectrum of activity, fewer side effects,
     and a significantly longer half-life (1.5 hours for erythromycin versus 68 hours for azithromycin) that allows for
     once-daily dosing and a short 3-day course of therapy (i.e., Zpac formulation) for most infections. Telithromycin is
     the first semisynthetic within the class known as ketolides. Although telithromycin shows increased potency and
     activity against macrolide-resistant pathogens, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited its use to
     treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and requires the strongest "black box warning" label for the drug
     because of serious hepatotoxicity.

     The lincosamides include the naturally produced lincomycin and semisynthetic clindamycin. Although structurally
     distinct from macrolides, lincosamides are similar in their mode of action to the macrolides through binding to the
     50S ribosomal subunit and preventing peptide bond formation. Lincosamides are particularly active against
     streptococcal and staphylococcal infections.

     The drug chloramphenicol represents yet another structurally distinct class of antibacterials that also bind to the
     50S ribosome, inhibiting peptide bond formation. Chloramphenicol, produced by Streptomyces venezuelae, was
     discovered in 1947; in 1949, it became the first broad-spectrum antibiotic that was approved by the FDA. Although
     it is a natural antibiotic, it is also easily synthesized and was the first antibacterial drug synthetically mass produced.
     As a result of its mass production, broad-spectrum coverage, and ability to penetrate into tissues efficiently,
     chloramphenicol was historically used to treat a wide range of infections, from meningitis to typhoid fever to
     conjunctivitis. Unfortunately, serious side effects, such as lethal gray baby syndrome, and suppression of bone
     marrow production, have limited its clinical role. Chloramphenicol also causes anemia in two different ways. One
     mechanism involves the targeting of mitochondrial ribosomes within hematopoietic stem cells, causing a reversible,
     dose-dependent suppression of blood cell production. Once chloramphenicol dosing is discontinued, blood cell
     production returns to normal. This mechanism highlights the similarity between 70S ribosomes of bacteria and the
     70S ribosomes within our mitochondria. The second mechanism of anemia is idiosyncratic (i.e., the mechanism is
     not understood), and involves an irreversible lethal loss of blood cell production known as aplastic anemia. This
     mechanism of aplastic anemia is not dose dependent and can develop after therapy has stopped. Because of
     toxicity concerns, chloramphenicol usage in humans is now rare in the United States and is limited to severe
     infections unable to be treated by less toxic antibiotics. Because its side effects are much less severe in animals, it
     is used in veterinary medicine.

     The oxazolidinones, including linezolid, are a new broad-spectrum class of synthetic protein synthesis inhibitors
     that bind to the 50S ribosomal subunit of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, their
     mechanism of action seems somewhat different from that of the other 50S subunit-binding protein synthesis
     inhibitors already discussed. Instead, they seem to interfere with formation of the initiation complex (association of
     the 50S subunit, 30S subunit, and other factors) for translation, and they prevent translocation of the growing
     protein from the ribosomal A site to the P site. Table 14.3 summarizes the protein synthesis inhibitors.

     Inhibitors of Membrane Function

     A small group of antibacterials target the bacterial membrane as their mode of action (Table 14.4). The polymyxins
     are natural polypeptide antibiotics that were first discovered in 1947 as products of Bacillus polymyxa; only
     polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin) have been used clinically. They are lipophilic with detergent-like properties
     and interact with the lipopolysaccharide component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, ultimately
     disrupting both their outer and inner membranes and killing the bacterial cells. Unfortunately, the membrane-
     targeting mechanism is not a selective toxicity, and these drugs also target and damage the membrane of cells in
     the kidney and nervous system when administered systemically. Because of these serious side effects and their
     poor absorption from the digestive tract, polymyxin B is used in over-the-counter topical antibiotic ointments (e.g.,
     Neosporin), and oral colistin was historically used only for bowel decontamination to prevent infections originating
     from bowel microbes in immunocompromised patients or for those undergoing certain abdominal surgeries.
     However, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens has led to increased use of intravenous
     colistin in hospitals, often as a drug of last resort to treat serious infections. The antibacterial daptomycin is a cyclic
     lipopeptide produced by Streptomyces roseosporus that seems to work like the polymyxins, inserting in the
     bacterial cell membrane and disrupting it. However, in contrast to polymyxin B and colistin, which target only gram-
     negative bacteria, daptomycin specifically targets gram-positive bacteria. It is typically administered intravenously
     and seems to be well tolerated, showing reversible toxicity in skeletal muscles.

Inhibitors of Nucleic Acid Synthesis

Some antibacterial drugs work by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis (Table 14.5). For example, metronidazole is a
semisynthetic member of the nitroimidazole family that is also an antiprotozoan. It interferes with DNA replication in
target cells. The drug rifampin is a semisynthetic member of the rifamycin family and functions by blocking RNA
polymerase activity in bacteria. The RNA polymerase enzymes in bacteria are structurally different from those in
eukaryotes, providing for selective toxicity against bacterial cells. It is used for the treatment of a variety of
infections, but its primary use, often in a cocktail with other antibacterial drugs, is against mycobacteria that cause
tuberculosis. Despite the selectivity of its mechanism, rifampin can induce liver enzymes to increase metabolism of
other drugs being administered (antagonism), leading to hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) and negatively influencing the
bioavailability and therapeutic effect of the companion drugs.

One member of the quinolone family, a group of synthetic antimicrobials, is nalidixic acid. It was discovered in
1962 as a byproduct during the synthesis of chloroquine, an antimalarial drug. Nalidixic acid selectively inhibits the
activity of bacterial DNA gyrase, blocking DNA replication. Chemical modifications to the original quinolone
backbone have resulted in the production of fluoroquinolones, like ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, which also inhibit
the activity of DNA gyrase. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive or
gram-negative bacteria, and are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics used to treat a wide range of
infections, including urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, abdominal infections, and skin infections.
However, despite their selective toxicity against DNA gyrase, side effects associated with different fluoroquinolones
include phototoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, glucose metabolism dysfunction, and increased risk for tendon
rupture.

     Inhibitors of Metabolic Pathways

     Some synthetic drugs control bacterial infections by functioning as antimetabolites, competitive inhibitors for
     bacterial metabolic enzymes (Table 14.6). The sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) are the oldest synthetic antibacterial
     agents and are structural analogues of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an early intermediate in folic acid synthesis
     (Figure 14.12). By inhibiting the enzyme involved in the production of dihydrofolic acid, sulfonamides block bacterial
     biosynthesis of folic acid and, subsequently, pyrimidines and purines required for nucleic acid synthesis. This
     mechanism of action provides bacteriostatic inhibition of growth against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and
     gram-negative pathogens. Because humans obtain folic acid from food instead of synthesizing it intracellularly,
     sulfonamides are selectively toxic for bacteria. However, allergic reactions to sulfa drugs are common. The sulfones
     are structurally similar to sulfonamides but are not commonly used today except for the treatment of Hansen's
     disease (leprosy).

     Trimethoprim is a synthetic antimicrobial compound that serves as an antimetabolite within the same folic acid
     synthesis pathway as sulfonamides. However, trimethoprim is a structural analogue of dihydrofolic acid and inhibits
     a later step in the metabolic pathway (Figure 14.12). Trimethoprim is used in combination with the sulfa drug
     sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infections, ear infections, and bronchitis. As discussed, the combination of
     trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is an example of antibacterial synergy. When used alone, each antimetabolite
     only decreases production of folic acid to a level where bacteriostatic inhibition of growth occurs. However, when
     used in combination, inhibition of both steps in the metabolic pathway decreases folic acid synthesis to a level that
     is lethal to the bacterial cell. Because of the importance of folic acid during fetal development, sulfa drugs and
     trimethoprim use should be carefully considered during early pregnancy.

     The drug isoniazid is an antimetabolite with specific toxicity for mycobacteria and has long been used in
     combination with rifampin or streptomycin in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is administered as a prodrug,
     requiring activation through the action of an intracellular bacterial peroxidase enzyme, forming isoniazid-
     nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and isoniazid-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP),
     ultimately preventing the synthesis of mycolic acid, which is essential for mycobacterial cell walls. Possible side
     effects of isoniazid use include hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hematologic toxicity (anemia).

     Inhibitor of ATP Synthase

     Bedaquiline, representing the synthetic antibacterial class of compounds called the diarylquinolines, uses a novel
     mode of action that specifically inhibits mycobacterial growth. Although the specific mechanism has yet to be
     elucidated, this compound appears to interfere with the function of ATP synthases, perhaps by interfering with the
     use of the hydrogen ion gradient for ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation, leading to reduced ATP production.
     Due to its side effects, including hepatotoxicity and potentially lethal heart arrhythmia, its use is reserved for
     serious, otherwise untreatable cases of tuberculosis.

14.4 Mechanisms of Other Antimicrobial Drugs

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
    · Explain the differences between modes of action of drugs that target fungi, protozoa, helminths, and
        viruses

Because fungi, protozoa, and helminths are eukaryotic, their cells are very similar to human cells, making it more
difficult to develop drugs with selective toxicity. Additionally, viruses replicate within human host cells, making it
difficult to develop drugs that are selectively toxic to viruses or virus-infected cells. Despite these challenges, there
are antimicrobial drugs that target fungi, protozoa, helminths, and viruses, and some even target more than one type
of microbe. Table 14.7, Table 14.8, Table 14.9, and Table 14.10 provide examples for antimicrobial drugs in these
various classes.

Antifungal Drugs

The most common mode of action for antifungal drugs is the disruption of the cell membrane. Antifungals take
advantage of small differences between fungi and humans in the biochemical pathways that synthesize sterols. The
sterols are important in maintaining proper membrane fluidity and, hence, proper function of the cell membrane. For
most fungi, the predominant membrane sterol is ergosterol. Because human cell membranes use cholesterol,
instead of ergosterol, antifungal drugs that target ergosterol synthesis are selectively toxic (Figure 14.13).

FIGURE 14.13 The predominant sterol found in human cells is cholesterol, whereas the predominant sterol found in fungi is ergosterol,
making ergosterol a good target for antifungal drug development.

The imidazoles are synthetic fungicides that disrupt ergosterol biosynthesis; they are commonly used in medical
applications and also in agriculture to keep seeds and harvested crops from molding. Examples include miconazole,
ketoconazole, and clotrimazole, which are used to treat fungal skin infections such as ringworm, specifically tinea
pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), and tinea corporis. These infections are commonly caused by
dermatophytes of the genera Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum. Miconazole is also used
predominantly for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections caused by the fungus Candida, and ketoconazole is used
for the treatment of tinea versicolor and dandruff, which both can be caused by the fungus Malassezia.

The triazole drugs, including fluconazole, also inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis. However, they can be administered
orally or intravenously for the treatment of several types of systemic yeast infections, including oral thrush and
cryptococcal meningitis, both of which are prevalent in patients with AIDS. The triazoles also exhibit more selective
toxicity, compared with the imidazoles, and are associated with fewer side effects.

The allylamines, a structurally different class of synthetic antifungal drugs, inhibit an earlier step in ergosterol
biosynthesis. The most commonly used allylamine is terbinafine (marketed under the brand name Lamisil), which is
used topically for the treatment of dermatophytic skin infections like athlete's foot, ringworm, and jock itch. Oral
treatment with terbinafine is also used for the treatment of fingernail and toenail fungus, but it can be associated
with the rare side effect of hepatotoxicity.

The polyenes are a class of antifungal agents naturally produced by certain actinomycete soil bacteria and are
structurally related to macrolides. These large, lipophilic molecules bind to ergosterol in fungal cytoplasmic
membranes, thus creating pores. Common examples include nystatin and amphotericin B. Nystatin is typically used
as a topical treatment for yeast infections of the skin, mouth, and vagina, but may also be used for intestinal fungal
564  14 · Antimicrobial Drugs

     infections. The drug amphotericin B is used for systemic fungal infections like aspergillosis, cryptococcal
     meningitis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and candidiasis. Amphotericin B was the only antifungal drug available
     for several decades, but its use is associated with some serious side effects, including nephrotoxicity (kidney
     toxicity).

     Amphotericin B is often used in combination with flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine analog that is converted by a
     fungal-specific enzyme into a toxic product that interferes with both DNA replication and protein synthesis in fungi.
     Flucytosine is also associated with hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) and bone marrow depression.

     Beyond targeting ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, there are a few antifungal drugs that target other fungal
     structures (Figure 14.14). The echinocandins, including caspofungin, are a group of naturally produced antifungal
     compounds that block the synthesis of (13) glucan found in fungal cell walls but not found in human cells. This
     drug class has the nickname "penicillin for fungi." Caspofungin is used for the treatment of aspergillosis as well as
     systemic yeast infections.

     Although chitin is only a minor constituent of fungal cell walls, it is also absent in human cells, making it a selective
     target. The polyoxins and nikkomycins are naturally produced antifungals that target chitin synthesis. Polyoxins are
     used to control fungi for agricultural purposes, and nikkomycin Z is currently under development for use in humans
     to treat yeast infections and Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis), a fungal disease prevalent in the southwestern US.13

     The naturally produced antifungal griseofulvin is thought to specifically disrupt fungal cell division by interfering with
     microtubules involved in spindle formation during mitosis. It was one of the first antifungals, but its use is
     associated with hepatotoxicity. It is typically administered orally to treat various types of dermatophytic skin
     infections when other topical antifungal treatments are ineffective.

     There are a few drugs that act as antimetabolites against fungal processes. For example, atovaquone, a
     representative of the naphthoquinone drug class, is a semisynthetic antimetabolite for fungal and protozoal versions
     of a mitochondrial cytochrome important in electron transport. Structurally, it is an analog of coenzyme Q, with
     which it competes for electron binding. It is particularly useful for the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia
     caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. The antibacterial sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination also acts as an
     antimetabolite against P. jirovecii.

     Table 14.7 shows the various therapeutic classes of antifungal drugs, categorized by mode of action, with examples
     of each.

     CASE IN POINT

     Treating a Fungal Infection of the Lungs

     Jack, a 48-year-old engineer, is HIV positive but generally healthy thanks to antiretroviral therapy (ART).
     However, after a particularly intense week at work, he developed a fever and a dry cough. He assumed that he
     just had a cold or mild flu due to overexertion and didn't think much of it. However, after about a week, he began
     to experience fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath. He decided to visit his physician, who found that
     Jack had a low level of blood oxygenation. The physician ordered blood testing, a chest X-ray, and the collection
     of an induced sputum sample for analysis. His X-ray showed a fine cloudiness and several pneumatoceles (thin-
     walled pockets of air), which indicated Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a type of pneumonia caused by the
     fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Jack's physician admitted him to the hospital and prescribed Bactrim, a
     combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, to be administered intravenously.

     P. jirovecii is a yeast-like fungus with a life cycle similar to that of protozoans. As such, it was classified as a
     protozoan until the 1980s. It lives only in the lung tissue of infected persons and is transmitted from person to
     person, with many people exposed as children. Typically, P. jirovecii only causes pneumonia in
     immunocompromised individuals. Healthy people may carry the fungus in their lungs with no symptoms of
     disease. PCP is particularly problematic among HIV patients with compromised immune systems.

     PCP is usually treated with oral or intravenous Bactrim, but atovaquone or pentamidine (another antiparasitic
     drug) are alternatives. If not treated, PCP can progress, leading to a collapsed lung and nearly 100% mortality.
     Even with antimicrobial drug therapy, PCP still is responsible for 10% of HIV-related deaths.

     The cytological examination, using direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA), of a smear from Jack's sputum
     sample confirmed the presence of P. jirovecii (Figure 14.15). Additionally, the results of Jack's blood tests
     revealed that his white blood cell count had dipped, making him more susceptible to the fungus. His physician
     reviewed his ART regimen and made adjustments. After a few days of hospitalization, Jack was released to
     continue his antimicrobial therapy at home. With the adjustments to his ART therapy, Jack's CD4 counts began
     to increase and he was able to go back to work.

Antiprotozoan Drugs

There are a few mechanisms by which antiprotozoan drugs target infectious protozoans (Table 14.9). Some are
antimetabolites, such as atovaquone, proguanil, and artemisinins. Atovaquone, in addition to being antifungal,
blocks electron transport in protozoans and is used for the treatment of protozoan infections including malaria,
babesiosis, and toxoplasmosis. Proguanil is another synthetic antimetabolite that is processed in parasitic cells into
its active form, which inhibits protozoan folic acid synthesis. It is often used in combination with atovaquone, and
the combination is marketed as Malarone for both malaria treatment and prevention.

Artemisinin, a plant-derived antifungal first discovered by Tu Youyou and other Chinese scientists in the 1970s, is
quite effective against malaria. Semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin are more water soluble than the natural
version, which makes them more bioavailable. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, artemisinins
appear to act as prodrugs that are metabolized by target cells to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that
damage target cells. Due to the rise in resistance to antimalarial drugs, artemisinins are also commonly used in
combination with other antimalarial compounds in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).

Several antimetabolites are used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The
synthetic sulfa drug sulfadiazine competitively inhibits an enzyme in folic acid production in parasites and can be
used to treat malaria and toxoplasmosis. Pyrimethamine is a synthetic drug that inhibits a different enzyme in the
folic acid production pathway and is often used in combination with sulfadoxine (another sulfa drug) for the
treatment of malaria or in combination with sulfadiazine for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Side effects of
pyrimethamine include decreased bone marrow activity that may cause increased bruising and low red blood cell
counts. When toxicity is a concern, spiramycin, a macrolide protein synthesis inhibitor, is typically administered for
the treatment of toxoplasmosis.

Two classes of antiprotozoan drugs interfere with nucleic acid synthesis: nitroimidazoles and quinolines.
Nitroimidazoles, including semisynthetic metronidazole, which was discussed previously as an antibacterial drug,
and synthetic tinidazole, are useful in combating a wide variety of protozoan pathogens, such as Giardia lamblia,
Entamoeba histolytica, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Upon introduction into these cells in low-oxygen environments,
nitroimidazoles become activated and introduce DNA strand breakage, interfering with DNA replication in target
cells. Unfortunately, metronidazole is associated with carcinogenesis (the development of cancer) in humans.

Another type of synthetic antiprotozoan drug that has long been thought to specifically interfere with DNA
replication in certain pathogens is pentamidine. It has historically been used for the treatment of African sleeping
sickness (caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei) and leishmaniasis (caused by protozoa of the genus
Leishmania), but it is also an alternative treatment for the fungus Pneumocystis. Some studies indicate that it
specifically binds to the DNA found within kinetoplasts (kDNA; long mitochondrion-like structures unique to
trypanosomes), leading to the cleavage of kDNA. However, nuclear DNA of both the parasite and host remain
unaffected. It also appears to bind to tRNA, inhibiting the addition of amino acids to tRNA, thus preventing protein
568  14 · Antimicrobial Drugs

     synthesis. Possible side effects of pentamidine use include pancreatic dysfunction and liver damage.

     The quinolines are a class of synthetic compounds related to quinine, which has a long history of use against
     malaria. Quinolines are thought to interfere with heme detoxification, which is necessary for the parasite's effective
     breakdown of hemoglobin into amino acids inside red blood cells. The synthetic derivatives chloroquine, quinacrine
     (also called mepacrine), and mefloquine are commonly used as antimalarials, and chloroquine is also used to treat
     amebiasis typically caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Long-term prophylactic use of chloroquine or mefloquine may
     result in serious side effects, including hallucinations or cardiac issues. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate
     dehydrogenase deficiency experience severe anemia when treated with chloroquine.

Antihelminthic Drugs

Because helminths are multicellular eukaryotes like humans, developing drugs with selective toxicity against them
is extremely challenging. Despite this, several effective classes have been developed (Table 14.9). Synthetic
benzimidazoles, like mebendazole and albendazole, bind to helminthic -tubulin, preventing microtubule
formation. Microtubules in the intestinal cells of the worms seem to be particularly affected, leading to a reduction
in glucose uptake. Besides their activity against a broad range of helminths, benzimidazoles are also active against
many protozoans, fungi, and viruses, and their use for inhibiting mitosis and cell cycle progression in cancer cells is
under study.14 Possible side effects of their use include liver damage and bone marrow suppression.

The avermectins are members of the macrolide family that were first discovered from a Japanese soil isolate,
Streptomyces avermectinius. A more potent semisynthetic derivative of avermectin is ivermectin, which binds to
glutamate-gated chloride channels specific to invertebrates including helminths, blocking neuronal transmission
and causing starvation, paralysis, and death of the worms. Ivermectin is used to treat roundworm diseases,
including onchocerciasis (also called river blindness, caused by the worm Onchocerca volvulus) and strongyloidiasis
(caused by the worm Strongyloides stercoralis or S. fuelleborni). Ivermectin also can also treat parasitic insects like
mites, lice, and bed bugs, and is nontoxic to humans.

Niclosamide is a synthetic drug that has been used for over 50 years to treat tapeworm infections. Although its
mode of action is not entirely clear, niclosamide appears to inhibit ATP formation under anaerobic conditions and
inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of its target pathogens. Niclosamide is not absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract, thus it can achieve high localized intestinal concentrations in patients. Recently, it has been
shown to also have antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activities.15 16 17

Another synthetic antihelminthic drug is praziquantel, which used for the treatment of parasitic tapeworms and
liver flukes, and is particularly useful for the treatment of schistosomiasis (caused by blood flukes from three genera
of Schistosoma). Its mode of action remains unclear, but it appears to cause the influx of calcium into the worm,
resulting in intense spasm and paralysis of the worm. It is often used as a preferred alternative to niclosamide in the
treatment of tapeworms when gastrointestinal discomfort limits niclosamide use.

The thioxanthenones, another class of synthetic drugs structurally related to quinine, exhibit antischistosomal
activity by inhibiting RNA synthesis. The thioxanthenone lucanthone and its metabolite hycanthone were the first
used clinically, but serious neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and hepatic side effects led to their
discontinuation. Oxamniquine, a less toxic derivative of hycanthone, is only effective against S. mansoni, one of the
three species known to cause schistosomiasis in humans. Praziquantel was developed to target the other two
schistosome species, but concerns about increasing resistance have renewed interest in developing additional
derivatives of oxamniquine to target all three clinically important schistosome species.

     · Why are antihelminthic drugs difficult to develop?

     Antiviral Drugs

     Unlike the complex structure of fungi, protozoa, and helminths, viral structure is simple, consisting of nucleic acid, a
     protein coat, viral enzymes, and, sometimes, a lipid envelope. Furthermore, viruses are obligate intracellular
     pathogens that use the host's cellular machinery to replicate. These characteristics make it difficult to develop
     drugs with selective toxicity against viruses.

     Many antiviral drugs are nucleoside analogs and function by inhibiting nucleic acid biosynthesis. For example,
     acyclovir (marketed as Zovirax) is a synthetic analog of the nucleoside guanosine (Figure 14.16). It is activated by
     the herpes simplex viral enzyme thymidine kinase and, when added to a growing DNA strand during replication,
     causes chain termination. Its specificity for virus-infected cells comes from both the need for a viral enzyme to
     activate it and the increased affinity of the activated form for viral DNA polymerase compared to host cell DNA
     polymerase. Acyclovir and its derivatives are frequently used for the treatment of herpes virus infections, including
     genital herpes, chickenpox, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus infections, and cytomegalovirus infections. Acyclovir can be
     administered either topically or systemically, depending on the infection. One possible side effect of its use includes
     nephrotoxicity. The drug adenine-arabinoside, marketed as vidarabine, is a synthetic analog to deoxyadenosine that
     has a mechanism of action similar to that of acyclovir. It is also effective for the treatment of various human herpes
     viruses. However, because of possible side effects involving low white blood cell counts and neurotoxicity,
     treatment with acyclovir is now preferred.

     Ribavirin, another synthetic guanosine analog, works by a mechanism of action that is not entirely clear. It appears
     to interfere with both DNA and RNA synthesis, perhaps by reducing intracellular pools of guanosine triphosphate
     (GTP). Ribavarin also appears to inhibit the RNA polymerase of hepatitis C virus. It is primarily used for the
     treatment of the RNA viruses like hepatitis C (in combination therapy with interferon) and respiratory syncytial virus.
     Possible side effects of ribavirin use include anemia and developmental effects on unborn children in pregnant
     patients. In recent years, another nucleotide analog, sofosbuvir (Solvaldi), has also been developed for the
     treatment of hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir is a uridine analog that interferes with viral polymerase activity. It is commonly
     coadministered with ribavirin, with and without interferon.

Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis is not the only target of synthetic antivirals. Although the mode of action of
amantadine and its relative rimantadine are not entirely clear, these drugs appear to bind to a transmembrane
protein that is involved in the escape of the influenza virus from endosomes. Blocking escape of the virus also
prevents viral RNA release into host cells and subsequent viral replication. Increasing resistance has limited the use
of amantadine and rimantadine in the treatment of influenza A. Use of amantadine can result in neurological side
effects, but the side effects of rimantadine seem less severe. Interestingly, because of their effects on brain
chemicals such as dopamine and NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate), amantadine and rimantadine are also used for the
treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Neuraminidase inhibitors, including olsetamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), and peramivir (Rapivab), specifically
target influenza viruses by blocking the activity of influenza virus neuraminidase, preventing the release of the virus
from infected cells. These three antivirals can decrease flu symptoms and shorten the duration of illness, but they
differ in their modes of administration: olsetamivir is administered orally, zanamivir is inhaled, and peramivir is
administered intravenously. Resistance to these neuraminidase inhibitors still seems to be minimal.

Pleconaril is a synthetic antiviral under development that showed promise for the treatment of picornaviruses. Use
of pleconaril for the treatment of the common cold caused by rhinoviruses was not approved by the FDA in 2002
because of lack of proven effectiveness, lack of stability, and association with irregular menstruation. Its further
development for this purpose was halted in 2007. However, pleconaril is still being investigated for use in the
treatment of life-threatening complications of enteroviruses, such as meningitis and sepsis. It is also being
investigated for use in the global eradication of a specific enterovirus, polio.18 Pleconaril seems to work by binding
to the viral capsid and preventing the uncoating of viral particles inside host cells during viral infection.

Viruses with complex life cycles, such as HIV, can be more difficult to treat. First, HIV targets CD4-positive white
blood cells, which are necessary for a normal immune response to infection. Second, HIV is a retrovirus, meaning
that it converts its RNA genome into a DNA copy that integrates into the host cell's genome, thus hiding within host
cell DNA. Third, the HIV reverse transcriptase lacks proofreading activity and introduces mutations that allow for
rapid development of antiviral drug resistance. To help prevent the emergence of resistance, a combination of
specific synthetic antiviral drugs is typically used in ART for HIV (Figure 14.17).

The reverse transcriptase inhibitors block the early step of converting viral RNA genome into DNA, and can include
competitive nucleoside analog inhibitors (e.g., azidothymidine/zidovudine, or AZT) and non-nucleoside
noncompetitive inhibitors (e.g., etravirine) that bind reverse transcriptase and cause an inactivating conformational
change. Drugs called protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) block the processing of viral proteins and prevent viral
maturation. Protease inhibitors are also being developed for the treatment of other viral types.19 For example,
simeprevir (Olysio) has been approved for the treatment of hepatitis C and is administered with ribavirin and
interferon in combination therapy. The integrase inhibitors (e.g., raltegravir), block the activity of the HIV integrase
responsible for the recombination of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome. Additional drug
classes for HIV treatment include the CCR5 antagonists and the fusion inhibitors (e.g., enfuviritide), which prevent
the binding of HIV to the host cell coreceptor (chemokine receptor type 5 [CCR5]) and the merging of the viral
envelope with the host cell membrane, respectively. Table 14.10 shows the various therapeutic classes of antiviral
drugs, categorized by mode of action, with examples of each.

     14.5 Drug Resistance

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the concept of drug resistance
         · Describe how microorganisms develop or acquire drug resistance
         · Describe the different mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance

     Antimicrobial resistance is not a new phenomenon. In nature, microbes are constantly evolving in order to overcome
     the antimicrobial compounds produced by other microorganisms. Human development of antimicrobial drugs and
     their widespread clinical use has simply provided another selective pressure that promotes further evolution.
     Several important factors can accelerate the evolution of drug resistance. These include the overuse and misuse of
     antimicrobials, inappropriate use of antimicrobials, subtherapeutic dosing, and patient noncompliance with the
     recommended course of treatment.

     Exposure of a pathogen to an antimicrobial compound can select for chromosomal mutations conferring resistance,
     which can be transferred vertically to subsequent microbial generations and eventually become predominant in a
     microbial population that is repeatedly exposed to the antimicrobial. Alternatively, many genes responsible for drug
     resistance are found on plasmids or in transposons that can be transferred easily between microbes through
     horizontal gene transfer (see How Asexual Prokaryotes Achieve Genetic Diversity). Transposons also have the ability
     to move resistance genes between plasmids and chromosomes to further promote the spread of resistance.

     Mechanisms for Drug Resistance

     There are several common mechanisms for drug resistance, which are summarized in Figure 14.18. These

mechanisms include enzymatic modification of the drug, modification of the antimicrobial target, and prevention of
drug penetration or accumulation.

FIGURE 14.18 There are multiple strategies that microbes use to develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs. (Not shown: target
overproduction, target mimicry, and enzymatic bypass). (credit: modification of work by Gerard D Wright)

Drug Modification or Inactivation
Resistance genes may code for enzymes that chemically modify an antimicrobial, thereby inactivating it, or destroy
an antimicrobial through hydrolysis. Resistance to many types of antimicrobials occurs through this mechanism. For
example, aminoglycoside resistance can occur through enzymatic transfer of chemical groups to the drug molecule,
impairing the binding of the drug to its bacterial target. For -lactams, bacterial resistance can involve the enzymatic
hydrolysis of the -lactam bond within the -lactam ring of the drug molecule. Once the -lactam bond is broken,
the drug loses its antibacterial activity. This mechanism of resistance is mediated by -lactamases, which are the
most common mechanism of -lactam resistance. Inactivation of rifampin commonly occurs through glycosylation,
phosphorylation, or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation, and resistance to macrolides and lincosamides can
also occur due to enzymatic inactivation of the drug or modification.

Prevention of Cellular Uptake or Efflux
Microbes may develop resistance mechanisms that involve inhibiting the accumulation of an antimicrobial drug,
which then prevents the drug from reaching its cellular target. This strategy is common among gram-negative
pathogens and can involve changes in outer membrane lipid composition, porin channel selectivity, and/or porin
channel concentrations. For example, a common mechanism of carbapenem resistance among Pseudomonas
aeruginosa is to decrease the amount of its OprD porin, which is the primary portal of entry for carbapenems
through the outer membrane of this pathogen. Additionally, many gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic
bacteria produce efflux pumps that actively transport an antimicrobial drug out of the cell and prevent the
accumulation of drug to a level that would be antibacterial. For example, resistance to -lactams, tetracyclines, and
fluoroquinolones commonly occurs through active efflux out of the cell, and it is rather common for a single efflux
pump to have the ability to translocate multiple types of antimicrobials.
576  14 · Antimicrobial Drugs

     Target Modification
     Because antimicrobial drugs have very specific targets, structural changes to those targets can prevent drug
     binding, rendering the drug ineffective. Through spontaneous mutations in the genes encoding antibacterial drug
     targets, bacteria have an evolutionary advantage that allows them to develop resistance to drugs. This mechanism
     of resistance development is quite common. Genetic changes impacting the active site of penicillin-binding proteins
     (PBPs) can inhibit the binding of -lactam drugs and provide resistance to multiple drugs within this class. This
     mechanism is very common among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which alter their own PBPs through
     genetic mechanisms. In contrast, strains of Staphylococcus aureus develop resistance to methicillin (MRSA) through
     the acquisition of a new low-affinity PBP, rather than structurally alter their existing PBPs. Not only does this new
     low-affinity PBP provide resistance to methicillin but it provides resistance to virtually all -lactam drugs, with the
     exception of the newer fifth-generation cephalosporins designed specifically to kill MRSA. Other examples of this
     resistance strategy include alterations in

         · ribosome subunits, providing resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides;
         · lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure, providing resistance to polymyxins;
         · RNA polymerase, providing resistance to rifampin;
         · DNA gyrase, providing resistance to fluoroquinolones;
         · metabolic enzymes, providing resistance to sulfa drugs, sulfones, and trimethoprim; and
         · peptidoglycan subunit peptide chains, providing resistance to glycopeptides.

     Target Overproduction or Enzymatic Bypass
     When an antimicrobial drug functions as an antimetabolite, targeting a specific enzyme to inhibit its activity, there
     are additional ways that microbial resistance may occur. First, the microbe may overproduce the target enzyme such
     that there is a sufficient amount of antimicrobial-free enzyme to carry out the proper enzymatic reaction. Second,
     the bacterial cell may develop a bypass that circumvents the need for the functional target enzyme. Both of these
     strategies have been found as mechanisms of sulfonamide resistance. Vancomycin resistance among S. aureus has
     been shown to involve the decreased cross-linkage of peptide chains in the bacterial cell wall, which provides an
     increase in targets for vancomycin to bind to in the outer cell wall. Increased binding of vancomycin in the outer cell
     wall provides a blockage that prevents free drug molecules from penetrating to where they can block new cell wall
     synthesis.

     Target Mimicry
     A recently discovered mechanism of resistance called target mimicry involves the production of proteins that
     prevent drugs from binding to their bacterial cellular targets. For example, fluoroquinolone resistance by
     Mycobacterium tuberculosis can involve the production of a protein that resembles DNA. This protein is called MfpA
     (Mycobacterium fluoroquinolone resistance protein A). The mimicry of DNA by MfpA results in DNA gyrase binding
     to MfpA, preventing the binding of fluoroquinolones to DNA gyrase.

Multidrug-Resistant Microbes and Cross Resistance

From a clinical perspective, our greatest concerns are multidrug-resistant microbes (MDRs) and cross resistance.
MDRs are colloquially known as "superbugs" and carry one or more resistance mechanism(s), making them
resistant to multiple antimicrobials. In cross-resistance, a single resistance mechanism confers resistance to
multiple antimicrobial drugs. For example, having an efflux pump that can export multiple antimicrobial drugs is a
common way for microbes to be resistant to multiple drugs by using a single resistance mechanism. In recent years,
several clinically important superbugs have emerged, and the CDC reports that superbugs are responsible for more
than 2 million infections in the US annually, resulting in at least 23,000 fatalities.20 Several of the superbugs
discussed in the following sections have been dubbed the ESKAPE pathogens. This acronym refers to the names of
the pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) but it is also fitting in that these pathogens are able to "escape"
many conventional forms of antimicrobial therapy. As such, infections by ESKAPE pathogens can be difficult to treat
and they cause a large number of nosocomial infections.

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

Methicillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, was designed to resist inactivation by -lactamases. Unfortunately, soon after
the introduction of methicillin to clinical practice, methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus appeared and started to
spread. The mechanism of resistance, acquisition of a new low-affinity PBP, provided S. aureus with resistance to all
available -lactams. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are widespread opportunistic pathogens and
a particular concern for skin and other wound infections, but may also cause pneumonia and septicemia. Although
originally a problem in health-care settings (hospital-acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA]), MRSA infections are now also
acquired through contact with contaminated members of the general public, called community-associated MRSA
(CA-MRSA). Approximately one-third of the population carries S. aureus as a member of their normal nasal
microbiota without illness, and about 6% of these strains are methicillin resistant.21 22

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Clavulanic Acid: Penicillin's Little Helper

With the introduction of penicillin in the early 1940s, and its subsequent mass production, society began to think of
antibiotics as miracle cures for a wide range of infectious diseases. Unfortunately, as early as 1945, penicillin
resistance was first documented and started to spread. Greater than 90% of current S. aureus clinical isolates are
resistant to penicillin.23

Although developing new antimicrobial drugs is one solution to this problem, scientists have explored new
approaches, including the development of compounds that inactivate resistance mechanisms. The development of
clavulanic acid represents an early example of this strategy. Clavulanic acid is a molecule produced by the
bacterium Streptococcus clavuligerus. It contains a -lactam ring, making it structurally similar to penicillin and
other -lactams, but shows no clinical effectiveness when administered on its own. Instead, clavulanic acid binds
irreversibly within the active site of -lactamases and prevents them from inactivating a coadministered penicillin.

Clavulanic acid was first developed in the 1970s and was mass marketed in combination with amoxicillin beginning
in the 1980s under the brand name Augmentin. As is typically the case, resistance to the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
combination soon appeared. Resistance most commonly results from bacteria increasing production of their -
lactamase and overwhelming the inhibitory effects of clavulanic acid, mutating their -lactamase so it is no longer
inhibited by clavulanic acid, or from acquiring a new -lactamase that is not inhibited by clavulanic acid. Despite

     increasing resistance concerns, clavulanic acid and related -lactamase inhibitors (sulbactam and tazobactam)
     represent an important new strategy: the development of compounds that directly inhibit antimicrobial resistance-
     conferring enzymes.

     Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus

     Vancomycin is only effective against gram-positive organisms, and it is used to treat wound infections, septic
     infections, endocarditis, and meningitis that are caused by pathogens resistant to other antibiotics. It is considered
     one of the last lines of defense against such resistant infections, including MRSA. With the rise of antibiotic
     resistance in the 1970s and 1980s, vancomycin use increased, and it is not surprising that we saw the emergence
     and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and
     vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). The mechanism of vancomycin resistance among enterococci is target
     modification involving a structural change to the peptide component of the peptidoglycan subunits, preventing
     vancomycin from binding. These strains are typically spread among patients in clinical settings by contact with
     health-care workers and contaminated surfaces and medical equipment.

     VISA and VRSA strains differ from each other in the mechanism of resistance and the degree of resistance each
     mechanism confers. VISA strains exhibit intermediate resistance, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
     4-8 g/mL, and the mechanism involves an increase in vancomycin targets. VISA strains decrease the crosslinking
     of peptide chains in the cell wall, providing an increase in vancomycin targets that trap vancomycin in the outer cell
     wall. In contrast, VRSA strains acquire vancomycin resistance through horizontal transfer of resistance genes from
     VRE, an opportunity provided in individuals coinfected with both VRE and MRSA. VRSA exhibit a higher level of
     resistance, with MICs of 16 g/mL or higher.24 In the case of all three types of vancomycin-resistant bacteria, rapid
     clinical identification is necessary so proper procedures to limit spread can be implemented. The oxazolidinones like
     linezolid are useful for the treatment of these vancomycin-resistant, opportunistic pathogens, as well as MRSA.

     Extended-Spectrum -Lactamase-Producing Gram-Negative Pathogens

     Gram-negative pathogens that produce extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBLs) show resistance well beyond
     just penicillins. The spectrum of -lactams inactivated by ESBLs provides for resistance to all penicillins,
     cephalosporins, monobactams, and the -lactamase-inhibitor combinations, but not the carbapenems. An even
     greater concern is that the genes encoding for ESBLs are usually found on mobile plasmids that also contain genes
     for resistance to other drug classes (e.g., fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines), and may be readily
     spread to other bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. These multidrug-resistant bacteria are members of the
     intestinal microbiota of some individuals, but they are also important causes of opportunistic infections in
     hospitalized patients, from whom they can be spread to other people.

     Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria

     The occurrence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and carbapenem resistance among other
     gram-negative bacteria (e.g., P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophila) is a growing
     health-care concern. These pathogens develop resistance to carbapenems through a variety of mechanisms,
     including production of carbapenemases (broad-spectrum -lactamases that inactivate all -lactams, including
     carbapenems), active efflux of carbapenems out of the cell, and/or prevention of carbapenem entry through porin
     channels. Similar to concerns with ESBLs, carbapenem-resistant, gram-negative pathogens are usually resistant to
     multiple classes of antibacterials, and some have even developed pan-resistance (resistance to all available
     antibacterials). Infections with carbapenem-resistant, gram-negative pathogens commonly occur in health-care
     settings through interaction with contaminated individuals or medical devices, or as a result of surgery.

     Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis

     The emergence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant
     Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is also of significant global concern. MDR-TB strains are resistant to both
     rifampin and isoniazid, the drug combination typically prescribed for treatment of tuberculosis. XDR-TB strains are

additionally resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three other drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or
capreomycin) used as a second line of treatment, leaving these patients very few treatment options. Both types of
pathogens are particularly problematic in immunocompromised persons, including those suffering from HIV
infection. The development of resistance in these strains often results from the incorrect use of antimicrobials for
tuberculosis treatment, selecting for resistance.

Factory Farming and Drug Resistance

Although animal husbandry has long been a major part of agriculture in America, the rise of concentrated animal
feeding operations (CAFOs) since the 1950s has brought about some new environmental issues, including the
contamination of water and air with biological waste, and ethical issues regarding animal rights also are associated
with growing animals in this way. Additionally, the increase in CAFOs involves the extensive use of antimicrobial
drugs in raising livestock. Antimicrobials are used to prevent the development of infectious disease in the close
quarters of CAFOs; however, the majority of antimicrobials used in factory farming are for the promotion of
growth--in other words, to grow larger animals.

The mechanism underlying this enhanced growth remains unclear. These antibiotics may not necessarily be the
same as those used clinically for humans, but they are structurally related to drugs used for humans. As a result, use
of antimicrobial drugs in animals can select for antimicrobial resistance, with these resistant bacteria becoming
cross-resistant to drugs typically used in humans. For example, tylosin use in animals appears to select for bacteria
also cross-resistant to other macrolides, including erythromycin, commonly used in humans.

Concentrations of the drug-resistant bacterial strains generated by CAFOs become increased in water and soil
surrounding these farms. If not directly pathogenic in humans, these resistant bacteria may serve as a reservoir of
mobile genetic elements that can then pass resistance genes to human pathogens. Fortunately, the cooking process
typically inactivates any antimicrobials remaining in meat, so humans typically are not directly ingesting these
drugs. Nevertheless, many people are calling for more judicious use of these drugs, perhaps charging farmers user
fees to reduce indiscriminate use. In fact, in 2012, the FDA published guidelines for farmers who voluntarily phase
out the use of antimicrobial drugs except under veterinary supervision and when necessary to ensure animal health.
Although following the guidelines is voluntary at this time, the FDA does recommend what it calls "judicious" use of
antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals in an effort to decrease antimicrobial resistance.

  showed that her infection was caused by a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae with significant antimicrobial
  resistance. The resistance profile of this K. pneumoniae included resistance to the carbapenem class of
  antibacterials, a group of -lactams that is typically reserved for the treatment of highly resistant bacteria. K.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe how the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test determines the susceptibility of a microbe to an
             antibacterial drug.

         · Explain the significance of the minimal inhibitory concentration and the minimal bactericidal
             concentration relative to the effectiveness of an antimicrobial drug.

     Testing the effectiveness of antimicrobial drugs against specific organisms is important in identifying their spectrum
     of activity and the therapeutic dosage. This type of test, generally described as antimicrobial susceptibility testing
     (AST), is commonly performed in a clinical laboratory. In this section, we will discuss common methods of testing
     the effectiveness of antimicrobials.

     The Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion Test

     The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test has long been used as a starting point for determining the susceptibility of
     specific microbes to various antimicrobial drugs. The Kirby-Bauer assay starts with a Mueller-Hinton agar plate on
     which a confluent lawn is inoculated with a patient's isolated bacterial pathogen. Filter paper disks impregnated
     with known amounts of antibacterial drugs to be tested are then placed on the agar plate. As the bacterial inoculum
     grows, antibiotic diffuses from the circular disk into the agar and interacts with the growing bacteria. Antibacterial
     activity is observed as a clear circular zone of inhibition around the drug-impregnated disk, similar to the disk-
     diffusion assay depicted in Figure 13.31. The diameter of the zone of inhibition, measured in millimeters and
     compared to a standardized chart, determines the susceptibility or resistance of the bacterial pathogen to the drug.

     There are multiple factors that determine the size of a zone of inhibition in this assay, including drug solubility, rate
     of drug diffusion through agar, the thickness of the agar medium, and the drug concentration impregnated into the
     disk. Due to a lack of standardization of these factors, interpretation of the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay provides
     only limited information on susceptibility and resistance to the drugs tested. The assay cannot distinguish between
     bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities, and differences in zone sizes cannot be used to compare drug potencies or
     efficacies. Comparison of zone sizes to a standardized chart will only provide information on the antibacterials to
     which a bacterial pathogen is susceptible or resistant.

to the diagnosis, causative agent(s), and drug most likely to be effective. This approach allows treatment to begin
sooner so the patient does not have to wait for lab test results. In many cases, the prescription is effective; however,
in an age of increased antimicrobial resistance, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to select the most
appropriate empiric therapy. Selecting an inappropriate empiric therapy not only puts the patient at risk but may
promote greater resistance to the drug prescribed.

Recently, studies have shown that antibiograms are useful tools in the decision-making process of selecting
appropriate empiric therapy. An antibiogram is a compilation of local antibiotic susceptibility data broken down by
bacterial pathogen. In a November 2014 study published in the journal Infection Control and Hospital
Epidemiology, researchers determined that 85% of the prescriptions ordered in skilled nursing facilities were
decided upon empirically, but only 35% of those prescriptions were deemed appropriate when compared with the
eventual pathogen identification and susceptibility profile obtained from the clinical laboratory. However, in one
nursing facility where use of antibiograms was implemented to direct selection of empiric therapy, appropriateness
of empiric therapy increased from 32% before antibiogram implementation to 45% after implementation of
antibiograms.25 Although these data are preliminary, they do suggest that health-care facilities can reduce the
number of inappropriate prescriptions by using antibiograms to select empiric therapy, thus benefiting patients and
minimizing opportunities for antimicrobial resistance to develop.

Dilution Tests

As discussed, the limitations of the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test do not allow for a direct comparison of
antibacterial potencies to guide selection of the best therapeutic choice. However, antibacterial dilution tests can be
used to determine a particular drug's minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the lowest concentration of drug
that inhibits visible bacterial growth, and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the lowest drug concentration
that kills 99.9% of the starting inoculum. Determining these concentrations helps identify the correct drug for a
particular pathogen. For the macrobroth dilution assay, a dilution series of the drug in broth is made in test tubes
and the same number of cells of a test bacterial strain is added to each tube (Figure 14.19). The MIC is determined
by examining the tubes to find the lowest drug concentration that inhibits visible growth; this is observed as
turbidity (cloudiness) in the broth. Tubes with no visible growth are then inoculated onto agar media without
antibiotic to determine the MBC. Generally, serum levels of an antibacterial should be at least three to five times
above the MIC for treatment of an infection.

The MIC assay can also be performed using 96-well microdilution trays, which allow for the use of small volumes
and automated dispensing devices, as well as the testing of multiple antimicrobials and/or microorganisms in one

macrobroth dilution in test tubes. Growth may also be interpreted visually or by using a spectrophotometer or
similar device to detect turbidity or a color change if an appropriate biochemical substrate that changes color in the
presence of bacterial growth is also included in each well.

The Etest is an alternative method used to determine MIC, and is a combination of the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion
test and dilution methods. Similar to the Kirby-Bauer assay, a confluent lawn of a bacterial isolate is inoculated onto
the surface of an agar plate. Rather than using circular disks impregnated with one concentration of drug, however,
commercially available plastic strips that contain a gradient of an antibacterial are placed on the surface of the
inoculated agar plate (Figure 14.21). As the bacterial inoculum grows, antibiotic diffuses from the plastic strips into
the agar and interacts with the bacterial cells. Because the rate of drug diffusion is directly related to concentration,
an elliptical zone of inhibition is observed with the Etest drug gradient, rather than a circular zone of inhibition
observed with the Kirby-Bauer assay. To interpret the results, the intersection of the elliptical zone with the gradient

     placed on the same plate, the MIC of multiple antimicrobials can be determined concurrently and directly
     compared. However, unlike the macrobroth and microbroth dilution methods, the MBC cannot be determined with
     the Etest.

  Marisa's UTI was likely caused by the catheterizations she had in Vietnam. Most bacteria that cause UTIs are
  members of the normal gut microbiota, but they can cause infections when introduced to the urinary tract, as
  might have occurred when the catheter was inserted. Alternatively, if the catheter itself was not sterile, bacteria
  on its surface could have been introduced into Marisa's body. The antimicrobial therapy Marisa received in
  Cambodia may also have been a complicating factor because it may have selected for antimicrobial-resistant
  strains already present in her body. These bacteria would have already contained genes for antimicrobial
  resistance, either acquired by spontaneous mutation or through horizontal gene transfer, and, therefore, had the
  best evolutionary advantage for adaptation and growth in the presence of the antimicrobial therapy. As a result,
  one of these resistant strains may have been subsequently introduced into her urinary tract.

  Laboratory testing at the CDC confirmed that the strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae from Marisa's urine sample
  was positive for the presence of NDM, a very active carbapenemase that is beginning to emerge as a new
  problem in antimicrobial resistance. While NDM-positive strains are resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials,
  they have shown susceptibility to tigecycline (structurally related to tetracycline) and the polymyxins B and E
  (colistin).

  To prevent her infection from spreading, Marisa was isolated from the other patients in a separate room. All
  hospital staff interacting with her were advised to follow strict protocols to prevent surface and equipment
  contamination. This would include especially stringent hand hygiene practices and careful disinfection of all
  items coming into contact with her.

  Marisa's infection finally responded to tigecycline and eventually cleared. She was discharged a few weeks after
  admission, and a follow-up stool sample showed her stool to be free of NDM-containing K. pneumoniae,
  meaning that she was no longer harboring the highly resistant bacterium.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    · Describe the methods and strategies used for discovery of new antimicrobial agents.
584  14 · Antimicrobial Drugs

     With the continued evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and now the identification of pan-resistant
     bacterial pathogens, the search for new antimicrobials is essential for preventing the postantibiotic era. Although
     development of more effective semisynthetic derivatives is one strategy, resistance to them develops rapidly
     because bacterial pathogens are already resistant to earlier-generation drugs in the family and can easily mutate
     and develop resistance to the new semisynthetic drugs. Today, scientists continue to hunt for new antimicrobial
     compounds and explore new avenues of antimicrobial discovery and synthesis. They check large numbers of soils
     and microbial products for antimicrobial activity by using high-throughput screening methods, which use
     automation to test large numbers of samples simultaneously. The recent development of the iChip26 allows
     researchers to investigate the antimicrobial-producing capabilities of soil microbes that are difficult to grow by
     standard cultivation techniques in the laboratory. Rather than grow the microbes in the laboratory, they are grown in
     situ--right in the soil. Use of the iChip has resulted in the discovery of teixobactin, a novel antimicrobial from Mount
     Ararat, Turkey. Teixobactin targets two distinct steps in gram-positive cell wall synthesis and for which antimicrobial
     resistance appears not yet to have evolved.

     Although soils have been widely examined, other environmental niches have not been tested as fully. Since 70% of
     the earth is covered with water, marine environments could be mined more fully for the presence of antimicrobial-
     producing microbes. In addition, researchers are using combinatorial chemistry, a method for making a very large
     number of related compounds from simple precursors, and testing them for antimicrobial activity. An additional
     strategy that needs to be explored further is the development of compounds that inhibit resistance mechanisms and
     restore the activity of older drugs, such as the strategy described earlier for -lactamase inhibitors like clavulanic
     acid. Finally, developing inhibitors of virulence factor production and function could be a very important avenue.
     Although this strategy would not be directly antibacterial, drugs that slow the progression of an infection could
     provide an advantage for the immune system and could be used successfully in combination with antimicrobial
     drugs.

         · What are new sources and strategies for developing drugs to fight infectious diseases?

     EYE ON ETHICS

     The (Free?) Market for New Antimicrobials

     There used to be plenty of antimicrobial drugs on the market to treat infectious diseases. However, the spread of
     antimicrobial resistance has created a need for new antibiotics to replace those that are no longer as effective as
     they once were. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical companies are not particularly motivated to fill this need. As of
     2009, all but five pharmaceutical companies had moved away from antimicrobial drug development.27 As a
     result, the number of FDA approvals of new antimicrobials has fallen drastically in recent decades (Figure
     14.22).

     Given that demand usually encourages supply, one might expect pharmaceutical companies to be rushing to get
     back in the business of developing new antibiotics. But developing new drugs is a lengthy process and requires
     large investments in research and development. Pharmaceutical companies can typically get a higher return on
     their investment by developing products for chronic, nonmicrobial diseases like diabetes; such drugs must be
     taken for life, and therefore generate more long-term revenue than an antibiotic that does its job in a week or
     two. But what will happen when drugs like vancomycin, a superantimicrobial reserved for use as a last resort,
     begin to lose their effectiveness against ever more drug-resistant superbugs? Will drug companies wait until all
     antibiotics have become useless before beginning to look for new ones?

Recently, it has been suggested that large pharmaceutical companies should be given financial incentives to
pursue such research. In September 2014, the White House released an executive order entitled "Combating
Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria," calling upon various government agencies and the private sector to work together
to "accelerate basic and applied research and development for new antimicrobials, other therapeutics, and
vaccines."28 As a result, as of March 2015, President Obama's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget doubled the
amount of federal funding to $1.2 billion for "combating and preventing antibiotic resistance," which includes
money for antimicrobial research and development.29 Similar suggestions have also been made on a global
scale. In December 2014, a report chaired by former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill was published in
The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance.30

These developments reflect the growing belief that for-profit pharmaceutical companies must be subsidized to
encourage development of new antimicrobials. But some ask whether pharmaceutical development should be
motivated by profit at all. Given that millions of lives may hang in the balance, some might argue that drug
companies have an ethical obligation to devote their research and development efforts to high-utility drugs, as
opposed to highly profitable ones. Yet this obligation conflicts with the fundamental goals of a for-profit
company. Are government subsidies enough to ensure that drug companies make the public interest a priority,
or should government agencies assume responsibility for developing critical drugs that may have little or no
return on investment?

   FIGURE 14.22 In recent decades, approvals of new antimicrobials by the FDA have steadily fallen. In the five-year period from
   1983-1987, 16 new antimicrobial drugs were approved, compared to just two from 2008-2012.

INTRODUCTION Jane woke up one spring morning feeling not quite herself. Her throat felt a bit dry and she was
sniffling. She wondered why she felt so lousy. Was it because of a change in the weather? The pollen count? Was she
coming down with something? Did she catch a bug from her coworker who sneezed on her in the elevator yesterday?
The signs and symptoms we associate with illness can have many different causes. Sometimes they are the direct
result of a pathogenic infection, but in other cases they result from a response by our immune system to a pathogen
or another perceived threat. For example, in response to certain pathogens, the immune system may release
pyrogens, chemicals that cause the body temperature to rise, resulting in a fever. This response creates a less-than-
favorable environment for the pathogen, but it also makes us feel sick.
Medical professionals rely heavily on analysis of signs and symptoms to determine the cause of an ailment and
prescribe treatment. In some cases, signs and symptoms alone are enough to correctly identify the causative agent
of a disease, but since few diseases produce truly unique symptoms, it is often necessary to confirm the identity of
the infectious agent by other direct and indirect diagnostic methods.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Michael, a 10-year-old boy in generally good health, went to a birthday party on Sunday with his family. He ate
       many different foods but was the only one in the family to eat the undercooked hot dogs served by the hosts.
       Monday morning, he woke up feeling achy and nauseous, and he was running a fever of 38 °C (100.4 °F). His
       parents, assuming Michael had caught the flu, made him stay home from school and limited his activities. But
       after 4 days, Michael began to experience severe headaches, and his fever spiked to 40 °C (104 °F). Growing
       worried, his parents finally decide to take Michael to a nearby clinic.

     A disease is any condition in which the normal structure or functions of the body are damaged or impaired. Physical
     injuries or disabilities are not classified as disease, but there can be several causes for disease, including infection
     by a pathogen, genetics (as in many cancers or deficiencies), noninfectious environmental causes, or inappropriate
     immune responses. Our focus in this chapter will be on infectious diseases, although when diagnosing infectious
     diseases, it is always important to consider possible noninfectious causes.

     Signs and Symptoms of Disease

     An infection is the successful colonization of a host by a microorganism. Infections can lead to disease, which
     causes signs and symptoms resulting in a deviation from the normal structure or functioning of the host.
     Microorganisms that can cause disease are known as pathogens.

     The signs of disease are objective and measurable, and can be directly observed by a clinician. Vital signs, which are
     used to measure the body's basic functions, include body temperature (normally 37 °C [98.6 °F]), heart rate
     (normally 60-100 beats per minute), breathing rate (normally 12-18 breaths per minute), and blood pressure
     (normally between 90/60 and 120/80 mm Hg). Changes in any of the body's vital signs may be indicative of disease.
     For example, having a fever (a body temperature significantly higher than 37 °C or 98.6 °F) is a sign of disease
     because it can be measured.

     In addition to changes in vital signs, other observable conditions may be considered signs of disease. For example,
     the presence of antibodies in a patient's serum (the liquid portion of blood that lacks clotting factors) can be
     observed and measured through blood tests and, therefore, can be considered a sign. However, it is important to
     note that the presence of antibodies is not always a sign of an active disease. Antibodies can remain in the body long
     after an infection has resolved; also, they may develop in response to a pathogen that is in the body but not
     currently causing disease.

     Unlike signs, symptoms of disease are subjective. Symptoms are felt or experienced by the patient, but they cannot
     be clinically confirmed or objectively measured. Examples of symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, and pain.
     Such symptoms are important to consider when diagnosing disease, but they are subject to memory bias and are
     difficult to measure precisely. Some clinicians attempt to quantify symptoms by asking patients to assign a
     numerical value to their symptoms. For example, the Wong-Baker Faces pain-rating scale asks patients to rate their
     pain on a scale of 0-10. An alternative method of quantifying pain is measuring skin conductance fluctuations.
     These fluctuations reflect sweating due to skin sympathetic nerve activity resulting from the stressor of pain.1

     A specific group of signs and symptoms characteristic of a particular disease is called a syndrome. Many syndromes
     are named using a nomenclature based on signs and symptoms or the location of the disease. Table 15.1 lists some
     of the prefixes and suffixes commonly used in naming syndromes.

TABLE 15.1

Clinicians must rely on signs and on asking questions about symptoms, medical history, and the patient's recent
activities to identify a particular disease and the potential causative agent. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that
different microorganisms can cause similar signs and symptoms in a patient. For example, an individual presenting
with symptoms of diarrhea may have been infected by one of a wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms. Bacterial
pathogens associated with diarrheal disease include Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni,
and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Viral pathogens associated with diarrheal disease include norovirus
and rotavirus. Parasitic pathogens associated with diarrhea include Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum.
Likewise, fever is indicative of many types of infection, from the common cold to the deadly Ebola hemorrhagic
fever.

Finally, some diseases may be asymptomatic or subclinical, meaning they do not present any noticeable signs or
symptoms. For example, most individual infected with herpes simplex virus remain asymptomatic and are unaware
that they have been infected.

Classifications of Disease

The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is used in clinical fields to
classify diseases and monitor morbidity (the number of cases of a disease) and mortality (the number of deaths due
to a disease). In this section, we will introduce terminology used by the ICD (and in health-care professions in
general) to describe and categorize various types of disease.

An infectious disease is any disease caused by the direct effect of a pathogen. A pathogen may be cellular
(bacteria, parasites, and fungi) or acellular (viruses, viroids, and prions). Some infectious diseases are also
communicable, meaning they are capable of being spread from person to person through either direct or indirect
mechanisms. Some infectious communicable diseases are also considered contagious diseases, meaning they are
easily spread from person to person. Not all contagious diseases are equally so; the degree to which a disease is
contagious usually depends on how the pathogen is transmitted. For example, measles is a highly contagious viral
594  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     disease that can be transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes and an uninfected person breathes in
     droplets containing the virus. Gonorrhea is not as contagious as measles because transmission of the pathogen
     (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) requires close intimate contact (usually sexual) between an infected person and an
     uninfected person.

     Diseases that are contracted as the result of a medical procedure are known as iatrogenic diseases. Iatrogenic
     diseases can occur after procedures involving wound treatments, catheterization, or surgery if the wound or surgical
     site becomes contaminated. For example, an individual treated for a skin wound might acquire necrotizing fasciitis
     (an aggressive, "flesh-eating" disease) if bandages or other dressings became contaminated by Clostridium
     perfringens or one of several other bacteria that can cause this condition.

     Diseases acquired in hospital settings are known as nosocomial diseases. Several factors contribute to the
     prevalence and severity of nosocomial diseases. First, sick patients bring numerous pathogens into hospitals, and
     some of these pathogens can be transmitted easily via improperly sterilized medical equipment, bed sheets, call
     buttons, door handles, or by clinicians, nurses, or therapists who do not wash their hands before touching a patient.
     Second, many hospital patients have weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections.
     Compounding this, the prevalence of antibiotics in hospital settings can select for drug-resistant bacteria that can
     cause very serious infections that are difficult to treat.

     Certain infectious diseases are not transmitted between humans directly but can be transmitted from animals to
     humans. Such a disease is called zoonotic disease (or zoonosis). According to WHO, a zoonosis is a disease that
     occurs when a pathogen is transferred from a vertebrate animal to a human; however, sometimes the term is
     defined more broadly to include diseases transmitted by all animals (including invertebrates). For example, rabies is
     a viral zoonotic disease spread from animals to humans through bites and contact with infected saliva. Many other
     zoonotic diseases rely on insects or other arthropods for transmission. Examples include yellow fever (transmitted
     through the bite of mosquitoes infected with yellow fever virus) and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (transmitted
     through the bite of ticks infected with Rickettsia rickettsii).

     In contrast to communicable infectious diseases, a noncommunicable infectious disease is not spread from one
     person to another. One example is tetanus, caused by Clostridium tetani, a bacterium that produces endospores
     that can survive in the soil for many years. This disease is typically only transmitted through contact with a skin
     wound; it cannot be passed from an infected person to another person. Similarly, Legionnaires disease is caused by
     Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium that lives within amoebae in moist locations like water-cooling towers. An
     individual may contract Legionnaires disease via contact with the contaminated water, but once infected, the
     individual cannot pass the pathogen to other individuals.

     In addition to the wide variety of noncommunicable infectious diseases, noninfectious diseases (those not caused
     by pathogens) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Noninfectious diseases can be caused
     by a wide variety factors, including genetics, the environment, or immune system dysfunction, to name a few. For
     example, sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease caused by a genetic mutation that can be passed from parent to
     offspring (Figure 15.2). Other types of noninfectious diseases are listed in Table 15.2.

Periods of Disease

The five periods of disease (sometimes referred to as stages or phases) include the incubation, prodromal, illness,
decline, and convalescence periods (Figure 15.3). The incubation period occurs in an acute disease after the initial
596  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     entry of the pathogen into the host (patient). It is during this time the pathogen begins multiplying in the host.
     However, there are insufficient numbers of pathogen particles (cells or viruses) present to cause signs and
     symptoms of disease. Incubation periods can vary from a day or two in acute disease to months or years in chronic
     disease, depending upon the pathogen. Factors involved in determining the length of the incubation period are
     diverse, and can include strength of the pathogen, strength of the host immune defenses, site of infection, type of
     infection, and the size infectious dose received. During this incubation period, the patient is unaware that a disease
     is beginning to develop.

     FIGURE 15.3 The progression of an infectious disease can be divided into five periods, which are related to the number of pathogen
     particles (red) and the severity of signs and symptoms (blue).

     The prodromal period occurs after the incubation period. During this phase, the pathogen continues to multiply and
     the host begins to experience general signs and symptoms of illness, which typically result from activation of the
     immune system, such as fever, pain, soreness, swelling, or inflammation. Usually, such signs and symptoms are too
     general to indicate a particular disease. Following the prodromal period is the period of illness, during which the
     signs and symptoms of disease are most obvious and severe.

     The period of illness is followed by the period of decline, during which the number of pathogen particles begins to
     decrease, and the signs and symptoms of illness begin to decline. However, during the decline period, patients may
     become susceptible to developing secondary infections because their immune systems have been weakened by the
     primary infection. The final period is known as the period of convalescence. During this stage, the patient generally
     returns to normal functions, although some diseases may inflict permanent damage that the body cannot fully
     repair.

     Infectious diseases can be contagious during all five of the periods of disease. Which periods of disease are more
     likely to associated with transmissibility of an infection depends upon the disease, the pathogen, and the
     mechanisms by which the disease develops and progresses. For example, with meningitis (infection of the lining of
     brain), the periods of infectivity depend on the type of pathogen causing the infection. Patients with bacterial
     meningitis are contagious during the incubation period for up to a week before the onset of the prodromal period,
     whereas patients with viral meningitis become contagious when the first signs and symptoms of the prodromal
     period appear. With many viral diseases associated with rashes (e.g., chickenpox, measles, rubella, roseola),
     patients are contagious during the incubation period up to a week before the rash develops. In contrast, with many
     respiratory infections (e.g., colds, influenza, diphtheria, strep throat, and pertussis) the patient becomes contagious
     with the onset of the prodromal period. Depending upon the pathogen, the disease, and the individual infected,

transmission can still occur during the periods of decline, convalescence, and even long after signs and symptoms of
the disease disappear. For example, an individual recovering from a diarrheal disease may continue to carry and
shed the pathogen in feces for some time, posing a risk of transmission to others through direct contact or indirect
contact (e.g., through contaminated objects or food).

    · Name some of the factors that can affect the length of the incubation period of a particular disease.

Acute and Chronic Diseases

The duration of the period of illness can vary greatly, depending on the pathogen, effectiveness of the immune
response in the host, and any medical treatment received. For an acute disease, pathologic changes occur over a
relatively short time (e.g., hours, days, or a few weeks) and involve a rapid onset of disease conditions. For example,
influenza (caused by Influenzavirus) is considered an acute disease because the incubation period is approximately
1-2 days. Infected individuals can spread influenza to others for approximately 5 days after becoming ill. After
approximately 1 week, individuals enter the period of decline.

For a chronic disease, pathologic changes can occur over longer time spans (e.g., months, years, or a lifetime). For
example, chronic gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach) is caused by the gram-negative bacterium
Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori is able to colonize the stomach and persist in its highly acidic environment by
producing the enzyme urease, which modifies the local acidity, allowing the bacteria to survive indefinitely.2
Consequently, H. pylori infections can recur indefinitely unless the infection is cleared using antibiotics.3 Hepatitis B
virus can cause a chronic infection in some patients who do not eliminate the virus after the acute illness. A chronic
infection with hepatitis B virus is characterized by the continued production of infectious virus for 6 months or
longer after the acute infection, as measured by the presence of viral antigen in blood samples.

In latent diseases, as opposed to chronic infections, the causal pathogen goes dormant for extended periods of
time with no active replication. Examples of diseases that go into a latent state after the acute infection include
herpes (herpes simplex viruses [HSV-1 and HSV-2]), chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus [VZV]), and mononucleosis
(Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]). HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV evade the host immune system by residing in a latent form within
cells of the nervous system for long periods of time, but they can reactivate to become active infections during times
of stress and immunosuppression. For example, an initial infection by VZV may result in a case of childhood
chickenpox, followed by a long period of latency. The virus may reactivate decades later, causing episodes of
shingles in adulthood. EBV goes into latency in B cells of the immune system and possibly epithelial cells; it can
reactivate years later to produce B-cell lymphoma.

     For most infectious diseases, the ability to accurately identify the causative pathogen is a critical step in finding or
     prescribing effective treatments. Today's physicians, patients, and researchers owe a sizable debt to the physician
     Robert Koch (1843-1910), who devised a systematic approach for confirming causative relationships between
     diseases and specific pathogens.

     Koch's Postulates

     In 1884, Koch published four postulates (Table 15.3) that summarized his method for determining whether a
     particular microorganism was the cause of a particular disease. Each of Koch's postulates represents a criterion that
     must be met before a disease can be positively linked with a pathogen. In order to determine whether the criteria
     are met, tests are performed on laboratory animals and cultures from healthy and diseased animals are compared
     (Figure 15.4).

                                                                       Koch's Postulates

       (1) The suspected pathogen must be found in every case of disease and not be found in healthy individuals.

       (2) The suspected pathogen can be isolated and grown in pure culture.

       (3) A healthy test subject infected with the suspected pathogen must develop the same signs and symptoms of
       disease as seen in postulate 1.

       (4) The pathogen must be re-isolated from the new host and must be identical to the pathogen from postulate 2.

     TABLE 15.3

                      FIGURE 15.4 The steps for confirming that a pathogen is the cause of a particular disease using Koch's postulates.

     In many ways, Koch's postulates are still central to our current understanding of the causes of disease. However,

15.2 · How Pathogens Cause Disease                                                                                        599

advances in microbiology have revealed some important limitations in Koch's criteria. Koch made several
assumptions that we now know are untrue in many cases. The first relates to postulate 1, which assumes that
pathogens are only found in diseased, not healthy, individuals. This is not true for many pathogens. For example, H.
pylori, described earlier in this chapter as a pathogen causing chronic gastritis, is also part of the normal microbiota
of the stomach in many healthy humans who never develop gastritis. It is estimated that upwards of 50% of the
human population acquires H. pylori early in life, with most maintaining it as part of the normal microbiota for the
rest of their life without ever developing disease. Similarly, when Alice Katherine Evans discovered that Brucellis
bacteria found in cows was responsible for a common human disease, she noted that the infected cattle could pass
on the infection whether or not they displayed symptoms. This is an important distinction: Even without knowledge
of microbiology, many people would not consume milk from a visibly sick cow, but the concept of a healthy cow
being infectious is critical to understanding the risks posed by pathogens.

Koch's second faulty assumption was that all healthy test subjects are equally susceptible to disease. We now know
that individuals are not equally susceptible to disease. Individuals are unique in terms of their microbiota and the
state of their immune system at any given time. The makeup of the resident microbiota can influence an individual's
susceptibility to an infection. Members of the normal microbiota play an important role in immunity by inhibiting the
growth of transient pathogens. In some cases, the microbiota may prevent a pathogen from establishing an
infection; in others, it may not prevent an infection altogether but may influence the severity or type of signs and
symptoms. As a result, two individuals with the same disease may not always present with the same signs and
symptoms. In addition, some individuals have stronger immune systems than others. Individuals with immune
systems weakened by age or an unrelated illness are much more susceptible to certain infections than individuals
with strong immune systems.

Koch also assumed that all pathogens are microorganisms that can be grown in pure culture (postulate 2) and that
animals could serve as reliable models for human disease. However, we now know that not all pathogens can be
grown in pure culture, and many human diseases cannot be reliably replicated in animal hosts. Viruses and certain
bacteria, including Rickettsia and Chlamydia, are obligate intracellular pathogens that can grow only when inside a
host cell. If a microbe cannot be cultured, a researcher cannot move past postulate 2. Likewise, without a suitable
nonhuman host, a researcher cannot evaluate postulate 3 without deliberately infecting humans, which presents
obvious ethical concerns. AIDS is an example of such a disease because the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
only causes disease in humans.

    · Briefly summarize the limitations of Koch's postulates.

Molecular Koch's Postulates

In 1988, Stanley Falkow (1934-) proposed a revised form of Koch's postulates known as molecular Koch's
postulates. These are listed in the left column of Table 15.4. The premise for molecular Koch's postulates is not in
the ability to isolate a particular pathogen but rather to identify a gene that may cause the organism to be
pathogenic.

Falkow's modifications to Koch's original postulates explain not only infections caused by intracellular pathogens
but also the existence of pathogenic strains of organisms that are usually nonpathogenic. For example, the
predominant form of the bacterium Escherichia coli is a member of the normal microbiota of the human intestine
and is generally considered harmless. However, there are pathogenic strains of E. coli such as enterotoxigenic E. coli
(ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (O157:H7) (EHEC). We now know ETEC and EHEC exist because of the
acquisition of new genes by the once-harmless E. coli, which, in the form of these pathogenic strains, is now capable
of producing toxins and causing illness. The pathogenic forms resulted from minor genetic changes. The right-side
column of Table 15.4 illustrates how molecular Koch's postulates can be applied to identify EHEC as a pathogenic
bacterium.

                                                  restored.

     TABLE 15.4

     As with Koch's original postulates, the molecular Koch's postulates have limitations. For example, genetic
     manipulation of some pathogens is not possible using current methods of molecular genetics. In a similar vein,
     some diseases do not have suitable animal models, which limits the utility of both the original and molecular
     postulates.

     · Explain the differences between Koch's original postulates and the molecular Koch's postulates.

     Pathogenicity and Virulence

     The ability of a microbial agent to cause disease is called pathogenicity, and the degree to which an organism is
     pathogenic is called virulence. Virulence is a continuum. On one end of the spectrum are organisms that are
     avirulent (not harmful) and on the other are organisms that are highly virulent. Highly virulent pathogens will almost
     always lead to a disease state when introduced to the body, and some may even cause multi-organ and body system
     failure in healthy individuals. Less virulent pathogens may cause an initial infection, but may not always cause
     severe illness. Pathogens with low virulence would more likely result in mild signs and symptoms of disease, such as
     low-grade fever, headache, or muscle aches. Some individuals might even be asymptomatic.

     An example of a highly virulent microorganism is Bacillus anthracis, the pathogen responsible for anthrax. B.
     anthracis can produce different forms of disease, depending on the route of transmission (e.g., cutaneous injection,
     inhalation, ingestion). The most serious form of anthrax is inhalation anthrax. After B. anthracis spores are inhaled,
     they germinate. An active infection develops and the bacteria release potent toxins that cause edema (fluid buildup
     in tissues), hypoxia (a condition preventing oxygen from reaching tissues), and necrosis (cell death and
     inflammation). Signs and symptoms of inhalation anthrax include high fever, difficulty breathing, vomiting and
     coughing up blood, and severe chest pains suggestive of a heart attack. With inhalation anthrax, the toxins and
     bacteria enter the bloodstream, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death of the patient. If a gene (or genes)
     involved in pathogenesis is inactivated, the bacteria become less virulent or nonpathogenic.

     Virulence of a pathogen can be quantified using controlled experiments with laboratory animals. Two important
     indicators of virulence are the median infectious dose (ID50) and the median lethal dose (LD50), both of which are
     typically determined experimentally using animal models. The ID50 is the number of pathogen cells or virions
     required to cause active infection in 50% of inoculated animals. The LD50 is the number of pathogenic cells, virions,
     or amount of toxin required to kill 50% of infected animals. To calculate these values, each group of animals is

measuring the LD50 of a pathogen. Interpretation of the data from this graph indicates that the LD50 of the pathogen
for the test animals is 104 pathogen cells or virions (depending upon the pathogen studied).

FIGURE 15.5 A graph like this is used to determine LD50 by plotting pathogen concentration against the percent of infected test animals
that have died. In this example, the LD50 = 104 pathogenic particles.

Table 15.5 lists selected foodborne pathogens and their ID50 values in humans (as determined from epidemiologic
data and studies on human volunteers). Keep in mind that these are median values. The actual infective dose for an
individual can vary widely, depending on factors such as route of entry; the age, health, and immune status of the
host; and environmental and pathogen-specific factors such as susceptibility to the acidic pH of the stomach. It is
also important to note that a pathogen's infective dose does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. For
example, just a single cell of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium can result in an active infection. The
resultant disease, Salmonella gastroenteritis or salmonellosis, can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but has a
mortality rate of less than 1% in healthy adults. In contrast, S. enterica serotype Typhi has a much higher ID50,
typically requiring as many as 1,000 cells to produce infection. However, this serotype causes typhoid fever, a much
more systemic and severe disease that has a mortality rate as high as 10% in untreated individuals.

     Primary Pathogens versus Opportunistic Pathogens

     Pathogens can be classified as either primary pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. A primary pathogen can cause
     disease in a host regardless of the host's resident microbiota or immune system. An opportunistic pathogen, by
     contrast, can only cause disease in situations that compromise the host's defenses, such as the body's protective
     barriers, immune system, or normal microbiota. Individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections include the very
     young, the elderly, people who are pregnant, patients undergoing chemotherapy, people with immunodeficiencies
     (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), patients who are recovering from surgery, and those who
     have had a breach of protective barriers (such as a severe wound or burn).

     An example of a primary pathogen is enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which produces a virulence factor known as
     Shiga toxin. This toxin inhibits protein synthesis, leading to severe and bloody diarrhea, inflammation, and renal
     failure, even in patients with healthy immune systems. Staphylococcus epidermidis, on the other hand, is an
     opportunistic pathogen that is among the most frequent causes of nosocomial disease.5 S. epidermidis is a member
     of the normal microbiota of the skin, where it is generally avirulent. However, in hospitals, it can also grow in biofilms
     that form on catheters, implants, or other devices that are inserted into the body during surgical procedures. Once
     inside the body, S. epidermidis can cause serious infections such as endocarditis, and it produces virulence factors
     that promote the persistence of such infections.

     Other members of the normal microbiota can also cause opportunistic infections under certain conditions. This
     often occurs when microbes that reside harmlessly in one body location end up in a different body system, where

they cause disease. For example, E. coli normally found in the large intestine can cause a urinary tract infection if it
enters the bladder. This is the leading cause of urinary tract infections among females.

Members of the normal microbiota may also cause disease when a shift in the environment of the body leads to
overgrowth of a particular microorganism. For example, the yeast Candida is part of the normal microbiota of the
skin, mouth, intestine, and vagina, but its population is kept in check by other organisms of the microbiota. If an
individual is taking antibacterial medications, however, bacteria that would normally inhibit the growth of Candida
can be killed off, leading to a sudden growth in the population of Candida, which is not affected by antibacterial
medications because it is a fungus. An overgrowth of Candida can manifest as oral thrush (growth on mouth, throat,
and tongue), a vaginal yeast infection, or cutaneous candidiasis. Other scenarios can also provide opportunities for
Candida infections. Untreated diabetes can result in a high concentration of glucose in the saliva, which provides an
optimal environment for the growth of Candida, resulting in thrush. Immunodeficiencies such as those seen in
patients with HIV, AIDS, and cancer also lead to higher incidence of thrush. Vaginal yeast infections can result from
decreases in estrogen levels during the menstruation or menopause. The amount of glycogen available to
lactobacilli in the vagina is controlled by levels of estrogen; when estrogen levels are low, lactobacilli produce less
lactic acid. The resultant increase in vaginal pH allows overgrowth of Candida in the vagina.

Stages of Pathogenesis

To cause disease, a pathogen must successfully achieve four steps or stages of pathogenesis: exposure (contact),
adhesion (colonization), invasion, and infection. The pathogen must be able to gain entry to the host, travel to the
location where it can establish an infection, evade or overcome the host's immune response, and cause damage
(i.e., disease) to the host. In many cases, the cycle is completed when the pathogen exits the host and is transmitted
to a new host.

Exposure
An encounter with a potential pathogen is known as exposure or contact. The food we eat and the objects we
handle are all ways that we can come into contact with potential pathogens. Yet, not all contacts result in infection
and disease. For a pathogen to cause disease, it needs to be able to gain access into host tissue. An anatomic site
through which pathogens can pass into host tissue is called a portal of entry. These are locations where the host
cells are in direct contact with the external environment. Major portals of entry are identified in Figure 15.6 and
include the skin, mucous membranes, and parenteral routes.
604  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     FIGURE 15.6 Shown are different portals of entry where pathogens can gain access into the body. With the exception of the placenta, which
     is only present during pregnancy, many of these locations are directly exposed to external environments.

     Mucosal surfaces are the most important portals of entry for microbes; these include the mucous membranes of the
     respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the genitourinary tract. Although most mucosal surfaces are in the
     interior of the body, some are contiguous with the external skin at various body openings, including the eyes, nose,
     mouth, urethra, and anus.

     Most pathogens are suited to a particular portal of entry. A pathogen's portal specificity is determined by the
     organism's environmental adaptions and by the enzymes and toxins they secrete. The respiratory and
     gastrointestinal tracts are particularly vulnerable portals of entry because particles that include microorganisms are
     constantly inhaled or ingested, respectively.

     Pathogens can also enter through a breach in the protective barriers of the skin and mucous membranes. Pathogens
     that enter the body in this way are said to enter by the parenteral route. For example, the skin is a good natural
     barrier to pathogens, but breaks in the skin (e.g., wounds, insect bites, animal bites, needle pricks) can provide a
     parenteral portal of entry for microorganisms.

     In pregnant people, the placenta normally prevents microorganisms from passing from the pregnant person to the
     fetus. However, a few pathogens are capable of crossing the blood-placental barrier. The gram-positive bacterium
     Listeria monocytogenes, which causes the foodborne disease listeriosis, is one example that poses a serious risk to
     the fetus and can sometimes lead to spontaneous abortion. Other pathogens that can pass the placental barrier to
     infect the fetus are known collectively by the acronym TORCH (Table 15.6).

     Transmission of infectious diseases to the baby is also a concern at the time of birth when the baby passes through
     the birth canal. Those who have active chlamydia or gonorrhea infections may expose babies the causative
     pathogens in the vagina, which can result in eye infections that lead to blindness. To prevent this, it is standard

CLINICAL FOCUS

Part 2

At the clinic, a physician takes down Michael's medical history and asks about his activities and diet over the
past week. Upon learning that Michael became sick the day after the party, the physician orders a blood test to
check for pathogens associated with foodborne diseases. After tests confirm that presence of a gram-positive
rod in Michael's blood, he is given an injection of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and sent to a nearby hospital,
where he is admitted as a patient. There he is to receive additional intravenous antibiotic therapy and fluids.

    · What portal of entry did the bacteria use to cause this infection?

Jump to the next Clinical Focus box. Go back to the previous Clinical Focus box.

Adhesion
Following the initial exposure, the pathogen adheres at the portal of entry. The term adhesion refers to the
capability of pathogenic microbes to attach to the cells of the body using adhesion factors, and different pathogens
use various mechanisms to adhere to the cells of host tissues.

Molecules (either proteins or carbohydrates) called adhesins are found on the surface of certain pathogens and
bind to specific receptors (glycoproteins) on host cells. Adhesins are present on the fimbriae and flagella of bacteria,
the cilia of protozoa, and the capsids or membranes of viruses. Protozoans can also use hooks and barbs for
adhesion; spike proteins on viruses also enhance viral adhesion. The production of glycocalyces (slime layers and
capsules) (Figure 15.7), with their high sugar and protein content, can also allow certain bacterial pathogens to
attach to cells.

6 The O in TORCH stands for "other."
606  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     Biofilm growth can also act as an adhesion factor. A biofilm is a community of bacteria that produce a glycocalyx,
     known as extrapolymeric substance (EPS), that allows the biofilm to attach to a surface. Persistent Pseudomonas
     aeruginosa infections are common in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, burn wounds, and middle-ear infections
     (otitis media) because P. aeruginosa produces a biofilm. The EPS allows the bacteria to adhere to the host cells and
     makes it harder for the host to physically remove the pathogen. The EPS not only allows for attachment but provides
     protection against the immune system and antibiotic treatments, preventing antibiotics from reaching the bacterial
     cells within the biofilm. In addition, not all bacteria in a biofilm are rapidly growing; some are in stationary phase.
     Since antibiotics are most effective against rapidly growing bacteria, portions of bacteria in a biofilm are protected
     against antibiotics.7

     catheter surface shown here. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Invasion
     Once adhesion is successful, invasion can proceed. Invasion involves the dissemination of a pathogen throughout
     local tissues or the body. Pathogens may produce exoenzymes or toxins, which serve as virulence factors that allow
     them to colonize and damage host tissues as they spread deeper into the body. Pathogens may also produce
     virulence factors that protect them against immune system defenses. A pathogen's specific virulence factors
     determine the degree of tissue damage that occurs. Figure 15.8 shows the invasion of H. pylori into the tissues of
     the stomach, causing damage as it progresses.

intracellular pathogens (meaning they can only reproduce inside of host cells) and others are facultative intracellular
pathogens (meaning they can reproduce either inside or outside of host cells). By entering the host cells,
intracellular pathogens are able to evade some mechanisms of the immune system while also exploiting the
nutrients in the host cell.

Entry to a cell can occur by endocytosis. For most kinds of host cells, pathogens use one of two different
mechanisms for endocytosis and entry. One mechanism relies on effector proteins secreted by the pathogen; these
effector proteins trigger entry into the host cell. This is the method that Salmonella and Shigella use when invading
intestinal epithelial cells. When these pathogens come in contact with epithelial cells in the intestine, they secrete
effector molecules that cause protrusions of membrane ruffles that bring the bacterial cell in. This process is called
membrane ruffling. The second mechanism relies on surface proteins expressed on the pathogen that bind to
receptors on the host cell, resulting in entry. For example, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis produces a surface protein
known as invasin that binds to beta-1 integrins expressed on the surface of host cells.

Some host cells, such as white blood cells and other phagocytes of the immune system, actively endocytose
pathogens in a process called phagocytosis. Although phagocytosis allows the pathogen to gain entry to the host
cell, in most cases, the host cell kills and degrades the pathogen by using digestive enzymes. Normally, when a
pathogen is ingested by a phagocyte, it is enclosed within a phagosome in the cytoplasm; the phagosome fuses with
a lysosome to form a phagolysosome, where digestive enzymes kill the pathogen (see Pathogen Recognition and
Phagocytosis). However, some intracellular pathogens have the ability to survive and multiply within phagocytes.
Examples include Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella; these bacteria produce proteins that lyse the phagosome
before it fuses with the lysosome, allowing the bacteria to escape into the phagocyte's cytoplasm where they can
multiply. Bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Salmonella species use a
slightly different mechanism to evade being digested by the phagocyte. These bacteria prevent the fusion of the
phagosome with the lysosome, thus remaining alive and dividing within the phagosome.

Infection
Following invasion, successful multiplication of the pathogen leads to infection. Infections can be described as local,
focal, or systemic, depending on the extent of the infection. A local infection is confined to a small area of the body,
typically near the portal of entry. For example, a hair follicle infected by Staphylococcus aureus infection may result
in a boil around the site of infection, but the bacterium is largely contained to this small location. Other examples of
local infections that involve more extensive tissue involvement include urinary tract infections confined to the
bladder or pneumonia confined to the lungs.

In a focal infection, a localized pathogen, or the toxins it produces, can spread to a secondary location. For
example, a dental hygienist nicking the gum with a sharp tool can lead to a local infection in the gum by
Streptococcus bacteria of the normal oral microbiota. These Streptococcus spp. may then gain access to the
bloodstream and make their way to other locations in the body, resulting in a secondary infection.

When an infection becomes disseminated throughout the body, we call it a systemic infection. For example,
infection by the varicella-zoster virus typically gains entry through a mucous membrane of the upper respiratory
system. It then spreads throughout the body, resulting in the classic red skin lesions associated with chickenpox.
Since these lesions are not sites of initial infection, they are signs of a systemic infection.

Sometimes a primary infection, the initial infection caused by one pathogen, can lead to a secondary infection by
another pathogen. For example, the immune system of a patient with a primary infection by HIV becomes
compromised, making the patient more susceptible to secondary diseases like oral thrush and others caused by
opportunistic pathogens. Similarly, a primary infection by Influenzavirus damages and decreases the defense
mechanisms of the lungs, making patients more susceptible to a secondary pneumonia by a bacterial pathogen like
Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Some secondary infections can even develop as a result of
treatment for a primary infection. Antibiotic therapy targeting the primary pathogen can cause collateral damage to
the normal microbiota, creating an opening for opportunistic pathogens (see Case in Point: A Secondary Yeast
Infection).
608  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

       CASE IN POINT

       A Secondary Yeast Infection

       Anita, a 36-year-old mother of three, goes to an urgent care center complaining of pelvic pressure, frequent and
       painful urination, abdominal cramps, and occasional blood-tinged urine. Suspecting a urinary tract infection
       (UTI), the physician requests a urine sample and sends it to the lab for a urinalysis. Since it will take
       approximately 24 hours to get the results of the culturing, the physician immediately starts Anita on the
       antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The next day, the microbiology lab confirms the presence of E. coli in Anita's urine,
       which is consistent with the presumptive diagnosis. However, the antimicrobial susceptibility test indicates that
       ciprofloxacin would not effectively treat Anita's UTI, so the physician prescribes a different antibiotic.

       After taking her antibiotics for 1 week, Anita returns to the clinic complaining that the prescription is not
       working. Although the painful urination has subsided, she is now experiencing vaginal itching, burning, and
       discharge. After a brief examination, the physician explains to Anita that the antibiotics were likely successful in
       killing the E. coli responsible for her UTI; however, in the process, they also wiped out many of the "good"
       bacteria in Anita's normal microbiota. The new symptoms that Anita has reported are consistent with a
       secondary yeast infection by Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungus that normally resides in the vagina but is
       inhibited by the bacteria that normally reside in the same environment.

       To confirm this diagnosis, a microscope slide of a direct vaginal smear is prepared from the discharge to check
       for the presence of yeast. A sample of the discharge accompanies this slide to the microbiology lab to determine
       if there has been an increase in the population of yeast causing vaginitis. After the microbiology lab confirms the
       diagnosis, the physician prescribes an antifungal drug for Anita to use to eliminate her secondary yeast infection.

     Transmission of Disease

     For a pathogen to persist, it must put itself in a position to be transmitted to a new host, leaving the infected host
     through a portal of exit (Figure 15.9). As with portals of entry, many pathogens are adapted to use a particular
     portal of exit. Similar to portals of entry, the most common portals of exit include the skin and the respiratory,
     urogenital, and gastrointestinal tracts. Coughing and sneezing can expel pathogens from the respiratory tract. A
     single sneeze can send thousands of virus particles into the air. Secretions and excretions can transport pathogens
     out of other portals of exit. Feces, urine, semen, vaginal secretions, tears, sweat, and shed skin cells can all serve as
     vehicles for a pathogen to leave the body. Pathogens that rely on insect vectors for transmission exit the body in the
     blood extracted by a biting insect. Similarly, some pathogens exit the body in blood extracted by needles.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how virulence factors contribute to signs and symptoms of infectious disease
    · Differentiate between endotoxins and exotoxins
    · Describe and differentiate between various types of exotoxins
    · Describe the mechanisms viruses use for adhesion and antigenic variation

In the previous section, we explained that some pathogens are more virulent than others. This is due to the unique
virulence factors produced by individual pathogens, which determine the extent and severity of disease they may
cause. A pathogen's virulence factors are encoded by genes that can be identified using molecular Koch's
postulates. When genes encoding virulence factors are inactivated, virulence in the pathogen is diminished. In this
section, we examine various types and specific examples of virulence factors and how they contribute to each step
of pathogenesis.

Virulence Factors for Adhesion

As discussed in the previous section, the first two steps in pathogenesis are exposure and adhesion. Recall that an
adhesin is a protein or glycoprotein found on the surface of a pathogen that attaches to receptors on the host cell.
Adhesins are found on bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan pathogens. One example of a bacterial adhesin is type
1 fimbrial adhesin, a molecule found on the tips of fimbriae of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Recall that fimbriae are
hairlike protein bristles on the cell surface. Type 1 fimbrial adhesin allows the fimbriae of ETEC cells to attach to the
mannose glycans expressed on intestinal epithelial cells. Table 15.7 lists common adhesins found in some of the
pathogens we have discussed or will be seeing later in this chapter.

     CLINICAL FOCUS

     Part 3

     The presence of bacteria in Michael's blood is a sign of infection, since blood is normally sterile. There is no
     indication that the bacteria entered the blood through an injury. Instead, it appears the portal of entry was the
     gastrointestinal route. Based on Michael's symptoms, the results of his blood test, and the fact that Michael was
     the only one in the family to partake of the hot dogs, the physician suspects that Michael is suffering from a case
     of listeriosis.

     Listeria monocytogenes, the facultative intracellular pathogen that causes listeriosis, is a common contaminant
     in ready-to-eat foods such as lunch meats and dairy products. Once ingested, these bacteria invade intestinal
     epithelial cells and translocate to the liver, where they grow inside hepatic cells. Listeriosis is fatal in about one
     in five normal healthy people, and mortality rates are slightly higher in patients with pre-existing conditions that
     weaken the immune response. A cluster of virulence genes encoded on a pathogenicity island is responsible for
     the pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes. These genes are regulated by a transcriptional factor known as peptide
     chain release factor 1 (PrfA). One of the genes regulated by PrfA is hyl, which encodes a toxin known as
     listeriolysin O (LLO), which allows the bacterium to escape vacuoles upon entry into a host cell. A second gene
     regulated by PrfA is actA, which encodes for a surface protein known as actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA).
     ActA is expressed on the surface of Listeria and polymerizes host actin. This enables the bacterium to produce
     actin tails, move around the cell's cytoplasm, and spread from cell to cell without exiting into the extracellular
     compartment.

     Michael's condition has begun to worsen. He is now experiencing a stiff neck and hemiparesis (weakness of one
     side of the body). Concerned that the infection is spreading, the physician decides to conduct additional tests to
     determine what is causing these new symptoms.

         · What kind of pathogen causes listeriosis, and what virulence factors contribute to the signs and symptoms
             Michael is experiencing?

             symptoms?

     Bacterial Exoenzymes and Toxins as Virulence Factors

     After exposure and adhesion, the next step in pathogenesis is invasion, which can involve enzymes and toxins. Many
     pathogens achieve invasion by entering the bloodstream, an effective means of dissemination because blood
     vessels pass close to every cell in the body. The downside of this mechanism of dispersal is that the blood also
     includes numerous elements of the immune system. Various terms ending in -emia are used to describe the

presence of pathogens in the bloodstream. The presence of bacteria in blood is called bacteremia. Bacteremia
involving pyogens (pus-forming bacteria) is called pyemia. When viruses are found in the blood, it is called viremia.
The term toxemia describes the condition when toxins are found in the blood. If bacteria are both present and
multiplying in the blood, this condition is called septicemia.

Patients with septicemia are described as septic, which can lead to shock, a life-threatening decrease in blood
pressure (systolic pressure <90 mm Hg) that prevents cells and organs from receiving enough oxygen and nutrients.
Some bacteria can cause shock through the release of toxins (virulence factors that can cause tissue damage) and
lead to low blood pressure. Gram-negative bacteria are engulfed by immune system phagocytes, which then release
tumor necrosis factor, a molecule involved in inflammation and fever. Tumor necrosis factor binds to blood
capillaries to increase their permeability, allowing fluids to pass out of blood vessels and into tissues, causing
swelling, or edema (Figure 15.10). With high concentrations of tumor necrosis factor, the inflammatory reaction is
severe and enough fluid is lost from the circulatory system that blood pressure decreases to dangerously low levels.
This can have dire consequences because the heart, lungs, and kidneys rely on normal blood pressure for proper
function; thus, multi-organ failure, shock, and death can occur.

FIGURE 15.10 This patient has edema in the tissue of the right hand. Such swelling can occur when bacteria cause the release of pro-
inflammatory molecules from immune cells and these molecules cause an increased permeability of blood vessels, allowing fluid to escape
the bloodstream and enter tissue.

Exoenzymes
Some pathogens produce extracellular enzymes, or exoenzymes, that enable them to invade host cells and deeper
tissues. Exoenzymes have a wide variety of targets. Some general classes of exoenzymes and associated pathogens
are listed in Table 15.8. Each of these exoenzymes functions in the context of a particular tissue structure to
facilitate invasion or support its own growth and defend against the immune system. For example, hyaluronidase S,
an enzyme produced by pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Clostridium
perfringens, degrades the glycoside hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid), which acts as an intercellular cement between
adjacent cells in connective tissue (Figure 15.11). This allows the pathogen to pass through the tissue layers at the
portal of entry and disseminate elsewhere in the body (Figure 15.11).

     FIGURE 15.11 (a) Hyaluronan is a polymer found in the layers of epidermis that connect adjacent cells. (b) Hyaluronidase produced by
     bacteria degrades this adhesive polymer in the extracellular matrix, allowing passage between cells that would otherwise be blocked.

     Pathogen-produced nucleases, such as DNAse produced by S. aureus, degrade extracellular DNA as a means of
     escape and spreading through tissue. As bacterial and host cells die at the site of infection, they lyse and release
     their intracellular contents. The DNA chromosome is the largest of the intracellular molecules, and masses of
     extracellular DNA can trap bacteria and prevent their spread. S. aureus produces a DNAse to degrade the mesh of
     extracellular DNA so it can escape and spread to adjacent tissues. This strategy is also used by S. aureus and other
     pathogens to degrade and escape webs of extracellular DNA produced by immune system phagocytes to trap the
     bacteria.

     Enzymes that degrade the phospholipids of cell membranes are called phospholipases. Their actions are specific in
     regard to the type of phospholipids they act upon and where they enzymatically cleave the molecules. The pathogen
     responsible for anthrax, B. anthracis, produces phospholipase C. When B. anthracis is ingested by phagocytic cells
     of the immune system, phospholipase C degrades the membrane of the phagosome before it can fuse with the
     lysosome, allowing the pathogen to escape into the cytoplasm and multiply. Phospholipases can also target the
     membrane that encloses the phagosome within phagocytic cells. As described earlier in this chapter, this is the
     mechanism used by intracellular pathogens such as L. monocytogenes and Rickettsia to escape the phagosome and
     multiply within the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells. The role of phospholipases in bacterial virulence is not restricted
     to phagosomal escape. Many pathogens produce phospholipases that act to degrade cell membranes and cause
     lysis of target cells. These phospholipases are involved in lysis of red blood cells, white blood cells, and tissue cells.

Bacterial pathogens also produce various protein-digesting enzymes, or proteases. Proteases can be classified
according to their substrate target (e.g., serine proteases target proteins with the amino acid serine) or if they
contain metals in their active site (e.g., zinc metalloproteases contain a zinc ion, which is necessary for enzymatic
activity).

One example of a protease that contains a metal ion is the exoenzyme collagenase. Collagenase digests collagen,
the dominant protein in connective tissue. Collagen can be found in the extracellular matrix, especially near mucosal
membranes, blood vessels, nerves, and in the layers of the skin. Similar to hyaluronidase, collagenase allows the
pathogen to penetrate and spread through the host tissue by digesting this connective tissue protein. C. perfringens
then uses toxins and a phospholipase to cause cellular lysis and necrosis. Once the host cells have died, the
bacterium produces gas by fermenting the muscle carbohydrates. The widespread necrosis of tissue and
accompanying gas are characteristic of the condition known as gas gangrene (Figure 15.12). Although a rare event,
collagenase can allow C. perfringens to spread to the bloodstream, causing a dangerous septicemia with a high
mortality rate

FIGURE 15.12 The illustration depicts a blood vessel with a single layer of endothelial cells surrounding the lumen and dense connective
tissue (shown in red) surrounding the endothelial cell layer. Collagenase produced by C. perfringens degrades the collagen between the
endothelial cells, allowing the bacteria to enter the bloodstream. (credit illustration: modification of work by Bruce Blaus; credit

Toxins
In addition to exoenzymes, certain pathogens are able to produce toxins, biological poisons that assist in their
ability to invade and cause damage to tissues. The ability of a pathogen to produce toxins to cause damage to host
cells is called toxigenicity.

Toxins can be categorized as endotoxins or exotoxins. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found on the outer membrane of
gram-negative bacteria is called endotoxin (Figure 15.13). During infection and disease, gram-negative bacterial
pathogens release endotoxin either when the cell dies, resulting in the disintegration of the membrane, or when the
bacterium undergoes binary fission. The lipid component of endotoxin, lipid A, is responsible for the toxic properties
of the LPS molecule. Lipid A is relatively conserved across different genera of gram-negative bacteria; therefore, the
toxic properties of lipid A are similar regardless of the gram-negative pathogen. In a manner similar to that of tumor
necrosis factor, lipid A triggers the immune system's inflammatory response (see Inflammation and Fever). If the
concentration of endotoxin in the body is low, the inflammatory response may provide the host an effective defense
against infection; on the other hand, high concentrations of endotoxin in the blood can cause an excessive
inflammatory response, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure, multi-organ failure, and death.
614  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     FIGURE 15.13 Lipopolysaccharide is composed of lipid A, a core glycolipid, and an O-specific polysaccharide side chain. Lipid A is the toxic
     component that promotes inflammation and fever.

     A classic method of detecting endotoxin is by using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test. In this procedure, the
     blood cells (amebocytes) of the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) is mixed with a patient's serum. The
     amebocytes will react to the presence of any endotoxin. This reaction can be observed either chromogenically
     (color) or by looking for coagulation (clotting reaction) to occur within the serum. An alternative method that has
     been used is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that uses antibodies to detect the presence of
     endotoxin.

     Unlike the toxic lipid A of endotoxin, exotoxins are protein molecules that are produced by a wide variety of living
     pathogenic bacteria. Although some gram-negative pathogens produce exotoxins, the majority are produced by
     gram-positive pathogens. Exotoxins differ from endotoxin in several other key characteristics, summarized in Table
     15.9. In contrast to endotoxin, which stimulates a general systemic inflammatory response when released,
     exotoxins are much more specific in their action and the cells they interact with. Each exotoxin targets specific
     receptors on specific cells and damages those cells through unique molecular mechanisms. Endotoxin remains
     stable at high temperatures, and requires heating at 121 °C (250 °F) for 45 minutes to inactivate. By contrast, most
     exotoxins are heat labile because of their protein structure, and many are denatured (inactivated) at temperatures
     above 41 °C (106 °F). As discussed earlier, endotoxin can stimulate a lethal inflammatory response at very high
     concentrations and has a measured LD50 of 0.24 mg/kg. By contrast, very small concentrations of exotoxins can be
     lethal. For example, botulinum toxin, which causes botulism, has an LD50 of 0.000001 mg/kg (240,000 times more
     lethal than endotoxin).

The intracellular targeting toxins comprise two components: A for activity and B for binding. Thus, these types of
toxins are known as A-B exotoxins (Figure 15.14). The B component is responsible for the cellular specificity of the
toxin and mediates the initial attachment of the toxin to specific cell surface receptors. Once the A-B toxin binds to
616  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     the host cell, it is brought into the cell by endocytosis and entrapped in a vacuole. The A and B subunits separate as
     the vacuole acidifies. The A subunit then enters the cell cytoplasm and interferes with the specific internal cellular
     function that it targets.

     FIGURE 15.14 (a) In A-B toxins, the B component binds to the host cell through its interaction with specific cell surface receptors. (b) The
     toxin is brought in through endocytosis. (c) Once inside the vacuole, the A component (active component) separates from the B component
     and the A component gains access to the cytoplasm. (credit: modification of work by "Biology Discussion Forum"/YouTube)

     Four unique examples of A-B toxins are the diphtheria, cholera, botulinum, and tetanus toxins. The diphtheria toxin
     is produced by the gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of nasopharyngeal
     and cutaneous diphtheria. After the A subunit of the diphtheria toxin separates and gains access to the cytoplasm, it
     facilitates the transfer of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose onto an elongation-factor protein (EF-2) that is
     needed for protein synthesis. Hence, diphtheria toxin inhibits protein synthesis in the host cell, ultimately killing the
     cell (Figure 15.15).

     FIGURE 15.15 The mechanism of the diphtheria toxin inhibiting protein synthesis. The A subunit inactivates elongation factor 2 by
     transferring an ADP-ribose. This stops protein elongation, inhibiting protein synthesis and killing the cell.

     Cholera toxin is an enterotoxin produced by the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae and is composed of one A
     subunit and five B subunits. The mechanism of action of the cholera toxin is complex. The B subunits bind to
     receptors on the intestinal epithelial cell of the small intestine. After gaining entry into the cytoplasm of the
     epithelial cell, the A subunit activates an intracellular G protein. The activated G protein, in turn, leads to the
     activation of the enzyme adenyl cyclase, which begins to produce an increase in the concentration of cyclic AMP (a
     secondary messenger molecule). The increased cAMP disrupts the normal physiology of the intestinal epithelial
     cells and causes them to secrete excessive amounts of fluid and electrolytes into the lumen of the intestinal tract,
     resulting in severe "rice-water stool" diarrhea characteristic of cholera.

     Botulinum toxin (also known as botox) is a neurotoxin produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium

15.3 · Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens                                                                              617

botulinum. It is the most acutely toxic substance known to date. The toxin is composed of a light A subunit and
heavy protein chain B subunit. The B subunit binds to neurons to allow botulinum toxin to enter the neurons at the
neuromuscular junction. The A subunit acts as a protease, cleaving proteins involved in the neuron's release of
acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter molecule. Normally, neurons release acetylcholine to induce muscle fiber
contractions. The toxin's ability to block acetylcholine release results in the inhibition of muscle contractions,
leading to muscle relaxation. This has the potential to stop breathing and cause death. Because of its action, low
concentrations of botox are used for cosmetic and medical procedures, including the removal of wrinkles and
treatment of overactive bladder.

Another neurotoxin is tetanus toxin, which is produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium tetani. This toxin
also has a light A subunit and heavy protein chain B subunit. Unlike botulinum toxin, tetanus toxin binds to inhibitory
interneurons, which are responsible for release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA). Normally, these neurotransmitters bind to neurons at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in the
inhibition of acetylcholine release. Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of glycine and GABA from the interneuron,
resulting in permanent muscle contraction. The first symptom is typically stiffness of the jaw (lockjaw). Violent
muscle spasms in other parts of the body follow, typically culminating with respiratory failure and death. Figure
15.16 shows the actions of both botulinum and tetanus toxins.

     Membrane-disrupting toxins affect cell membrane function either by forming pores or by disrupting the
     phospholipid bilayer in host cell membranes. Two types of membrane-disrupting exotoxins are hemolysins and
     leukocidins, which form pores in cell membranes, causing leakage of the cytoplasmic contents and cell lysis. These
     toxins were originally thought to target red blood cells (erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes),
     respectively, but we now know they can affect other cells as well. The gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus
     pyogenes produces streptolysins, water-soluble hemolysins that bind to the cholesterol moieties in the host cell
     membrane to form a pore. The two types of streptolysins, O and S, are categorized by their ability to cause
     hemolysis in erythrocytes in the absence or presence of oxygen. Streptolysin O is not active in the presence of
     oxygen, whereas streptolysin S is active in the presence of oxygen. Other important pore-forming membrane-
     disrupting toxins include alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus and pneumolysin of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

     Bacterial phospholipases are membrane-disrupting toxins that degrade the phospholipid bilayer of cell
     membranes rather than forming pores. We have already discussed the phospholipases associated with B. anthracis,
     L. pneumophila, and Rickettsia species that enable these bacteria to effect the lysis of phagosomes. These same
     phospholipases are also hemolysins. Other phospholipases that function as hemolysins include the alpha toxin of
     Clostridium perfringens, phospholipase C of P. aeruginosa, and beta toxin of Staphylococcus aureus.

     Some strains of S. aureus also produce a leukocidin called Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). PVL consists of two
     subunits, S and F. The S component acts like the B subunit of an A-B exotoxin in that it binds to glycolipids on the
     outer plasma membrane of animal cells. The F-component acts like the A subunit of an A-B exotoxin and carries the
     enzymatic activity. The toxin inserts and assembles into a pore in the membrane. Genes that encode PVL are more
     frequently present in S. aureus strains that cause skin infections and pneumonia.8 PVL promotes skin infections by
     causing edema, erythema (reddening of the skin due to blood vessel dilation), and skin necrosis. PVL has also been
     shown to cause necrotizing pneumonia. PVL promotes pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects on alveolar
     leukocytes. This results in the release of enzymes from the leukocytes, which, in turn, cause damage to lung tissue.

     The third class of exotoxins is the superantigens. These are exotoxins that trigger an excessive, nonspecific
     stimulation of immune cells to secrete cytokines (chemical messengers). The excessive production of cytokines,
     often called a cytokine storm, elicits a strong immune and inflammatory response that can cause life-threatening
     high fevers, low blood pressure, multi-organ failure, shock, and death. The prototype superantigen is the toxic shock
     syndrome toxin of S. aureus. Most toxic shock syndrome cases are associated with vaginal colonization by toxin-
     producing S. aureus in menstruating females; however, colonization of other body sites can also occur. Some strains
     of Streptococcus pyogenes also produce superantigens; they are referred to as the streptococcal mitogenic
     exotoxins and the streptococcal pyrogenic toxins.

     Evading the immune system is also important to invasiveness. Bacteria use a variety of virulence factors to evade
     phagocytosis by cells of the immune system. For example, many bacteria produce capsules, which are used in
     adhesion but also aid in immune evasion by preventing ingestion by phagocytes. The composition of the capsule
     prevents immune cells from being able to adhere and then phagocytose the cell. In addition, the capsule makes the
     bacterial cell much larger, making it harder for immune cells to engulf the pathogen (Figure 15.17). A notable
     capsule-producing bacterium is the gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes
     pneumococcal pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and other respiratory tract infections. Encapsulated strains of S.
     pneumoniae are more virulent than nonencapsulated strains and are more likely to invade the bloodstream and
     cause septicemia and meningitis.

     Some pathogens can also produce proteases to protect themselves against phagocytosis. As described in Adaptive

Specific Host Defenses, the human immune system produces antibodies that bind to surface molecules found on
specific bacteria (e.g., capsules, fimbriae, flagella, LPS). This binding initiates phagocytosis and other mechanisms
of antibacterial killing and clearance. Proteases combat antibody-mediated killing and clearance by attacking and
digesting the antibody molecules (Figure 15.17).

In addition to capsules and proteases, some bacterial pathogens produce other virulence factors that allow them to
evade the immune system. The fimbriae of certain species of Streptococcus contain M protein, which alters the
surface of Streptococcus and inhibits phagocytosis by blocking the binding of the complement molecules that assist
phagocytes in ingesting bacterial pathogens. The acid-fast bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the causative
agent of tuberculosis) produces a waxy substance known as mycolic acid in its cell envelope. When it is engulfed by
phagocytes in the lung, the protective mycolic acid coat enables the bacterium to resist some of the killing
mechanisms within the phagolysosome.

the surface of pathogenic bacteria. Phagocytes then bind to the antibody, initiating phagocytosis. (c) Some bacteria also produce proteases,
virulence factors that break down host antibodies to evade phagocytosis. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention)

Some bacteria produce virulence factors that promote infection by exploiting molecules naturally produced by the
host. For example, most strains of Staphylococcus aureus produce the exoenzyme coagulase, which exploits the
natural mechanism of blood clotting to evade the immune system. Normally, blood clotting is triggered in response
to blood vessel damage; platelets begin to plug the clot, and a cascade of reactions occurs in which fibrinogen, a
soluble protein made by the liver, is cleaved into fibrin. Fibrin is an insoluble, thread-like protein that binds to blood
platelets, cross-links, and contracts to form a mesh of clumped platelets and red blood cells. The resulting clot
prevents further loss of blood from the damaged blood vessels. However, if bacteria release coagulase into the
bloodstream, the fibrinogen-to-fibrin cascade is triggered in the absence of blood vessel damage. The resulting clot
coats the bacteria in fibrin, protecting the bacteria from exposure to phagocytic immune cells circulating in the
bloodstream.

Whereas coagulase causes blood to clot, kinases have the opposite effect by triggering the conversion of
plasminogen to plasmin, which is involved in the digestion of fibrin clots. By digesting a clot, kinases allow
pathogens trapped in the clot to escape and spread, similar to the way that collagenase, hyaluronidase, and DNAse
facilitate the spread of infection. Examples of kinases include staphylokinases and streptokinases, produced by
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. It is intriguing that S. aureus can produce both
coagulase to promote clotting and staphylokinase to stimulate the digestion of clots. The action of the coagulase
provides an important protective barrier from the immune system, but when nutrient supplies are diminished or
other conditions signal a need for the pathogen to escape and spread, the production of staphylokinase can initiate
this process.

A final mechanism that pathogens can use to protect themselves against the immune system is called antigenic
variation, which is the alteration of surface proteins so that a pathogen is no longer recognized by the host's
immune system. For example, the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, contains a
surface lipoprotein known as VlsE. Because of genetic recombination during DNA replication and repair, this
bacterial protein undergoes antigenic variation. Each time fever occurs, the VlsE protein in B. burgdorferi can differ
so much that antibodies against previous VlsE sequences are not effective. It is believed that this variation in the
VlsE contributes to the ability B. burgdorferi to cause chronic disease. Another important human bacterial pathogen

     that uses antigenic variation to avoid the immune system is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes the sexually
     transmitted disease gonorrhea. This bacterium is well known for its ability to undergo antigenic variation of its type

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Resolution

       Based on Michael's reported symptoms of stiff neck and hemiparesis, the physician suspects that the infection
       may have spread to his nervous system. The physician decides to order a spinal tap to look for any bacteria that
       may have invaded the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which would normally be sterile. To perform the
       spinal tap, Michael's lower back is swabbed with an iodine antiseptic and then covered with a sterile sheet. The
       needle is aseptically removed from the manufacturer's sealed plastic packaging by the clinician's gloved hands.
       The needle is inserted and a small volume of fluid is drawn into an attached sample tube. The tube is removed,
       capped and a prepared label with Michael's data is affixed to it. This STAT (urgent or immediate analysis
       required) specimen is divided into three separate sterile tubes, each with 1 mL of CSF. These tubes are
       immediately taken to the hospital's lab, where they are analyzed in the clinical chemistry, hematology, and
       microbiology departments. The preliminary results from all three departments indicate there is a cerebrospinal
       infection occurring, with the microbiology department reporting the presence of a gram-positive rod in Michael's
       CSF.

       These results confirm what his physician had suspected: Michael's new symptoms are the result of meningitis,
       acute inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord. Because meningitis can be life
       threatening and because the first antibiotic therapy was not effective in preventing the spread of infection,
       Michael is prescribed an aggressive course of two antibiotics, ampicillin and gentamicin, to be delivered
       intravenously. Michael remains in the hospital for several days for supportive care and for observation. After a
       week, he is allowed to return home for bed rest and oral antibiotics. After 3 weeks of this treatment, he makes a
       full recovery.

     Viral Virulence

     Although viral pathogens are not similar to bacterial pathogens in terms of structure, some of the properties that
     contribute to their virulence are similar. Viruses use adhesins to facilitate adhesion to host cells, and certain
     enveloped viruses rely on antigenic variation to avoid the host immune defenses. These virulence factors are
     discussed in more detail in the following sections.

     Viral Adhesins
     One of the first steps in any viral infection is adhesion of the virus to specific receptors on the surface of cells. This
     process is mediated by adhesins that are part of the viral capsid or membrane envelope. The interaction of viral
     adhesins with specific cell receptors defines the tropism (preferential targeting) of viruses for specific cells, tissues,
     and organs in the body. The spike protein hemagglutinin found on Influenzavirus is an example of a viral adhesin; it
     allows the virus to bind to the sialic acid on the membrane of host respiratory and intestinal cells. Another viral
     adhesin is the glycoprotein gp20, found on HIV. For HIV to infect cells of the immune system, it must interact with
     two receptors on the surface of cells. The first interaction involves binding between gp120 and the CD4 cellular
     marker that is found on some essential immune system cells. However, before viral entry into the cell can occur, a
     second interaction between gp120 and one of two chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) must occur. Table 15.11
     lists the adhesins for some common viral pathogens and the specific sites to which these adhesins allow viruses to
     attach.

Antigenic Variation in Viruses
Antigenic variation also occurs in certain types of enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, which exhibit two
forms of antigenic variation: antigenic drift and antigenic shift (Figure 15.18). Antigenic drift is the result of point
mutations causing slight changes in the spike proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). On the other hand,
antigenic shift is a major change in spike proteins due to gene reassortment. This reassortment for antigenic shift
occurs typically when two different influenza viruses infect the same host.

The rate of antigenic variation in influenza viruses is very high, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize
the many different strains of Influenzavirus. Although the body may develop immunity to one strain through natural
exposure or vaccination, antigenic variation results in the continual emergence of new strains that the immune
system will not recognize. This is the main reason that vaccines against Influenzavirus must be given annually. Each
year's influenza vaccine provides protection against the most prevalent strains for that year, but new or different
strains may be more prevalent the following year.

FIGURE 15.18 Antigenic drift and antigenic shift in influenza viruses. (a) In antigenic drift, mutations in the genes for the surface proteins
neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin result in small antigenic changes over time. (b) In antigenic shift, simultaneous infection of a cell with
two different influenza viruses results in mixing of the genes. The resultant virus possesses a mixture of the proteins of the original viruses.
Influenza pandemics can often be traced to antigenic shifts.

         · Explain the difference between protozoan parasites and helminths
         · Describe how helminths evade the host immune system

     Although fungi and parasites are important pathogens causing infectious diseases, their pathogenic mechanisms
     and virulence factors are not as well characterized as those of bacteria. Despite the relative lack of detailed
     mechanisms, the stages of pathogenesis and general mechanisms of virulence involved in disease production by
     these pathogens are similar to those of bacteria.

     Fungal Virulence

     Pathogenic fungi can produce virulence factors that are similar to the bacterial virulence factors that have been
     discussed earlier in this chapter. In this section, we will look at the virulence factors associated with species of
     Candida, Cryptococcus, Claviceps, and Aspergillus.

     Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen and causative agent of oral thrush, vaginal yeast infections,
     and cutaneous candidiasis. Candida produces adhesins (surface glycoproteins) that bind to the phospholipids of
     epithelial and endothelial cells. To assist in spread and tissue invasion, Candida produces proteases and
     phospholipases (i.e., exoenzymes). One of these proteases degrades keratin, a structural protein found on epithelial
     cells, enhancing the ability of the fungus to invade host tissue. In animal studies, it has been shown that the addition
     of a protease inhibitor led to attenuation of Candida infection.9 Similarly, the phospholipases can affect the integrity
     of host cell membranes to facilitate invasion.

     The main virulence factor for Cryptococcus, a fungus that causes pneumonia and meningitis, is capsule production.
     The polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan is the principal constituent of the Cryptococcus capsule. Similar to
     encapsulated bacterial cells, encapsulated Cryptococcus cells are more resistant to phagocytosis than
     nonencapsulated Cryptococcus, which are effectively phagocytosed and, therefore, less virulent.

     Like some bacteria, many fungi produce exotoxins. Fungal toxins are called mycotoxins. Claviceps purpurea, a
     fungus that grows on rye and related grains, produces a mycotoxin called ergot toxin, an alkaloid responsible for the
     disease known as ergotism. There are two forms of ergotism: gangrenous and convulsive. In gangrenous ergotism,
     the ergot toxin causes vasoconstriction, resulting in improper blood flow to the extremities, eventually leading to
     gangrene. A famous outbreak of gangrenous ergotism occurred in Eastern Europe during the 5th century AD due to
     the consumption of rye contaminated with C. purpurea. In convulsive ergotism, the toxin targets the central nervous
     system, causing mania and hallucinations.

The mycotoxin aflatoxin is a virulence factor produced by the fungus Aspergillus, an opportunistic pathogen that can
enter the body via contaminated food or by inhalation. Inhalation of the fungus can lead to the chronic pulmonary
disease aspergillosis, characterized by fever, bloody sputum, and/or asthma. Aflatoxin acts in the host as both a
mutagen (a substance that causes mutations in DNA) and a carcinogen (a substance involved in causing cancer),
and has been associated with the development of liver cancer. Aflatoxin has also been shown to cross the blood-
placental barrier.10 A second mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus is gliotoxin. This toxin promotes virulence by
inducing host cells to self-destruct and by evading the host's immune response by inhibiting the function of
phagocytic cells as well as the pro-inflammatory response. Like Candida, Aspergillus also produces several
proteases. One is elastase, which breaks down the protein elastin found in the connective tissue of the lung, leading
to the development of lung disease. Another is catalase, an enzyme that protects the fungus from hydrogen
peroxide produced by the immune system to destroy pathogens.

Protozoan Virulence

Protozoan pathogens are unicellular eukaryotic parasites that have virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms
analogous to prokaryotic and viral pathogens, including adhesins, toxins, antigenic variation, and the ability to
survive inside phagocytic vesicles.

Protozoans often have unique features for attaching to host cells. The protozoan Giardia lamblia, which causes the
intestinal disease giardiasis, uses a large adhesive disc composed of microtubules to attach to the intestinal
mucosa. During adhesion, the flagella of G. lamblia move in a manner that draws fluid out from under the disc,
resulting in an area of lower pressure that facilitates adhesion to epithelial cells. Giardia does not invade the
intestinal cells but rather causes inflammation (possibly through the release of cytopathic substances that cause
damage to the cells) and shortens the intestinal villi, inhibiting absorption of nutrients.

Some protozoans are capable of antigenic variation. The obligate intracellular pathogen Plasmodium falciparum
(one of the causative agents of malaria) resides inside red blood cells, where it produces an adhesin membrane
protein known as PfEMP1. This protein is expressed on the surface of the infected erythrocytes, causing blood cells
to stick to each other and to the walls of blood vessels. This process impedes blood flow, sometimes leading to
organ failure, anemia, jaundice (yellowing of skin and sclera of the eyes due to buildup of bilirubin from lysed red
blood cells), and, subsequently, death. Although PfEMP1 can be recognized by the host's immune system, antigenic
variations in the structure of the protein over time prevent it from being easily recognized and eliminated. This
allows malaria to persist as a chronic infection in many individuals.

The virulence factors of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, include the abilities
to form capsules and undergo antigenic variation. T. brucei evades phagocytosis by producing a dense glycoprotein
coat that resembles a bacterial capsule. Over time, host antibodies are produced that recognize this coat, but T.
brucei is able to alter the structure of the glycoprotein to evade recognition.

Helminth Virulence

Helminths, or parasitic worms, are multicellular eukaryotic parasites that depend heavily on virulence factors that
allow them to gain entry to host tissues. For example, the aquatic larval form of Schistosoma mansoni, which causes
schistosomiasis, penetrates intact skin with the aid of proteases that degrade skin proteins, including elastin.

10 C.P. Wild et al. "In-utero exposure to aflatoxin in west Africa." Lancet 337 no. 8757 (1991):1602.
624  15 · Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity

     To survive within the host long enough to perpetuate their often-complex life cycles, helminths need to evade the
     immune system. Some helminths are so large that the immune system is ineffective against them. Others, such as
     adult roundworms (which cause trichinosis, ascariasis, and other diseases), are protected by a tough outer cuticle.

     Over the course of their life cycles, the surface characteristics of the parasites vary, which may help prevent an
     effective immune response. Some helminths express polysaccharides called glycans on their external surface;
     because these glycans resemble molecules produced by host cells, the immune system fails to recognize and attack
     the helminth as a foreign body. This "glycan gimmickry," as it has been called, serves as a protective cloak that
     allows the helminth to escape detection by the immune system.11

     In addition to evading host defenses, helminths can actively suppress the immune system. S. mansoni, for example,
     degrades host antibodies with proteases. Helminths produce many other substances that suppress elements of
     both innate nonspecific and adaptive specific host defenses. They also release large amounts of material into the
     host that may locally overwhelm the immune system or cause it to respond inappropriately.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
16.1 The Language of Epidemiologists
16.2 Tracking Infectious Diseases
16.3 Modes of Disease Transmission
16.4 Global Public Health

INTRODUCTION In the United States and other developed nations, public health is a key function of government. A
healthy citizenry is more productive, content, and prosperous; high rates of death and disease, on the other hand,
can severely hamper economic productivity and foster social and political instability. The burden of disease makes it
difficult for citizens to work consistently, maintain employment, and accumulate wealth to better their lives and
support a growing economy.
In this chapter, we will explore the intersections between microbiology and epidemiology, the science that underlies
public health. Epidemiology studies how disease originates and spreads throughout a population, with the goal of
preventing outbreaks and containing them when they do occur. Over the past two centuries, discoveries in
epidemiology have led to public health policies that have transformed life in developed nations, leading to the
eradication (or near eradication) of many diseases that were once causes of great human suffering and premature
death. However, the work of epidemiologists is far from finished. Numerous diseases continue to plague humanity,
and new diseases are always emerging. Moreover, in the developing world, lack of infrastructure continues to pose
many challenges to efforts to contain disease.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       In late November and early December, a hospital in western Florida started to see a spike in the number of
       cases of acute gastroenteritis-like symptoms. Patients began arriving at the emergency department complaining
       of excessive bouts of emesis (vomiting) and diarrhea (with no blood in the stool). They also complained of
       abdominal pain and cramping, and most were severely dehydrated. Alarmed by the number of cases, hospital
       staff made some calls and learned that other regional hospitals were also seeing 10 to 20 similar cases per day.

           · What are some possible causes of this outbreak?
           · In what ways could these cases be linked, and how could any suspected links be confirmed?

       Jump to the next Clinical Focus box.

     The field of epidemiology concerns the geographical distribution and timing of infectious disease occurrences and
     how they are transmitted and maintained in nature, with the goal of recognizing and controlling outbreaks. The
     science of epidemiology includes etiology (the study of the causes of disease) and investigation of disease
     transmission (mechanisms by which a disease is spread).

     Analyzing Disease in a Population

     Epidemiological analyses are always carried out with reference to a population, which is the group of individuals that
     are at risk for the disease or condition. The population can be defined geographically, but if only a portion of the
     individuals in that area are susceptible, additional criteria may be required. Susceptible individuals may be defined
     by particular behaviors, such as intravenous drug use, owning particular pets, or membership in an institution, such
     as a college. Being able to define the population is important because most measures of interest in epidemiology
     are made with reference to the size of the population.

     The state of being diseased is called morbidity. Morbidity in a population can be expressed in a few different ways.
     Morbidity or total morbidity is expressed in numbers of individuals without reference to the size of the population.
     The morbidity rate can be expressed as the number of diseased individuals out of a standard number of individuals
     in the population, such as 100,000, or as a percent of the population.

     There are two aspects of morbidity that are relevant to an epidemiologist: a disease's prevalence and its incidence.
     Prevalence is the number, or proportion, of individuals with a particular illness in a given population at a point in
     time. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that in 2012, there were about
     1.2 million people 13 years and older with an active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Expressed as a
     proportion, or rate, this is a prevalence of 467 infected persons per 100,000 in the population.1 On the other hand,
     incidence is the number or proportion of new cases in a period of time. For the same year and population, the CDC
     estimates that there were 43,165 newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection, which is an incidence of 13.7 new cases
     per 100,000 in the population.2 The relationship between incidence and prevalence can be seen in Figure 16.2. For
     a chronic disease like HIV infection, prevalence will generally be higher than incidence because it represents the
     cumulative number of new cases over many years minus the number of cases that are no longer active (e.g.,
     because the patient died or was cured).

In addition to morbidity rates, the incidence and prevalence of mortality (death) may also be reported. A mortality
rate can be expressed as the percentage of the population that has died from a disease or as the number of deaths
per 100,000 persons (or other suitable standard number).

FIGURE 16.2 This graph compares the incidence of HIV (the number of new cases reported each year) with the prevalence (the total
number of cases each year). Prevalence and incidence can also be expressed as a rate or proportion for a given population.

Patterns of Incidence

Diseases that are seen only occasionally, and usually without geographic concentration, are called sporadic
diseases. Examples of sporadic diseases include tetanus, rabies, and plague. In the United States, Clostridium
tetani, the bacterium that causes tetanus, is ubiquitous in the soil environment, but incidences of infection occur
only rarely and in scattered locations because most individuals are vaccinated, clean wounds appropriately, or are
only rarely in a situation that would cause infection.3 Likewise in the United States there are a few scattered cases
of plague each year, usually contracted from rodents in rural areas in the western states.4

Diseases that are constantly present (often at a low level) in a population within a particular geographic region are
called endemic diseases. For example, malaria is endemic to some regions of Brazil, but is not endemic to the
United States.

Diseases for which a larger than expected number of cases occurs in a short time within a geographic region are
called epidemic diseases. Influenza is a good example of a commonly epidemic disease. Incidence patterns of
influenza tend to rise each winter in the northern hemisphere. These seasonal increases are expected, so it would
not be accurate to say that influenza is epidemic every winter; however, some winters have an usually large number
of seasonal influenza cases in particular regions, and such situations would qualify as epidemics (Figure 16.3 and
Figure 16.4).

An epidemic disease signals the breakdown of an equilibrium in disease frequency, often resulting from some
change in environmental conditions or in the population. In the case of influenza, the disruption can be due to
antigenic shift or drift (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens), which allows influenza virus strains
to circumvent the acquired immunity of their human hosts.

  Hospital physicians suspected that some type of food poisoning was to blame for the sudden post-Thanksgiving
  outbreak of gastroenteritis in western Florida. Over a two-week period, 254 cases were observed, but by the
  end of the first week of December, the epidemic ceased just as quickly as it had started. Suspecting a link
  between the cases based on the localized nature of the outbreak, hospitals handed over their medical records to
  the regional public health office for study.

  Laboratory testing of stool samples had indicated that the infections were caused by Salmonella bacteria.
  Patients ranged from children as young as three to seniors in their late eighties. Cases were nearly evenly split
  between males and females. Across the region, there had been three confirmed deaths in the outbreak, all due
  to severe dehydration. In each of the fatal cases, the patients had not sought medical care until their symptoms
  were severe; also, all of the deceased had preexisting medical conditions such as congestive heart failure,
  diabetes, or high blood pressure.

  After reviewing the medical records, epidemiologists with the public health office decided to conduct interviews
  with a randomly selected sample of patients.

Etiology

When studying an epidemic, an epidemiologist's first task is to determinate the cause of the disease, called the
etiologic agent or causative agent. Connecting a disease to a specific pathogen can be challenging because of the
extra effort typically required to demonstrate direct causation as opposed to a simple association. It is not enough
to observe an association between a disease and a suspected pathogen; controlled experiments are needed to
eliminate other possible causes. In addition, pathogens are typically difficult to detect when there is no immediate
clue as to what is causing the outbreak. Signs and symptoms of disease are also commonly nonspecific, meaning
that many different agents can give rise to the same set of signs and symptoms. This complicates diagnosis even
when a causative agent is familiar to scientists.

Robert Koch was the first scientist to specifically demonstrate the causative agent of a disease (anthrax) in the late
1800s. Koch developed four criteria, now known as Koch's postulates, which had to be met in order to positively link
a disease with a pathogenic microbe. Without Koch's postulates, the Golden Age of Microbiology would not have
occurred. Between 1876 and 1905, many common diseases were linked with their etiologic agents, including
cholera, diphtheria, gonorrhea, meningitis, plague, syphilis, tetanus, and tuberculosis. Today, we use the molecular
Koch's postulates, a variation of Koch's original postulates that can be used to establish a link between the disease
state and virulence traits unique to a pathogenic strain of a microbe. Koch's original postulates and molecular Koch's
postulates were described in more detail in How Pathogens Cause Disease.

     The Role of Public Health Organizations

     The main national public health agency in the United States is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
     (CDC), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC is charged with protecting the public
     from disease and injury. One way that the CDC carries out this mission is by overseeing the National Notifiable
     Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) in cooperation with regional, state, and territorial public health departments.
     The NNDSS monitors diseases considered to be of public health importance on a national scale. Such diseases are
     called notifiable diseases or reportable diseases because all cases must be reported to the CDC. A physician
     treating a patient with a notifiable disease is legally required to submit a report on the case. Notifiable diseases
     include HIV infection, measles, West Nile virus infections, and many others. Some states have their own lists of
     notifiable diseases that include diseases beyond those on the CDC's list.

     Notifiable diseases are tracked by epidemiological studies and the data is used to inform health-care providers and
     the public about possible risks. The CDC publishes the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), which
     provides physicians and health-care workers with updates on public health issues and the latest data pertaining to
     notifiable diseases. Table 16.1 is an example of the kind of data contained in the MMWR.

     Epidemiology has its roots in the work of physicians who looked for patterns in disease occurrence as a way to
     understand how to prevent it. The idea that disease could be transmitted was an important precursor to making
     sense of some of the patterns. In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro first proposed the germ theory of disease in his essay
     De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis, but this theory remained in competition with other theories, such as the
     miasma hypothesis, for many years (see What Our Ancestors Knew). Uncertainty about the cause of disease was not

an absolute barrier to obtaining useful knowledge from patterns of disease. Some important researchers, such as
Florence Nightingale, subscribed to the miasma hypothesis. The transition to acceptance of the germ theory during
the 19th century provided a solid mechanistic grounding to the study of disease patterns. The studies of 19th
century physicians and researchers such as John Snow, Florence Nightingale, Ignaz Semmelweis, Joseph Lister,
Robert Koch, Louis Pasteur, and others sowed the seeds of modern epidemiology.

Pioneers of Epidemiology

John Snow (Figure 16.5) was a British physician known as the father of epidemiology for determining the source of
the 1854 Broad Street cholera epidemic in London. Based on observations he had made during an earlier cholera
outbreak (1848-1849), Snow proposed that cholera was spread through a fecal-oral route of transmission and that
a microbe was the infectious agent. He investigated the 1854 cholera epidemic in two ways. First, suspecting that
contaminated water was the source of the epidemic, Snow identified the source of water for those infected. He
found a high frequency of cholera cases among individuals who obtained their water from the River Thames
downstream from London. This water contained the refuse and sewage from London and settlements upstream. He
also noted that brewery workers did not contract cholera and on investigation found the owners provided the
workers with beer to drink and stated that they likely did not drink water.5 Second, he also painstakingly mapped
the incidence of cholera and found a high frequency among those individuals using a particular water pump located
on Broad Street. In response to Snow's advice, local officials removed the pump's handle,6 resulting in the
containment of the Broad Street cholera epidemic.

Snow's work represents an early epidemiological study and it resulted in the first known public health response to
an epidemic. Snow's meticulous case-tracking methods are now common practice in studying disease outbreaks
and in associating new diseases with their causes. His work further shed light on unsanitary sewage practices and
the effects of waste dumping in the Thames. Additionally, his work supported the germ theory of disease, which
argued disease could be transmitted through contaminated items, including water contaminated with fecal matter.

Snow's work illustrated what is referred to today as a common source spread of infectious disease, in which there
is a single source for all of the individuals infected. In this case, the single source was the contaminated well below
the Broad Street pump. Types of common source spread include point source spread, continuous common source
spread, and intermittent common source spread. In point source spread of infectious disease, the common source
operates for a short time period--less than the incubation period of the pathogen. An example of point source
spread is a single contaminated potato salad at a group picnic. In continuous common source spread, the infection
occurs for an extended period of time, longer than the incubation period. An example of continuous common source
spread would be the source of London water taken downstream of the city, which was continuously contaminated
with sewage from upstream. Finally, with intermittent common source spread, infections occur for a period, stop,
and then begin again. This might be seen in infections from a well that was contaminated only after large rainfalls
and that cleared itself of contamination after a short period.

In contrast to common source spread, propagated spread occurs through direct or indirect person-to-person
contact. With propagated spread, there is no single source for infection; each infected individual becomes a source
for one or more subsequent infections. With propagated spread, unless the spread is stopped immediately,
infections occur for longer than the incubation period. Although point sources often lead to large-scale but localized
outbreaks of short duration, propagated spread typically results in longer duration outbreaks that can vary from
small to large, depending on the population and the disease (Figure 16.6). In addition, because of person-to-person
transmission, propagated spread cannot be easily stopped at a single source like point source spread.

     Florence Nightingale's work is another example of an early epidemiological study. In 1854, Nightingale was part of a
     contingent of nurses dispatched by the British military to care for wounded soldiers during the Crimean War.
     Nightingale kept meticulous records regarding the causes of illness and death during the war. Her recordkeeping
     was a fundamental task of what would later become the science of epidemiology. Her analysis of the data she
     collected was published in 1858. In this book, she presented monthly frequency data on causes of death in a wedge
     chart histogram (Figure 16.7). This graphical presentation of data, unusual at the time, powerfully illustrated that
     the vast majority of casualties during the war occurred not due to wounds sustained in action but to what
     Nightingale deemed preventable infectious diseases. Often these diseases occurred because of poor sanitation and
     lack of access to hospital facilities. Nightingale's findings led to many reforms in the British military's system of
     medical care.

Joseph Lister provided early epidemiological evidence leading to good public health practices in clinics and
hospitals. These settings were notorious in the mid-1800s for fatal infections of surgical wounds at a time when the
germ theory of disease was not yet widely accepted (see Foundations of Modern Cell Theory). Most physicians did
not wash their hands between patient visits or clean and sterilize their surgical tools. Lister, however, discovered the
disinfecting properties of carbolic acid, also known as phenol (see Using Chemicals to Control Microorganisms). He
introduced several disinfection protocols that dramatically lowered post-surgical infection rates.7 He demanded
that surgeons who worked for him use a 5% carbolic acid solution to clean their surgical tools between patients, and
even went so far as to spray the solution onto bandages and over the surgical site during operations (Figure 16.8).
He also took precautions not to introduce sources of infection from his skin or clothing by removing his coat, rolling
up his sleeves, and washing his hands in a dilute solution of carbolic acid before and during the surgery.

     Types of Epidemiological Studies

     Today, epidemiologists make use of study designs, the manner in which data are gathered to test a hypothesis,
     similar to those of researchers studying other phenomena that occur in populations. These approaches can be
     divided into observational studies (in which subjects are not manipulated) and experimental studies (in which
     subjects are manipulated). Collectively, these studies give modern-day epidemiologists multiple tools for exploring
     the connections between infectious diseases and the populations of susceptible individuals they might infect.

     Observational Studies
     In an observational study, data are gathered from study participants through measurements (such as physiological
     variables like white blood cell count), or answers to questions in interviews (such as recent travel or exercise
     frequency). The subjects in an observational study are typically chosen at random from a population of affected or
     unaffected individuals. However, the subjects in an observational study are in no way manipulated by the
     researcher. Observational studies are typically easier to carry out than experimental studies, and in certain
     situations they may be the only studies possible for ethical reasons.

     Observational studies are only able to measure associations between disease occurrence and possible causative
     agents; they do not necessarily prove a causal relationship. For example, suppose a study finds an association
     between heavy coffee drinking and lower incidence of skin cancer. This might suggest that coffee prevents skin
     cancer, but there may be another unmeasured factor involved, such as the amount of sun exposure the participants
     receive. If it turns out that coffee drinkers work more in offices and spend less time outside in the sun than those
     who drink less coffee, then it may be possible that the lower rate of skin cancer is due to less sun exposure, not to
     coffee consumption. The observational study cannot distinguish between these two potential causes.

     There are several useful approaches in observational studies. These include methods classified as descriptive
     epidemiology and analytical epidemiology. Descriptive epidemiology gathers information about a disease
     outbreak, the affected individuals, and how the disease has spread over time in an exploratory stage of study. This
     type of study will involve interviews with patients, their contacts, and their family members; examination of samples
     and medical records; and even histories of food and beverages consumed. Such a study might be conducted while
     the outbreak is still occurring. Descriptive studies might form the basis for developing a hypothesis of causation that
     could be tested by more rigorous observational and experimental studies.

     Analytical epidemiology employs carefully selected groups of individuals in an attempt to more convincingly
     evaluate hypotheses about potential causes for a disease outbreak. The selection of cases is generally made at
     random, so the results are not biased because of some common characteristic of the study participants. Analytical
     studies may gather their data by going back in time (retrospective studies), or as events unfold forward in time
     (prospective studies).

     Retrospective studies gather data from the past on present-day cases. Data can include things like the medical
     history, age, gender, or occupational history of the affected individuals. This type of study examines associations

16.2 · Tracking Infectious Diseases                                                                                        639

between factors chosen or available to the researcher and disease occurrence.

Prospective studies follow individuals and monitor their disease state during the course of the study. Data on the
characteristics of the study subjects and their environments are gathered at the beginning and during the study so
that subjects who become ill may be compared with those who do not. Again, the researchers can look for
associations between the disease state and variables that were measured during the study to shed light on possible
causes.

Analytical studies incorporate groups into their designs to assist in teasing out associations with disease.
Approaches to group-based analytical studies include cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional
studies. The cohort method examines groups of individuals (called cohorts) who share a particular characteristic.
For example, a cohort might consist of individuals born in the same year and the same place; or it might consist of
people who practice or avoid a particular behavior, e.g., smokers or nonsmokers. In a cohort study, cohorts can be
followed prospectively or studied retrospectively. If only a single cohort is followed, then the affected individuals are
compared with the unaffected individuals in the same group. Disease outcomes are recorded and analyzed to try to
identify correlations between characteristics of individuals in the cohort and disease incidence. Cohort studies are a
useful way to determine the causes of a condition without violating the ethical prohibition of exposing subjects to a
risk factor. Cohorts are typically identified and defined based on suspected risk factors to which individuals have
already been exposed through their own choices or circumstances.

Case-control studies are typically retrospective and compare a group of individuals with a disease to a similar
group of individuals without the disease. Case-control studies are far more efficient than cohort studies because
researchers can deliberately select subjects who are already affected with the disease as opposed to waiting to see
which subjects from a random sample will develop a disease.

A cross-sectional study analyzes randomly selected individuals in a population and compares individuals affected
by a disease or condition to those unaffected at a single point in time. Subjects are compared to look for
associations between certain measurable variables and the disease or condition. Cross-sectional studies are also
used to determine the prevalence of a condition.

Experimental Studies
Experimental epidemiology uses laboratory or clinical studies in which the investigator manipulates the study
subjects to study the connections between diseases and potential causative agents or to assess treatments.
Examples of treatments might be the administration of a drug, the inclusion or exclusion of different dietary items,
physical exercise, or a particular surgical procedure. Animals or humans are used as test subjects. Because
experimental studies involve manipulation of subjects, they are typically more difficult and sometimes impossible
for ethical reasons.

Koch's postulates require experimental interventions to determine the causative agent for a disease. Unlike
observational studies, experimental studies can provide strong evidence supporting cause because other factors are
typically held constant when the researcher manipulates the subject. The outcomes for one group receiving the
treatment are compared to outcomes for a group that does not receive the treatment but is treated the same in
every other way. For example, one group might receive a regimen of a drug administered as a pill, while the
untreated group receives a placebo (a pill that looks the same but has no active ingredient). Both groups are treated
as similarly as possible except for the administration of the drug. Because other variables are held constant in both
the treated and the untreated groups, the researcher is more certain that any change in the treated group is a result
of the specific manipulation.

Experimental studies provide the strongest evidence for the etiology of disease, but they must also be designed
carefully to eliminate subtle effects of bias. Typically, experimental studies with humans are conducted as double-
blind studies, meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is a treatment case and who is not. This
design removes a well-known cause of bias in research called the placebo effect, in which knowledge of the
treatment by either the subject or the researcher can influence the outcomes.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 3

       Since laboratory tests had confirmed Salmonella, a common foodborne pathogen, as the etiologic agent,
       epidemiologists suspected that the outbreak was caused by contamination at a food processing facility serving
       the region. Interviews with patients focused on food consumption during and after the Thanksgiving holiday,
       corresponding with the timing of the outbreak. During the interviews, patients were asked to list items
       consumed at holiday gatherings and describe how widely each item was consumed among family members and
       relatives. They were also asked about the sources of food items (e.g., brand, location of purchase, date of
       purchase). By asking such questions, health officials hoped to identify patterns that would lead back to the
       source of the outbreak.

       Analysis of the interview responses eventually linked almost all of the cases to consumption of a holiday dish
       known as the turducken--a chicken stuffed inside a duck stuffed inside a turkey. Turducken is a dish not
       generally consumed year-round, which would explain the spike in cases just after the Thanksgiving holiday.
       Additional analysis revealed that the turduckens consumed by the affected patients were purchased already
       stuffed and ready to be cooked. Moreover, the pre-stuffed turduckens were all sold at the same regional grocery
       chain under two different brand names. Upon further investigation, officials traced both brands to a single
       processing plant that supplied stores throughout the Florida panhandle.

     16.3 Modes of Disease Transmission

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the different types of disease reservoirs
         · Compare contact, vector, and vehicle modes of transmission
         · Identify important disease vectors
         · Explain the prevalence of nosocomial infections

     Understanding how infectious pathogens spread is critical to preventing infectious disease. Many pathogens require
     a living host to survive, while others may be able to persist in a dormant state outside of a living host. But having
     infected one host, all pathogens must also have a mechanism of transfer from one host to another or they will die
     when their host dies. Pathogens often have elaborate adaptations to exploit host biology, behavior, and ecology to
     live in and move between hosts. Hosts have evolved defenses against pathogens, but because their rates of
     evolution are typically slower than their pathogens (because their generation times are longer), hosts are usually at
     an evolutionary disadvantage. This section will explore where pathogens survive--both inside and outside
     hosts--and some of the many ways they move from one host to another.

     Reservoirs and Carriers

     For pathogens to persist over long periods of time they require reservoirs where they normally reside. Reservoirs
     can be living organisms or nonliving sites. Nonliving reservoirs can include soil and water in the environment. These
     may naturally harbor the organism because it may grow in that environment. These environments may also become
     contaminated with pathogens in human feces, pathogens shed by intermediate hosts, or pathogens contained in the
     remains of intermediate hosts.

Pathogens may have mechanisms of dormancy or resilience that allow them to survive (but typically not to
reproduce) for varying periods of time in nonliving environments. For example, Clostridium tetani survives in the soil
and in the presence of oxygen as a resistant endospore. Although many viruses are soon destroyed once in contact
with air, water, or other non-physiological conditions, certain types are capable of persisting outside of a living cell
for varying amounts of time. For example, a study that looked at the ability of influenza viruses to infect a cell culture
after varying amounts of time on a banknote showed survival times from 48 hours to 17 days, depending on how
they were deposited on the banknote.8 On the other hand, cold-causing rhinoviruses are somewhat fragile, typically
surviving less than a day outside of physiological fluids.

A human acting as a reservoir of a pathogen may or may not be capable of transmitting the pathogen, depending on
the stage of infection and the pathogen. To help prevent the spread of disease among school children, the CDC has
developed guidelines based on the risk of transmission during the course of the disease. For example, children with
chickenpox are considered contagious for five days from the start of the rash, whereas children with most
gastrointestinal illnesses should be kept home for 24 hours after the symptoms disappear.

An individual capable of transmitting a pathogen without displaying symptoms is referred to as a carrier. A passive
carrier is contaminated with the pathogen and can mechanically transmit it to another host; however, a passive
carrier is not infected. For example, a health-care professional who fails to wash his hands after seeing a patient
harboring an infectious agent could become a passive carrier, transmitting the pathogen to another patient who
becomes infected.

By contrast, an active carrier is an infected individual who can transmit the disease to others. An active carrier may
or may not exhibit signs or symptoms of infection. For example, active carriers may transmit the disease during the
incubation period (before they show signs and symptoms) or the period of convalescence (after symptoms have
subsided). Active carriers who do not present signs or symptoms of disease despite infection are called
asymptomatic carriers. Pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus, and HIV are frequently
transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. Mary Mallon, better known as Typhoid Mary, is a famous historical example of
an asymptomatic carrier. An Irish immigrant, Mallon worked as a cook for households in and around New York City
between 1900 and 1915. In each household, the residents developed typhoid fever (caused by Salmonella typhi) a
few weeks after Mallon started working. Later investigations determined that Mallon was responsible for at least
122 cases of typhoid fever, five of which were fatal.9 See Eye on Ethics: Typhoid Mary for more about the Mallon
case.

A pathogen may have more than one living reservoir. In zoonotic diseases, animals act as reservoirs of human
disease and transmit the infectious agent to humans through direct or indirect contact. In some cases, the disease
also affects the animal, but in other cases the animal is asymptomatic.

In parasitic infections, the parasite's preferred host is called the definitive host. In parasites with complex life
cycles, the definitive host is the host in which the parasite reaches sexual maturity. Some parasites may also infect
one or more intermediate hosts in which the parasite goes through several immature life cycle stages or
reproduces asexually.

         · Explain the difference between a passive carrier and an active carrier.

     Transmission

     Regardless of the reservoir, transmission must occur for an infection to spread. First, transmission from the reservoir
     to the individual must occur. Then, the individual must transmit the infectious agent to other susceptible individuals,
     either directly or indirectly. Pathogenic microorganisms employ diverse transmission mechanisms.

     Contact Transmission
     Contact transmission includes direct contact or indirect contact. Person-to-person transmission is a form of direct
     contact transmission. Here the agent is transmitted by physical contact between two individuals (Figure 16.9)
     through actions such as touching, kissing, sexual intercourse, or droplet sprays. Direct contact can be categorized as
     vertical, horizontal, or droplet transmission. Vertical direct contact transmission occurs when pathogens are
     transmitted to a fetus or infant during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Other kinds of direct contact transmission
     are called horizontal direct contact transmission. Often, contact between mucous membranes is required for entry
     of the pathogen into the new host, although skin-to-skin contact can lead to mucous membrane contact if the new
     host subsequently touches a mucous membrane. Contact transmission may also be site-specific; for example, some
     diseases can be transmitted by sexual contact but not by other forms of contact.

     When an individual coughs or sneezes, small droplets of mucus that may contain pathogens are ejected. This leads
     to direct droplet transmission, which refers to droplet transmission of a pathogen to a new host over distances of
     one meter or less. A wide variety of diseases are transmitted by droplets, including influenza and many forms of
     pneumonia. Transmission over distances greater than one meter is called airborne transmission.

     Indirect contact transmission involves inanimate objects called fomites that become contaminated by pathogens
     from an infected individual or reservoir (Figure 16.10). For example, an individual with the common cold may
     sneeze, causing droplets to land on a fomite such as a tablecloth or carpet, or the individual may wipe her nose and
     then transfer mucus to a fomite such as a doorknob or towel. Transmission occurs indirectly when a new susceptible
     host later touches the fomite and transfers the contaminated material to a susceptible portal of entry. Fomites can
     also include objects used in clinical settings that are not properly sterilized, such as syringes, needles, catheters,
     and surgical equipment. Pathogens transmitted indirectly via such fomites are a major cause of healthcare-
     associated infections (see Controlling Microbial Growth).

     FIGURE 16.9 Direct contact transmission of pathogens can occur through physical contact. Many pathogens require contact with a mucous
     membrane to enter the body, but the host may transfer the pathogen from another point of contact (e.g., hand) to a mucous membrane
     (e.g., mouth or eye). (credit left: modification of work by Lisa Doehnert)

Vehicle Transmission
The term vehicle transmission refers to the transmission of pathogens through vehicles such as water, food, and
air. Water contamination through poor sanitation methods leads to waterborne transmission of disease. Waterborne
disease remains a serious problem in many regions throughout the world. The World Health Organization (WHO)
estimates that contaminated drinking water is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths each year.10 Similarly,
food contaminated through poor handling or storage can lead to foodborne transmission of disease (Figure 16.11).

Dust and fine particles known as aerosols, which can float in the air, can carry pathogens and facilitate the airborne
transmission of disease. For example, dust particles are the dominant mode of transmission of hantavirus to
humans. Hantavirus is found in mouse feces, urine, and saliva, but when these substances dry, they can disintegrate
into fine particles that can become airborne when disturbed; inhalation of these particles can lead to a serious and
sometimes fatal respiratory infection.

Although droplet transmission over short distances is considered contact transmission as discussed above, longer
distance transmission of droplets through the air is considered vehicle transmission. Unlike larger particles that drop
quickly out of the air column, fine mucus droplets produced by coughs or sneezes can remain suspended for long
periods of time, traveling considerable distances. In certain conditions, droplets desiccate quickly to produce a
droplet nucleus that is capable of transmitting pathogens; air temperature and humidity can have an impact on
effectiveness of airborne transmission.

Tuberculosis is often transmitted via airborne transmission when the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
is released in small particles with coughs. Because tuberculosis requires as few as 10 microbes to initiate a new
infection, patients with tuberculosis must be treated in rooms equipped with special ventilation, and anyone
entering the room should wear a mask.

FIGURE 16.11 Food is an important vehicle of transmission for pathogens, especially of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory systems.

  which requested an expedited inspection of the facility by state inspectors. Inspectors found that a machine

       used to process the chicken was contaminated with Salmonella as a result of substandard cleaning protocols.
       Inspectors also found that the process of stuffing and packaging the turduckens prior to refrigeration allowed
       the meat to remain at temperatures conducive to bacterial growth for too long. The contamination and the
       delayed refrigeration led to vehicle (food) transmission of the bacteria in turduckens.

       Based on these findings, the plant was shut down for a full and thorough decontamination. All turduckens
       produced in the plant were recalled and pulled from store shelves ahead of the December holiday season,
       preventing further outbreaks.

       Go back to the previous Clinical Focus Box.

     Vector Transmission
     Diseases can also be transmitted by a mechanical or biological vector, an animal (typically an arthropod) that carries
     the disease from one host to another. Mechanical transmission is facilitated by a mechanical vector, an animal
     that carries a pathogen from one host to another without being infected itself. For example, a fly may land on fecal
     matter and later transmit bacteria from the feces to food that it lands on; a human eating the food may then become
     infected by the bacteria, resulting in a case of diarrhea or dysentery (Figure 16.12).

     Biological transmission occurs when the pathogen reproduces within a biological vector that transmits the
     pathogen from one host to another (Figure 16.12). Arthropods are the main vectors responsible for biological
     transmission (Figure 16.13). Most arthropod vectors transmit the pathogen by biting the host, creating a wound that
     serves as a portal of entry. The pathogen may go through part of its reproductive cycle in the gut or salivary glands of
     the arthropod to facilitate its transmission through the bite. For example, hemipterans (called "kissing bugs" or
     "assassin bugs") transmit Chagas disease to humans by defecating when they bite, after which the human scratches
     or rubs the infected feces into a mucous membrane or break in the skin.

     Biological insect vectors include mosquitoes, which transmit malaria and other diseases, and lice, which transmit
     typhus. Other arthropod vectors can include arachnids, primarily ticks, which transmit Lyme disease and other
     diseases, and mites, which transmit scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. Biological transmission, because it involves
     survival and reproduction within a parasitized vector, complicates the biology of the pathogen and its transmission.
     There are also important non-arthropod vectors of disease, including mammals and birds. Various species of
     mammals can transmit rabies to humans, usually by means of a bite that transmits the rabies virus. Chickens and
     other domestic poultry can transmit avian influenza to humans through direct or indirect contact with avian
     influenza virus A shed in the birds' saliva, mucous, and feces.

EYE ON ETHICS

Using GMOs to Stop the Spread of Zika

In 2016, an epidemic of the Zika virus was linked to a high incidence of birth defects in South America and
Central America. As winter turned to spring in the northern hemisphere, health officials correctly predicted the
virus would spread to North America, coinciding with the breeding season of its major vector, the Aedes aegypti
mosquito.

The range of the A. aegypti mosquito extends well into the southern United States (Figure 16.14). Because these
same mosquitoes serve as vectors for other problematic diseases (dengue fever, yellow fever, and others),
various methods of mosquito control have been proposed as solutions. Chemical pesticides have been used
effectively in the past, and are likely to be used again; but because chemical pesticides can have negative
impacts on the environment, some scientists have proposed an alternative that involves genetically engineering
A. aegypti so that it cannot reproduce. This method, however, has been the subject of some controversy.

One method that has worked in the past to control pests, with little apparent downside, has been sterile male
introductions. This method controlled the screw-worm fly pest in the southwest United States and fruit fly pests
of fruit crops. In this method, males of the target species are reared in the lab, sterilized with radiation, and
released into the environment where they mate with wild females, who subsequently bear no live offspring.
Repeated releases shrink the pest population.

A similar method, taking advantage of recombinant DNA technology,11 introduces a dominant lethal allele into
male mosquitoes that is suppressed in the presence of tetracycline (an antibiotic) during laboratory rearing. The
males are released into the environment and mate with female mosquitoes. Unlike the sterile male method,
these matings produce offspring, but they die as larvae from the lethal gene in the absence of tetracycline in the
environment. As of 2016, this method has yet to be implemented in the United States, but a UK company tested
the method in Piracicaba, Brazil, and found an 82% reduction in wild A. aegypti larvae and a 91% reduction in
dengue cases in the treated area.12 In August 2016, amid news of Zika infections in several Florida
communities, the FDA gave the UK company permission to test this same mosquito control method in Key West,
Florida, pending compliance with local and state regulations and a referendum in the affected communities.

The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to control a disease vector has its advocates as well as its
opponents. In theory, the system could be used to drive the A. aegypti mosquito extinct--a noble goal according
to some, given the damage they do to human populations.13 But opponents of the idea are concerned that the
gene could escape the species boundary of A. aegypti and cause problems in other species, leading to
unforeseen ecological consequences. Opponents are also wary of the program because it is being administered
by a for-profit corporation, creating the potential for conflicts of interest that would have to be tightly regulated;
and it is not clear how any unintended consequences of the program could be reversed.

There are other epidemiological considerations as well. Aedes aegypti is apparently not the only vector for the
Zika virus. Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is also a vector for the Zika virus.14 A. albopictus is now
widespread around the planet including much of the United States (Figure 16.14). Many other mosquitoes have
been found to harbor Zika virus, though their capacity to act as vectors is unknown.15 Genetically modified
strains of A. aegypti will not control the other species of vectors. Finally, the Zika virus can apparently be
transmitted sexually between human hosts, during pregnancy to a fetus or during birth, and possibly through
blood transfusion. All of these factors must be considered in any approach to controlling the spread of the virus.

     Clearly there are risks and unknowns involved in conducting an open-environment experiment of an as-yet
     poorly understood technology. But allowing the Zika virus to spread unchecked is also risky. Does the threat of a
     Zika epidemic justify the ecological risk of genetically engineering mosquitos? Are current methods of mosquito
     control sufficiently ineffective or harmful that we need to try untested alternatives? These are the questions
     being put to public health officials now.

        includes much of the United States, from the Southwest and Southeast to as far north as the Mid-Atlantic. The range of A. albopictus,
        another vector, extends even farther north to New England and parts of the Midwest. (credit micrograph: modification of work by

     Quarantining

     Individuals suspected or known to have been exposed to certain contagious pathogens may be quarantined, or
     isolated to prevent transmission of the disease to others. Hospitals and other health-care facilities generally set up
     special wards to isolate patients with particularly hazardous diseases such as tuberculosis or Ebola (Figure 16.15).
     Depending on the setting, these wards may be equipped with special air-handling methods, and personnel may
     implement special protocols to limit the risk of transmission, such as personal protective equipment or the use of
     chemical disinfectant sprays upon entry and exit of medical personnel.

     The duration of the quarantine depends on factors such as the incubation period of the disease and the evidence
     suggestive of an infection. The patient may be released if signs and symptoms fail to materialize when expected or if
     preventive treatment can be administered in order to limit the risk of transmission. If the infection is confirmed, the
     patient may be compelled to remain in isolation until the disease is no longer considered contagious.

     In the United States, public health authorities may only quarantine patients for certain diseases, such as cholera,
     diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, and strains of influenza capable of causing a pandemic. Individuals entering the
     United States or moving between states may be quarantined by the CDC if they are suspected of having been
     exposed to one of these diseases. Although the CDC routinely monitors entry points to the United States for crew or
     passengers displaying illness, quarantine is rarely implemented.

     During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine became a common practice, particularly related to international travel.

Various countries implemented quarantine and isolation requirements based on the availability of testing and
vaccinations. Initially, some nations required that all international travelers remain quarantined for a period after
arrival; later on, they instituted quarantine only for those who tested positive.

Healthcare-Associated (Nosocomial) Infections

Hospitals, retirement homes, and prisons attract the attention of epidemiologists because these settings are
associated with increased incidence of certain diseases. Higher rates of transmission may be caused by
characteristics of the environment itself, characteristics of the population, or both. Consequently, special efforts
must be taken to limit the risks of infection in these settings.

Infections acquired in health-care facilities, including hospitals, are called nosocomial infections or healthcare-
associated infections (HAI). HAIs are often connected with surgery or other invasive procedures that provide the
pathogen with access to the portal of infection. For an infection to be classified as an HAI, the patient must have
been admitted to the health-care facility for a reason other than the infection. In these settings, patients suffering
from primary disease are often afflicted with compromised immunity and are more susceptible to secondary
infection and opportunistic pathogens.

In 2011, more than 720,000 HAIs occurred in hospitals in the United States, according to the CDC. About 22% of
these HAIs occurred at a surgical site, and cases of pneumonia accounted for another 22%; urinary tract infections
accounted for an additional 13%, and primary bloodstream infections 10%.16 Such HAIs often occur when
pathogens are introduced to patients' bodies through contaminated surgical or medical equipment, such as
catheters and respiratory ventilators. Health-care facilities seek to limit nosocomial infections through training and
hygiene protocols such as those described in Control of Microbial Growth.

A large number of international programs and agencies are involved in efforts to promote global public health.
Among their goals are developing infrastructure in health care, public sanitation, and public health capacity;

     monitoring infectious disease occurrences around the world; coordinating communications between national public
     health agencies in various countries; and coordinating international responses to major health crises. In large part,
     these international efforts are necessary because disease-causing microorganisms know no national boundaries.

     The World Health Organization (WHO)

     International public health issues are coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), an agency of the
     United Nations. Of its roughly $4 billion budget for 2015-1617 , about $1 billion was funded by member states and
     the remaining $3 billion by voluntary contributions. In addition to monitoring and reporting on infectious disease,
     WHO also develops and implements strategies for their control and prevention. WHO has had a number of
     successful international public health campaigns. For example, its vaccination program against smallpox, begun in
     the mid-1960s, resulted in the global eradication of the disease by 1980. WHO continues to be involved in infectious
     disease control, primarily in the developing world, with programs targeting malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis,
     among others. It also runs programs to reduce illness and mortality that occur as a result of violence, accidents,
     lifestyle-associated illnesses such as diabetes, and poor health-care infrastructure.

     WHO maintains a global alert and response system that coordinates information from member nations. In the event
     of a public health emergency or epidemic, it provides logistical support and coordinates international response to
     the emergency. The United States contributes to this effort through the CDC. The CDC carries out international
     monitoring and public health efforts, mainly in the service of protecting US public health in an increasingly
     connected world. Similarly, the European Union maintains a Health Security Committee that monitors disease
     outbreaks within its member countries and internationally, coordinating with WHO.

     Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases

     Both WHO and some national public health agencies such as the CDC monitor and prepare for emerging infectious
     diseases. An emerging infectious disease is either new to the human population or has shown an increase in
     prevalence in the previous twenty years. Whether the disease is new or conditions have changed to cause an
     increase in frequency, its status as emerging implies the need to apply resources to understand and control its
     growing impact.

     Emerging diseases may change their frequency gradually over time, or they may experience sudden epidemic
     growth. The importance of vigilance was made clear during the Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic in western Africa
     through 2014-2015. Although health experts had been aware of the Ebola virus since the 1970s, an outbreak on
     such a large scale had never happened before (Figure 16.16). Previous human epidemics had been small, isolated,
     and contained. Indeed, the gorilla and chimpanzee populations of western Africa had suffered far worse from Ebola
     than the human population. The pattern of small isolated human epidemics changed in 2014. Its high transmission
     rate, coupled with cultural practices for treatment of the dead and perhaps its emergence in an urban setting,
     caused the disease to spread rapidly, and thousands of people died. The international public health community
     responded with a large emergency effort to treat patients and contain the epidemic.

     Emerging diseases are found in all countries, both developed and developing (Table 16.2). Some nations are better
     equipped to deal with them. National and international public health agencies watch for epidemics like the Ebola
     outbreak in developing countries because those countries rarely have the health-care infrastructure and expertise to
     deal with large outbreaks effectively. Even with the support of international agencies, the systems in western Africa
     struggled to identify and care for the sick and control spread. In addition to the altruistic goal of saving lives and
     assisting nations lacking in resources, the global nature of transportation means that an outbreak anywhere can
     spread quickly to every corner of the planet. Managing an epidemic in one location--its source--is far easier than
     fighting it on many fronts.

     Ebola is not the only disease that needs to be monitored in the global environment. In 2015, WHO set priorities on

several emerging diseases that had a high probability of causing epidemics and that were poorly understood (and
thus urgently required research and development efforts).

A reemerging infectious disease is a disease that is increasing in frequency after a previous period of decline. Its
reemergence may be a result of changing conditions or old prevention regimes that are no longer working. Examples
of such diseases are drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, and malaria. Drug-resistant strains
of the bacteria causing gonorrhea and syphilis are also becoming more widespread, raising concerns of untreatable
infections.

     SARS Outbreak and Identification

     On November 16, 2002, the first case of a SARS outbreak was reported in Guangdong Province, China. The patient
     exhibited influenza-like symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, sore throat, and shortness of breath. As the
     number of cases grew, the Chinese government was reluctant to openly communicate information about the
     epidemic with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international community. The slow reaction of Chinese
     public health officials to this new disease contributed to the spread of the epidemic within and later outside China.
     In April 2003, the Chinese government finally responded with a huge public health effort involving quarantines,
     medical checkpoints, and massive cleaning projects. Over 18,000 people were quarantined in Beijing alone. Large
     funding initiatives were created to improve health-care facilities, and dedicated outbreak teams were created to
     coordinate the response. By August 16, 2003, the last SARS patients were released from a hospital in Beijing nine
     months after the first case was reported in China.

     In the meantime, SARS spread to other countries on its way to becoming a global pandemic. Though the infectious
     agent had yet to be identified, it was thought to be an influenza virus. The disease was named SARS, an acronym for
     severe acute respiratory syndrome, until the etiologic agent could be identified. Travel restrictions to Southeast Asia
     were enforced by many countries. By the end of the outbreak, there were 8,098 cases and 774 deaths worldwide.
     China and Hong Kong were hit hardest by the epidemic, but Taiwan, Singapore, and Toronto, Canada, also saw
     significant numbers of cases.

     Fortunately, timely public health responses in many countries effectively suppressed the outbreak and led to its
     eventual containment. For example, the disease was introduced to Canada in February 2003 by an infected traveler
     from Hong Kong, who died shortly after being hospitalized. By the end of March, hospital isolation and home
     quarantine procedures were in place in the Toronto area, stringent anti-infection protocols were introduced in
     hospitals, and the media were actively reporting on the disease. Public health officials tracked down contacts of
     infected individuals and quarantined them. A total of 25,000 individuals were quarantined in the city. Thanks to the
     vigorous response of the Canadian public health community, SARS was brought under control in Toronto by June, a
     mere four months after it was introduced.

     In 2003, WHO established a collaborative effort to identify the causative agent of SARS, which has now been
     identified as a coronavirus that was associated with horseshoe bats. The genome of the SARS virus was sequenced

Netherlands confirmed the etiology of the disease by fulfilling Koch's postulates for the SARS coronavirus. The last
known case of SARS worldwide was reported in 2004.

Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

FIGURE 17.1 Varicella, or chickenpox, is caused by the highly contagious varicella-zoster virus. The characteristic rash seen here is partly a

INTRODUCTION Despite relatively constant exposure to pathogenic microbes in the environment, humans do not
generally suffer from constant infection or disease. Under most circumstances, the body is able to defend itself from
the threat of infection thanks to a complex immune system designed to repel, kill, and expel disease-causing
invaders. Immunity as a whole can be described as two interrelated parts: nonspecific innate immunity, which is the
subject of this chapter, and specific adaptive host defenses, which are discussed in the next chapter.
The nonspecific innate immune response provides a first line of defense that can often prevent infections from
gaining a solid foothold in the body. These defenses are described as nonspecific because they do not target any
specific pathogen; rather, they defend against a wide range of potential pathogens. They are called innate because
they are built-in mechanisms of the human organism. Unlike the specific adaptive defenses, they are not acquired
over time and they have no "memory" (they do not improve after repeated exposures to specific pathogens).
660  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     Broadly speaking, nonspecific innate defenses provide an immediate (or very rapid) response against potential
     pathogens. However, these responses are neither perfect nor impenetrable. They can be circumvented by
     pathogens on occasion, and sometimes they can even cause damage to the body, contributing to the signs and
     symptoms of infection (Figure 17.1).

       Angela, a 25-year-old female patient in the emergency department, is having some trouble communicating
       verbally because of shortness of breath. A nurse observes constriction and swelling of the airway and labored
       breathing. The nurse asks Angela if she has a history of asthma or allergies. Angela shakes her head no, but
       there is fear in her eyes. With some difficulty, she explains that her father died suddenly at age 27, when she
       was just a little girl, of a similar respiratory attack. The underlying cause had never been identified.

     Nonspecific innate immunity can be characterized as a multifaceted system of defenses that targets invading
     pathogens in a nonspecific manner. In this chapter, we have divided the numerous defenses that make up this
     system into three categories: physical defenses, chemical defenses, and cellular defenses. However, it is important
     to keep in mind that these defenses do not function independently, and the categories often overlap. Table 17.1
     provides an overview of the nonspecific defenses discussed in this chapter.

Physical defenses provide the body's most basic form of nonspecific defense. They include physical barriers to
microbes, such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as mechanical defenses that physically remove
microbes and debris from areas of the body where they might cause harm or infection. In addition, the microbiome
provides a measure of physical protection against disease, as microbes of the normal microbiota compete with
pathogens for nutrients and cellular binding sites necessary to cause infection.

Physical Barriers

Physical barriers play an important role in preventing microbes from reaching tissues that are susceptible to
infection. At the cellular level, barriers consist of cells that are tightly joined to prevent invaders from crossing
through to deeper tissue. For example, the endothelial cells that line blood vessels have very tight cell-to-cell
junctions, blocking microbes from gaining access to the bloodstream. Cell junctions are generally composed of cell
membrane proteins that may connect with the extracellular matrix or with complementary proteins from
neighboring cells. Tissues in various parts of the body have different types of cell junctions. These include tight
junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions, as illustrated in Figure 17.2. Invading microorganisms may attempt to
break down these substances chemically, using enzymes such as proteases that can cause structural damage to
create a point of entry for pathogens.

FIGURE 17.2 There are multiple types of cell junctions in human tissue, three of which are shown here. Tight junctions rivet two adjacent
cells together, preventing or limiting material exchange through the spaces between them. Desmosomes have intermediate fibers that act
like shoelaces, tying two cells together, allowing small materials to pass through the resulting spaces. Gap junctions are channels between
two cells that permit their communication via signals. (credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)

The Skin Barrier
One of the body's most important physical barriers is the skin barrier, which is composed of three layers of closely
packed cells. The thin upper layer is called the epidermis. A second, thicker layer, called the dermis, contains hair
follicles, sweat glands, nerves, and blood vessels. A layer of fatty tissue called the hypodermis lies beneath the
dermis and contains blood and lymph vessels (Figure 17.3).
662  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     FIGURE 17.3 Human skin has three layers, the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis, which provide a thick barrier between microbes
     outside the body and deeper tissues. Dead skin cells on the surface of the epidermis are continually shed, taking with them microbes on the
     skin's surface. (credit: modification of work by National Institutes of Health)

     The topmost layer of skin, the epidermis, consists of cells that are packed with keratin. These dead cells remain as a
     tightly connected, dense layer of protein-filled cell husks on the surface of the skin. The keratin makes the skin's
     surface mechanically tough and resistant to degradation by bacterial enzymes. Fatty acids on the skin's surface
     create a dry, salty, and acidic environment that inhibits the growth of some microbes and is highly resistant to
     breakdown by bacterial enzymes. In addition, the dead cells of the epidermis are frequently shed, along with any
     microbes that may be clinging to them. Shed skin cells are continually replaced with new cells from below, providing
     a new barrier that will soon be shed in the same way.

     Infections can occur when the skin barrier is compromised or broken. A wound can serve as a point of entry for
     opportunistic pathogens, which can infect the skin tissue surrounding the wound and possibly spread to deeper
     tissues.

       CASE IN POINT

       Every Rose Has its Thorn

       Mike, a gardener from southern California, recently noticed a small red bump on his left forearm. Initially, he did
       not think much of it, but soon it grew larger and then ulcerated (opened up), becoming a painful lesion that
       extended across a large part of his forearm (Figure 17.4). He went to an urgent care facility, where a physician
       asked about his occupation. When he said he was a landscaper, the physician immediately suspected a case of
       sporotrichosis, a type of fungal infection known as rose gardener's disease because it often afflicts landscapers
       and gardening enthusiasts.

       Under most conditions, fungi cannot produce skin infections in healthy individuals. Fungi grow filaments known
       as hyphae, which are not particularly invasive and can be easily kept at bay by the physical barriers of the skin
       and mucous membranes. However, small wounds in the skin, such as those caused by thorns, can provide an
       opening for opportunistic pathogens like Sporothrix schenkii, a soil-dwelling fungus and the causative agent of
       rose gardener's disease. Once it breaches the skin barrier, S. schenkii can infect the skin and underlying tissues,
       producing ulcerated lesions like Mike's. Compounding matters, other pathogens may enter the infected tissue,
       causing secondary bacterial infections.

       Luckily, rose gardener's disease is treatable. Mike's physician wrote him a prescription for some antifungal drugs
       as well as a course of antibiotics to combat secondary bacterial infections. His lesions eventually healed, and

   Control and Prevention)

Mucous Membranes
The mucous membranes lining the nose, mouth, lungs, and urinary and digestive tracts provide another nonspecific
barrier against potential pathogens. Mucous membranes consist of a layer of epithelial cells bound by tight
junctions. The epithelial cells secrete a moist, sticky substance called mucus, which covers and protects the more
fragile cell layers beneath it and traps debris and particulate matter, including microbes. Mucus secretions also
contain antimicrobial peptides.

In many regions of the body, mechanical actions serve to flush mucus (along with trapped or dead microbes) out of
the body or away from potential sites of infection. For example, in the respiratory system, inhalation can bring
microbes, dust, mold spores, and other small airborne debris into the body. This debris becomes trapped in the
mucus lining the respiratory tract, a layer known as the mucociliary blanket. The epithelial cells lining the upper
parts of the respiratory tract are called ciliated epithelial cells because they have hair-like appendages known as
cilia. Movement of the cilia propels debris-laden mucus out and away from the lungs. The expelled mucus is then
swallowed and destroyed in the stomach, or coughed up, or sneezed out (Figure 17.5). This system of removal is
often called the mucociliary escalator.

FIGURE 17.5 This scanning electron micrograph shows ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells from the human trachea. The mucociliary
escalator pushes mucus away from the lungs, along with any debris or microorganisms that may be trapped in the sticky mucus, and the
664  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     mucus moves up to the esophagus where it can be removed by swallowing.

     The mucociliary escalator is such an effective barrier to microbes that the lungs, the lowermost (and most sensitive)
     portion of the respiratory tract, were long considered to be a sterile environment in healthy individuals. Only recently
     has research suggested that healthy lungs may have a small normal microbiota. Disruption of the mucociliary
     escalator by the damaging effects of smoking or diseases such as cystic fibrosis can lead to increased colonization
     of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract and frequent infections, which highlights the importance of this physical
     barrier to host defenses.

     Like the respiratory tract, the digestive tract is a portal of entry through which microbes enter the body, and the
     mucous membranes lining the digestive tract provide a nonspecific physical barrier against ingested microbes. The
     intestinal tract is lined with epithelial cells, interspersed with mucus-secreting goblet cells (Figure 17.6). This mucus
     mixes with material received from the stomach, trapping foodborne microbes and debris. The mechanical action of
     peristalsis, a series of muscular contractions in the digestive tract, moves the sloughed mucus and other material
     through the intestines, rectum, and anus, excreting the material in feces.

     FIGURE 17.6 Goblet cells produce and secrete mucus. The arrows in this micrograph point to the mucus-secreting goblet cells
     (magnification 1600) in the intestinal epithelium. (credit micrograph: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan
     Medical School © 2012)

     Endothelia
     The epithelial cells lining the urogenital tract, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and certain other tissues are known
     as endothelia. These tightly packed cells provide a particularly effective frontline barrier against invaders. The
     endothelia of the blood-brain barrier, for example, protect the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the
     brain and the spinal cord. The CNS is one of the most sensitive and important areas of the body, as microbial
     infection of the CNS can quickly lead to serious and often fatal inflammation. The cell junctions in the blood vessels
     traveling through the CNS are some of the tightest and toughest in the body, preventing any transient microbes in
     the bloodstream from entering the CNS. This keeps the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds and bathes the brain and
     spinal cord sterile under normal conditions.

Mechanical Defenses

In addition to physical barriers that keep microbes out, the body has a number of mechanical defenses that
physically remove pathogens from the body, preventing them from taking up residence. We have already discussed
several examples of mechanical defenses, including the shedding of skin cells, the expulsion of mucus via the
mucociliary escalator, and the excretion of feces through intestinal peristalsis. Other important examples of
mechanical defenses include the flushing action of urine and tears, which both serve to carry microbes away from
the body. The flushing action of urine is largely responsible for the normally sterile environment of the urinary tract,
which includes the kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder. Urine passing out of the body washes out transient
microorganisms, preventing them from taking up residence. The eyes also have physical barriers and mechanical
mechanisms for preventing infections. The eyelashes and eyelids prevent dust and airborne microorganisms from
reaching the surface of the eye. Any microbes or debris that make it past these physical barriers may be flushed out
by the mechanical action of blinking, which bathes the eye in tears, washing debris away (Figure 17.7).

FIGURE 17.7 Tears flush microbes away from the surface of the eye. Urine washes microbes out of the urinary tract as it passes through; as
a result, the urinary system is normally sterile.

    · Name two mechanical defenses that protect the eyes.

Microbiome

In various regions of the body, resident microbiota serve as an important first-line defense against invading
pathogens. Through their occupation of cellular binding sites and competition for available nutrients, the resident
microbiota prevent the critical early steps of pathogen attachment and proliferation required for the establishment
of an infection. For example, in the vagina, members of the resident microbiota compete with opportunistic
pathogens like the yeast Candida. This competition prevents infections by limiting the availability of nutrients, thus
inhibiting the growth of Candida, keeping its population in check. Similar competitions occur between the
microbiota and potential pathogens on the skin, in the upper respiratory tract, and in the gastrointestinal tract. As
666  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     will be discussed later in this chapter, the resident microbiota also contribute to the chemical defenses of the innate
     nonspecific host defenses.

     The importance of the normal microbiota in host defenses is highlighted by the increased susceptibility to infectious
     diseases when the microbiota is disrupted or eliminated. Treatment with antibiotics can significantly deplete the
     normal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, providing an advantage for pathogenic bacteria to colonize and cause
     diarrheal infection. In the case of diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile, the infection can be severe and potentially
     lethal. One strategy for treating C. difficile infections is fecal transplantation, which involves the transfer of fecal
     material from a donor (screened for potential pathogens) into the intestines of the recipient patient as a method of
     restoring the normal microbiota and combating C. difficile infections.

     Table 17.2 provides a summary of the physical defenses discussed in this section.

             phase proteins
         · Describe similarities and differences among classic, alternate, and lectin complement pathways

     In addition to physical defenses, the innate nonspecific immune system uses a number of chemical mediators that
     inhibit microbial invaders. The term "chemical mediators" encompasses a wide array of substances found in various
     body fluids and tissues throughout the body. Chemical mediators may work alone or in conjunction with each other
     to inhibit microbial colonization and infection.

     Some chemical mediators are endogenously produced, meaning they are produced by human body cells; others are
     produced exogenously, meaning that they are produced by certain microbes that are part of the microbiome. Some
     mediators are produced continually, bathing the area in the antimicrobial substance; others are produced or
     activated primarily in response to some stimulus, such as the presence of microbes.

     Chemical and Enzymatic Mediators Found in Body Fluids

     Fluids produced by the skin include examples of both endogenous and exogenous mediators. Sebaceous glands in
     the dermis secrete an oil called sebum that is released onto the skin surface through hair follicles. This sebum is an
     endogenous mediator, providing an additional layer of defense by helping seal off the pore of the hair follicle,
     preventing bacteria on the skin's surface from invading sweat glands and surrounding tissue (Figure 17.8). Certain

members of the microbiome, such as the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes and the fungus Malassezia, among
others, can use lipase enzymes to degrade sebum, using it as a food source. This produces oleic acid, which creates
a mildly acidic environment on the surface of the skin that is inhospitable to many pathogenic microbes. Oleic acid is
an example of an exogenously produced mediator because it is produced by resident microbes and not directly by
body cells.

also a food source for resident microbes that produce oleic acid, an exogenously produced mediator. (credit micrograph: Micrograph

Environmental factors that affect the microbiota of the skin can have a direct impact on the production of chemical
mediators. Low humidity or decreased sebum production, for example, could make the skin less habitable for
microbes that produce oleic acid, thus making the skin more susceptible to pathogens normally inhibited by the
skin's low pH. Many skin moisturizers are formulated to counter such effects by restoring moisture and essential oils
to the skin.

The digestive tract also produces a large number of chemical mediators that inhibit or kill microbes. In the oral
cavity, saliva contains mediators such as lactoperoxidase enzymes, and mucus secreted by the esophagus contains
the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme. In the stomach, highly acidic gastric fluid kills most microbes. In the lower
digestive tract, the intestines have pancreatic and intestinal enzymes, antibacterial peptides (cryptins), bile
produced from the liver, and specialized Paneth cells that produce lysozyme. Together, these mediators are able to
eliminate most pathogens that manage to survive the acidic environment of the stomach.

In the urinary tract, urine flushes microbes out of the body during urination. Furthermore, the slight acidity of urine
(the average pH is about 6) inhibits the growth of many microbes and potential pathogens in the urinary tract.

The female reproductive system employs lactate, an exogenously produced chemical mediator, to inhibit microbial
growth. The cells and tissue layers composing the vagina produce glycogen, a branched and more complex polymer
of glucose. Lactobacilli in the area ferment glycogen to produce lactate, lowering the pH in the vagina and inhibiting
transient microbiota, opportunistic pathogens like Candida (a yeast associated with vaginal infections), and other
pathogens responsible for sexually transmitted diseases.

In the eyes, tears contain the chemical mediators lysozyme and lactoferrin, both of which are capable of eliminating
microbes that have found their way to the surface of the eyes. Lysozyme cleaves the bond between NAG and NAM in
peptidoglycan, a component of the cell wall in bacteria. It is more effective against gram-positive bacteria, which
lack the protective outer membrane associated with gram-negative bacteria. Lactoferrin inhibits microbial growth by
chemically binding and sequestering iron. This effectually starves many microbes that require iron for growth.

In the ears, cerumen (earwax) exhibits antimicrobial properties due to the presence of fatty acids, which lower the
pH to between 3 and 5.

     The respiratory tract uses various chemical mediators in the nasal passages, trachea, and lungs. The mucus
     produced in the nasal passages contains a mix of antimicrobial molecules similar to those found in tears and saliva
     (e.g., lysozyme, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase). Secretions in the trachea and lungs also contain lysozyme and
     lactoferrin, as well as a diverse group of additional chemical mediators, such as the lipoprotein complex called
     surfactant, which has antibacterial properties.

     Antimicrobial Peptides

     The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a special class of nonspecific cell-derived mediators with broad-spectrum
     antimicrobial properties. Some AMPs are produced routinely by the body, whereas others are primarily produced (or
     produced in greater quantities) in response to the presence of an invading pathogen. Research has begun exploring
     how AMPs can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

     AMPs may induce cell damage in microorganisms in a variety of ways, including by inflicting damage to membranes,
     destroying DNA and RNA, or interfering with cell-wall synthesis. Depending on the specific antimicrobial
     mechanism, a particular AMP may inhibit only certain groups of microbes (e.g., gram-positive or gram-negative
     bacteria) or it may be more broadly effective against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Many AMPs are found on
     the skin, but they can also be found in other regions of the body.

     A family of AMPs called defensins can be produced by epithelial cells throughout the body as well as by cellular
     defenses such as macrophages and neutrophils (see Cellular Defenses). Defensins may be secreted or act inside
     host cells; they combat microorganisms by damaging their plasma membranes. AMPs called bacteriocins are
     produced exogenously by certain members of the resident microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. The genes
     coding for these types of AMPs are often carried on plasmids and can be passed between different species within
     the resident microbiota through lateral or horizontal gene transfer.

     There are numerous other AMPs throughout the body. The characteristics of a few of the more significant AMPs are
     summarized in Table 17.3.

    · Why are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) considered nonspecific defenses?

Plasma Protein Mediators

Many nonspecific innate immune factors are found in plasma, the fluid portion of blood. Plasma contains
electrolytes, sugars, lipids, and proteins, each of which helps to maintain homeostasis (i.e., stable internal body
functioning), and contains the proteins involved in the clotting of blood. Additional proteins found in blood plasma,
such as acute-phase proteins, complement proteins, and cytokines, are involved in the nonspecific innate immune
response.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Plasma versus Serum

There are two terms for the fluid portion of blood: plasma and serum. How do they differ if they are both fluid and
lack cells? The fluid portion of blood left over after coagulation (blood cell clotting) has taken place is serum.
Although molecules such as many vitamins, electrolytes, certain sugars, complement proteins, and antibodies are
still present in serum, clotting factors are largely depleted. Plasma, conversely, still contains all the clotting
elements. To obtain plasma from blood, an anticoagulant must be used to prevent clotting. Examples of
anticoagulants include heparin and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). Because clotting is inhibited, once
obtained, the sample must be gently spun down in a centrifuge. The heavier, denser blood cells form a pellet at the
bottom of a centrifuge tube, while the fluid plasma portion, which is lighter and less dense, remains above the cell
pellet.

Acute-Phase Proteins
The acute-phase proteins are another class of antimicrobial mediators. Acute-phase proteins are primarily
produced in the liver and secreted into the blood in response to inflammatory molecules from the immune system.
Examples of acute-phase proteins include C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, ferritin, transferrin, fibrinogen, and
mannose-binding lectin. Each of these proteins has a different chemical structure and inhibits or destroys microbes
in some way (Table 17.4).

               TABLE 17.4

     The Complement System
     The complement system is a group of plasma protein mediators that can act as an innate nonspecific defense while
     also serving to connect innate and adaptive immunity (discussed in the next chapter). The complement system is
     composed of more than 30 proteins (including C1 through C9) that normally circulate as precursor proteins in blood.
     These precursor proteins become activated when stimulated or triggered by a variety of factors, including the
     presence of microorganisms. Complement proteins are considered part of innate nonspecific immunity because
     they are always present in the blood and tissue fluids, allowing them to be activated quickly. Also, when activated
     through the alternative pathway (described later in this section), complement proteins target pathogens in a
     nonspecific manner.

     The process by which circulating complement precursors become functional is called complement activation. This
     process is a cascade that can be triggered by one of three different mechanisms, known as the alternative, classical,
     and lectin pathways.

     The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous activation of the complement protein C3. The hydrolysis of
     C3 produces two products, C3a and C3b. When no invader microbes are present, C3b is very quickly degraded in a
     hydrolysis reaction using the water in the blood. However, if invading microbes are present, C3b attaches to the
     surface of these microbes. Once attached, C3b will recruit other complement proteins in a cascade (Figure 17.9).

     The classical pathway provides a more efficient mechanism of activating the complement cascade, but it depends
     upon the production of antibodies by the specific adaptive immune defenses. To initiate the classical pathway, a
     specific antibody must first bind to the pathogen to form an antibody-antigen complex. This activates the first
     protein in the complement cascade, the C1 complex. The C1 complex is a multipart protein complex, and each
     component participates in the full activation of the overall complex. Following recruitment and activation of the C1
     complex, the remaining classical pathway complement proteins are recruited and activated in a cascading sequence
     (Figure 17.9).

     The lectin activation pathway is similar to the classical pathway, but it is triggered by the binding of mannose-
     binding lectin, an acute-phase protein, to carbohydrates on the microbial surface. Like other acute-phase proteins,
     lectins are produced by liver cells and are commonly upregulated in response to inflammatory signals received by
     the body during an infection (Figure 17.9).

17.2 · Chemical Defenses                                                                                                                    671

FIGURE 17.9 The three complement activation pathways have different triggers, as shown here, but all three result in the activation of the
complement protein C3, which produces C3a and C3b. The latter binds to the surface of the target cell and then works with other
complement proteins to cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b also binds to the cell surface and then recruits C6 through C9; these molecules
form a ring structure called the membrane attack complex (MAC), which punches through the cell membrane of the invading pathogen,
causing it to swell and burst.

Although each complement activation pathway is initiated in a different way, they all provide the same protective
outcomes: opsonization, inflammation, chemotaxis, and cytolysis. The term opsonization refers to the coating of a
pathogen by a chemical substance (called an opsonin) that allows phagocytic cells to recognize, engulf, and destroy
it more easily. Opsonins from the complement cascade include C1q, C3b, and C4b. Additional important opsonins
include mannose-binding proteins and antibodies. The complement fragments C3a and C5a are well-characterized
anaphylatoxins with potent proinflammatory functions. Anaphylatoxins activate mast cells, causing degranulation
and the release of inflammatory chemical signals, including mediators that cause vasodilation and increased
vascular permeability. C5a is also one of the most potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and other white blood
cells, cellular defenses that will be discussed in the next section.

The complement proteins C6, C7, C8, and C9 assemble into a membrane attack complex (MAC), which allows C9
to polymerize into pores in the membranes of gram-negative bacteria. These pores allow water, ions, and other
molecules to move freely in and out of the targeted cells, eventually leading to cell lysis and death of the pathogen
(Figure 17.9). However, the MAC is only effective against gram-negative bacteria; it cannot penetrate the thick layer
of peptidoglycan associated with cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. Since the MAC does not pose a lethal threat to
gram-positive bacterial pathogens, complement-mediated opsonization is more important for their clearance.

Cytokines
Cytokines are soluble proteins that act as communication signals between cells. In a nonspecific innate immune
response, various cytokines may be released to stimulate production of chemical mediators or other cell functions,
such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, inhibition of cell division, apoptosis, and chemotaxis.

When a cytokine binds to its target receptor, the effect can vary widely depending on the type of cytokine and the
type of cell or receptor to which it has bound. The function of a particular cytokine can be described as autocrine,
paracrine, or endocrine (Figure 17.10). In autocrine function, the same cell that releases the cytokine is the
recipient of the signal; in other words, autocrine function is a form of self-stimulation by a cell. In contrast,
paracrine function involves the release of cytokines from one cell to other nearby cells, stimulating some response
from the recipient cells. Last, endocrine function occurs when cells release cytokines into the bloodstream to be
carried to target cells much farther away.
672  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     FIGURE 17.10 Autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine actions describe which cells are targeted by cytokines and how far the cytokines must
     travel to bind to their intended target cells' receptors.

     Three important classes of cytokines are the interleukins, chemokines, and interferons. The interleukins were
     originally thought to be produced only by leukocytes (white blood cells) and to only stimulate leukocytes, thus the
     reasons for their name. Although interleukins are involved in modulating almost every function of the immune
     system, their role in the body is not restricted to immunity. Interleukins are also produced by and stimulate a variety
     of cells unrelated to immune defenses.
     The chemokines are chemotactic factors that recruit leukocytes to sites of infection, tissue damage, and
     inflammation. In contrast to more general chemotactic factors, like complement factor C5a, chemokines are very
     specific in the subsets of leukocytes they recruit.
     Interferons are a diverse group of immune signaling molecules and are especially important in our defense against
     viruses. Type I interferons (interferon- and interferon-) are produced and released by cells infected with virus.
     These interferons stimulate nearby cells to stop production of mRNA, destroy RNA already produced, and reduce
     protein synthesis. These cellular changes inhibit viral replication and production of mature virus, slowing the spread
     of the virus. Type I interferons also stimulate various immune cells involved in viral clearance to more aggressively
     attack virus-infected cells. Type II interferon (interferon-) is an important activator of immune cells (Figure 17.11).

FIGURE 17.11 Interferons are cytokines released by a cell infected with a virus. Interferon- and interferon- signal uninfected
neighboring cells to inhibit mRNA synthesis, destroy RNA, and reduce protein synthesis (top arrow). Interferon- and interferon- also
promote apoptosis in cells infected with the virus (middle arrow). Interferon- alerts neighboring immune cells to an attack (bottom arrow).
Although interferons do not cure the cell releasing them or other infected cells, which will soon die, their release may prevent additional
cells from becoming infected, thus stemming the infection.

Inflammation-Eliciting Mediators

Many of the chemical mediators discussed in this section contribute in some way to inflammation and fever, which
are nonspecific immune responses discussed in more detail in Inflammation and Fever. Cytokines stimulate the
production of acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein and mannose-binding lectin in the liver. These acute-
phase proteins act as opsonins, activating complement cascades through the lectin pathway.

Some cytokines also bind mast cells and basophils, inducing them to release histamine, a proinflammatory
compound. Histamine receptors are found on a variety of cells and mediate proinflammatory events, such as
bronchoconstriction (tightening of the airways) and smooth muscle contraction.

In addition to histamine, mast cells may release other chemical mediators, such as leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are
lipid-based proinflammatory mediators that are produced from the metabolism of arachidonic acid in the cell
membrane of leukocytes and tissue cells. Compared with the proinflammatory effects of histamine, those of
leukotrienes are more potent and longer lasting. Together, these chemical mediators can induce coughing, vomiting,
and diarrhea, which serve to expel pathogens from the body.

Certain cytokines also stimulate the production of prostaglandins, chemical mediators that promote the
inflammatory effects of kinins and histamines. Prostaglandins can also help to set the body temperature higher,
leading to fever, which promotes the activities of white blood cells and slightly inhibits the growth of pathogenic
microbes (see Inflammation and Fever).

Another inflammatory mediator, bradykinin, contributes to edema, which occurs when fluids and leukocytes leak
out of the bloodstream and into tissues. It binds to receptors on cells in the capillary walls, causing the capillaries to
dilate and become more permeable to fluids.

from the same stem cells found in bone marrow. The three major categories of formed elements are: red blood cells
(RBCs), also called erythrocytes; platelets, also called thrombocytes; and white blood cells (WBCs), also called
leukocytes.

Red blood cells are primarily responsible for carrying oxygen to tissues. Platelets are cellular fragments that
participate in blood clot formation and tissue repair. Several different types of WBCs participate in various
nonspecific mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity. In this section, we will focus primarily on the innate
mechanisms of various types of WBCs.

Hematopoiesis

All of the formed elements of blood are derived from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone
marrow. As the HSCs make copies of themselves in the bone marrow, individual cells receive different cues from the
body that control how they develop and mature. As a result, the HSCs differentiate into different types of blood cells
that, once mature, circulate in peripheral blood. This process of differentiation, called hematopoiesis, is shown in
676  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     more detail in Figure 17.12.

     In terms of sheer numbers, the vast majority of HSCs become erythrocytes. Much smaller numbers become
     leukocytes and platelets. Leukocytes can be further subdivided into granulocytes, which are characterized by
     numerous granules visible in the cytoplasm, and agranulocytes, which lack granules. Figure 17.13 provides an
     overview of the various types of formed elements, including their relative numbers, primary function, and lifespans.

         FIGURE 17.13 Formed elements of blood include erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and platelets.

Granulocytes

The various types of granulocytes can be distinguished from one another in a blood smear by the appearance of
their nuclei and the contents of their granules, which confer different traits, functions, and staining properties. The
neutrophils, also called polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), have a nucleus with three to five lobes and small,
numerous, lilac-colored granules. Each lobe of the nucleus is connected by a thin strand of material to the other
678  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     lobes. The eosinophils have fewer lobes in the nucleus (typically 2-3) and larger granules that stain reddish-orange.
     The basophils have a two-lobed nucleus and large granules that stain dark blue or purple (Figure 17.14).

     FIGURE 17.14 Granulocytes can be distinguished by the number of lobes in their nuclei and the staining properties of their granules. (credit

     Neutrophils (PMNs)
     Neutrophils (PMNs) are frequently involved in the elimination and destruction of extracellular bacteria. They are
     capable of migrating through the walls of blood vessels to areas of bacterial infection and tissue damage, where
     they seek out and kill infectious bacteria. PMN granules contain a variety of defensins and hydrolytic enzymes that
     help them destroy bacteria through phagocytosis (described in more detail in Pathogen Recognition and
     Phagocytosis) In addition, when many neutrophils are brought into an infected area, they can be stimulated to
     release toxic molecules into the surrounding tissue to better clear infectious agents. This is called degranulation.

     Another mechanism used by neutrophils is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are extruded meshes of
     chromatin that are closely associated with antimicrobial granule proteins and components. Chromatin is DNA with
     associated proteins (usually histone proteins, around which DNA wraps for organization and packing within a cell).
     By creating and releasing a mesh or lattice-like structure of chromatin that is coupled with antimicrobial proteins,
     the neutrophils can mount a highly concentrated and efficient attack against nearby pathogens. Proteins frequently
     associated with NETs include lactoferrin, gelatinase, cathepsin G, and myeloperoxidase. Each has a different means
     of promoting antimicrobial activity, helping neutrophils eliminate pathogens. The toxic proteins in NETs may kill
     some of the body's own cells along with invading pathogens. However, this collateral damage can be repaired after
     the danger of the infection has been eliminated.

     As neutrophils fight an infection, a visible accumulation of leukocytes, cellular debris, and bacteria at the site of
     infection can be observed. This buildup is what we call pus (also known as purulent or suppurative discharge or
     drainage). The presence of pus is a sign that the immune defenses have been activated against an infection;
     historically, some physicians believed that inducing pus formation could actually promote the healing of wounds.
     The practice of promoting "laudable pus" (by, for instance, wrapping a wound in greasy wool soaked in wine) dates
     back to the ancient physician Galen in the 2nd century AD, and was practiced in variant forms until the 17th century
     (though it was not universally accepted). Today, this method is no longer practiced because we now know that it is
     not effective. Although a small amount of pus formation can indicate a strong immune response, artificially inducing
     pus formation does not promote recovery.

     Eosinophils
     Eosinophils are granulocytes that protect against protozoa and helminths; they also play a role in allergic reactions.

17.3 · Cellular Defenses                                                                                                                       679

The granules of eosinophils, which readily absorb the acidic reddish dye eosin, contain histamine, degradative
enzymes, and a compound known as major basic protein (MBP) (Figure 17.14). MBP binds to the surface
carbohydrates of parasites, and this binding is associated with disruption of the cell membrane and membrane
permeability.

Basophils
Basophils have cytoplasmic granules of varied size and are named for their granules' ability to absorb the basic dye
methylene blue (Figure 17.14). Their stimulation and degranulation can result from multiple triggering events.
Activated complement fragments C3a and C5a, produced in the activation cascades of complement proteins, act as
anaphylatoxins by inducing degranulation of basophils and inflammatory responses. This cell type is important in
allergic reactions and other responses that involve inflammation. One of the most abundant components of basophil
granules is histamine, which is released along with other chemical factors when the basophil is stimulated. These
chemicals can be chemotactic and can help to open the gaps between cells in the blood vessels. Other mechanisms
for basophil triggering require the assistance of antibodies, as discussed in B Lymphocytes and Humoral Immunity.

Mast Cells
Hematopoiesis also gives rise to mast cells, which appear to be derived from the same common myeloid progenitor
cell as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Functionally, mast cells are very similar to basophils, containing
many of the same components in their granules (e.g., histamine) and playing a similar role in allergic responses and
other inflammatory reactions. However, unlike basophils, mast cells leave the circulating blood and are most
frequently found residing in tissues. They are often associated with blood vessels and nerves or found close to
surfaces that interface with the external environment, such as the skin and mucous membranes in various regions of
the body (Figure 17.15).

FIGURE 17.15 Mast cells function similarly to basophils by inducing and promoting inflammatory responses. (a) This figure shows mast
cells in blood. In a blood smear, they are difficult to differentiate from basophils (b). Unlike basophils, mast cells migrate from the blood
into various tissues. (credit right: modification of work by Greenland JR, Xu X, Sayah DM, Liu FC, Jones KD, Looney MR, Caughey GH)

     Agranulocytes

     As their name suggests, agranulocytes lack visible granules in the cytoplasm. Agranulocytes can be categorized as
     lymphocytes or monocytes (Figure 17.13). Among the lymphocytes are natural killer cells, which play an important
     role in nonspecific innate immune defenses. Lymphocytes also include the B cells and T cells, which are discussed
     in the next chapter because they are central players in the specific adaptive immune defenses. The monocytes
     differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, which are collectively referred to as the mononuclear phagocyte
     system.

     Natural Killer Cells
     Most lymphocytes are primarily involved in the specific adaptive immune response, and thus will be discussed in the
     following chapter. An exception is the natural killer cells (NK cells); these mononuclear lymphocytes use
     nonspecific mechanisms to recognize and destroy cells that are abnormal in some way. Cancer cells and cells
     infected with viruses are two examples of cellular abnormalities that are targeted by NK cells. Recognition of such
     cells involves a complex process of identifying inhibitory and activating molecular markers on the surface of the
     target cell. Molecular markers that make up the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are expressed by healthy
     cells as an indication of "self." This will be covered in more detail in next chapter. NK cells are able to recognize
     normal MHC markers on the surface of healthy cells, and these MHC markers serve as an inhibitory signal preventing
     NK cell activation. However, cancer cells and virus-infected cells actively diminish or eliminate expression of MHC
     markers on their surface. When these MHC markers are diminished or absent, the NK cell interprets this as an
     abnormality and a cell in distress. This is one part of the NK cell activation process (Figure 17.16). NK cells are also
     activated by binding to activating molecular molecules on the target cell. These activating molecular molecules
     include "altered self" or "nonself" molecules. When a NK cell recognizes a decrease in inhibitory normal MHC
     molecules and an increase in activating molecules on the surface of a cell, the NK cell will be activated to eliminate
     the cell in distress.

FIGURE 17.16 Natural killer (NK) cells are inhibited by the presence of the major histocompatibility cell (MHC) receptor on healthy cells.
Cancer cells and virus-infected cells have reduced expression of MHC and increased expression of activating molecules. When a NK cell
recognizes decreased MHC and increased activating molecules, it will kill the abnormal cell.

Once a cell has been recognized as a target, the NK cell can use several different mechanisms to kill its target. For
example, it may express cytotoxic membrane proteins and cytokines that stimulate the target cell to undergo
apoptosis, or controlled cell suicide. NK cells may also use perforin-mediated cytotoxicity to induce apoptosis in
target cells. This mechanism relies on two toxins released from granules in the cytoplasm of the NK cell: perforin, a
protein that creates pores in the target cell, and granzymes, proteases that enter through the pores into the target
cell's cytoplasm, where they trigger a cascade of protein activation that leads to apoptosis. The NK cell binds to the
abnormal target cell, releases its destructive payload, and detaches from the target cell. While the target cell
undergoes apoptosis, the NK cell synthesizes more perforin and proteases to use on its next target.

NK cells contain these toxic compounds in granules in their cytoplasm. When stained, the granules are azurophilic
and can be visualized under a light microscope (Figure 17.17). Even though they have granules, NK cells are not
considered granulocytes because their granules are far less numerous than those found in true granulocytes.
Furthermore, NK cells have a different lineage than granulocytes, arising from lymphoid rather than myeloid stem
cells (Figure 17.12).

     Monocytes
     The largest of the white blood cells, monocytes have a nucleus that lacks lobes, and they also lack granules in the
     cytoplasm (Figure 17.18). Nevertheless, they are effective phagocytes, engulfing pathogens and apoptotic cells to
     help fight infection.
     When monocytes leave the bloodstream and enter a specific body tissue, they differentiate into tissue-specific
     phagocytes called macrophages and dendritic cells. They are particularly important residents of lymphoid tissue,
     as well as nonlymphoid sites and organs. Macrophages and dendritic cells can reside in body tissues for significant
     lengths of time. Macrophages in specific body tissues develop characteristics suited to the particular tissue. Not only
     do they provide immune protection for the tissue in which they reside but they also support normal function of their
     neighboring tissue cells through the production of cytokines. Macrophages are given tissue-specific names, and a
     few examples of tissue-specific macrophages are listed in Table 17.6. Dendritic cells are important sentinels
     residing in the skin and mucous membranes, which are portals of entry for many pathogens. Monocytes,
     macrophages, and dendritic cells are all highly phagocytic and important promoters of the immune response
     through their production and release of cytokines. These cells provide an essential bridge between innate and
     adaptive immune responses, as discussed in the next section as well as the next chapter.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how leukocytes migrate from peripheral blood into infected tissues
    · Explain the mechanisms by which leukocytes recognize pathogens
    · Explain the process of phagocytosis and the mechanisms by which phagocytes destroy and degrade

        pathogens

Several of the cell types discussed in the previous section can be described as phagocytes--cells whose main
function is to seek, ingest, and kill pathogens. This process, called phagocytosis, was first observed in starfish in the
1880s by Nobel Prize-winning zoologist Ilya Metchnikoff (1845-1916), who made the connection to white blood
cells (WBCs) in humans and other animals. At the time, Pasteur and other scientists believed that WBCs were
spreading pathogens rather than killing them (which is true for some diseases, such as tuberculosis). But in most
cases, phagocytes provide a strong, swift, and effective defense against a broad range of microbes, making them a
critical component of innate nonspecific immunity. This section will focus on the mechanisms by which phagocytes
are able to seek, recognize, and destroy pathogens.

Extravasation (Diapedesis) of Leukocytes

Some phagocytes are leukocytes (WBCs) that normally circulate in the bloodstream. To reach pathogens located in
infected tissue, leukocytes must pass through the walls of small capillary blood vessels within tissues. This process,
called extravasation, or diapedesis, is initiated by complement factor C5a, as well as cytokines released into the
immediate vicinity by resident macrophages and tissue cells responding to the presence of the infectious agent
(Figure 17.19). Similar to C5a, many of these cytokines are proinflammatory and chemotactic, and they bind to cells
of small capillary blood vessels, initiating a response in the endothelial cells lining the inside of the blood vessel
walls. This response involves the upregulation and expression of various cellular adhesion molecules and receptors.
Leukocytes passing through will stick slightly to the adhesion molecules, slowing down and rolling along the blood
vessel walls near the infected area. When they reach a cellular junction, they will bind to even more of these
adhesion molecules, flattening out and squeezing through the cellular junction in a process known as
transendothelial migration. This mechanism of "rolling adhesion" allows leukocytes to exit the bloodstream and
enter the infected areas, where they can begin phagocytosing the invading pathogens.

Note that extravasation does not occur in arteries or veins. These blood vessels are surrounded by thicker,
multilayer protective walls, in contrast to the thin single-cell-layer walls of capillaries. Furthermore, the blood flow
in arteries is too turbulent to allow for rolling adhesion. Also, some leukocytes tend to respond to an infection more
684  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     quickly than others. The first to arrive typically are neutrophils, often within hours of a bacterial infection. By
     contract, monocytes may take several days to leave the bloodstream and differentiate into macrophages.

     FIGURE 17.19 Damaged cells and macrophages that have ingested pathogens release cytokines that are proinflammatory and chemotactic
     for leukocytes. In addition, activation of complement at the site of infection results in production of the chemotactic and proinflammatory
     C5a. Leukocytes exit the blood vessel and follow the chemoattractant signal of cytokines and C5a to the site of infection. Granulocytes such
     as neutrophils release chemicals that destroy pathogens. They are also capable of phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacterial
     pathogens.

Pathogen Recognition

As described in the previous section, opsonization of pathogens by antibody; complement factors C1q, C3b, and
C4b; and lectins can assist phagocytic cells in recognition of pathogens and attachment to initiate phagocytosis.
However, not all pathogen recognition is opsonin dependent. Phagocytes can also recognize molecular structures
that are common to many groups of pathogenic microbes. Such structures are called pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs). Common PAMPs include the following:

    · peptidoglycan, found in bacterial cell walls;
    · flagellin, a protein found in bacterial flagella;
    · lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria;
    · lipopeptides, molecules expressed by most bacteria; and
    · nucleic acids such as viral DNA or RNA.

Like numerous other PAMPs, these substances are integral to the structure of broad classes of microbes.

The structures that allow phagocytic cells to detect PAMPs are called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). One
group of PRRs is the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which bind to various PAMPs and communicate with the nucleus of
the phagocyte to elicit a response. Many TLRs (and other PRRs) are located on the surface of a phagocyte, but some
can also be found embedded in the membranes of interior compartments and organelles (Figure 17.20). These
interior PRRs can be useful for the binding and recognition of intracellular pathogens that may have gained access to
the inside of the cell before phagocytosis could take place. Viral nucleic acids, for example, might encounter an
interior PRR, triggering production of the antiviral cytokine interferon.

In addition to providing the first step of pathogen recognition, the interaction between PAMPs and PRRs on
macrophages provides an intracellular signal that activates the phagocyte, causing it to transition from a dormant
state of readiness and slow proliferation to a state of hyperactivity, proliferation, production/secretion of cytokines,
and enhanced intracellular killing. PRRs on macrophages also respond to chemical distress signals from damaged or
stressed cells. This allows macrophages to extend their responses beyond protection from infectious diseases to a
broader role in the inflammatory response initiated from injuries or other diseases.

     a signal to the nucleus that activates genes involved in phagocytosis, cellular proliferation, production and secretion of antiviral interferons
     and proinflammatory cytokines, and enhanced intracellular killing.

         · Describe the process of phagocyte activation.

     Pathogen Degradation

     Once pathogen recognition and attachment occurs, the pathogen is engulfed in a vesicle and brought into the
     internal compartment of the phagocyte in a process called phagocytosis (Figure 17.21). PRRs can aid in
     phagocytosis by first binding to the pathogen's surface, but phagocytes are also capable of engulfing nearby items
     even if they are not bound to specific receptors. To engulf the pathogen, the phagocyte forms a pseudopod that
     wraps around the pathogen and then pinches it off into a membrane vesicle called a phagosome. Acidification of the
     phagosome (pH decreases to the range of 4-5) provides an important early antibacterial mechanism. The
     phagosome containing the pathogen fuses with one or more lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome. Formation of the
     phagolysosome enhances the acidification, which is essential for activation of pH-dependent digestive lysosomal
     enzymes and production of hydrogen peroxide and toxic reactive oxygen species. Lysosomal enzymes such as
     lysozyme, phospholipase, and proteases digest the pathogen. Other enzymes are involved in a respiratory burst.
     During the respiratory burst, phagocytes will increase their uptake and consumption of oxygen, but not for energy
     production. The increased oxygen consumption is focused on the production of superoxide anion, hydrogen
     peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and other reactive oxygen species that are antibacterial.

     In addition to the reactive oxygen species produced by the respiratory burst, reactive nitrogen compounds with
     cytotoxic (cell-killing) potential can also form. For example, nitric oxide can react with superoxide to form
     peroxynitrite, a highly reactive nitrogen compound with degrading capabilities similar to those of the reactive oxygen
     species. Some phagocytes even contain an internal storehouse of microbicidal defensin proteins (e.g., neutrophil
     granules). These destructive forces can be released into the area around the cell to degrade microbes externally.
     Neutrophils, especially, can be quite efficient at this secondary antimicrobial mechanism.

     Once degradation is complete, leftover waste products are excreted from the cell in an exocytic vesicle. However, it

is important to note that not all remains of the pathogen are excreted as waste. Macrophages and dendritic cells are
also antigen-presenting cells involved in the specific adaptive immune response. These cells further process the
remains of the degraded pathogen and present key antigens (specific pathogen proteins) on their cellular surface.
This is an important step for stimulation of some adaptive immune responses, as will be discussed in more detail in
the next chapter.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

When Phagocytosis Fails

Although phagocytosis successfully destroys many pathogens, some are able to survive and even exploit this
defense mechanism to multiply in the body and cause widespread infection. Protozoans of the genus Leishmania
are one example. These obligate intracellular parasites are flagellates transmitted to humans by the bite of a sand
fly. Infections cause serious and sometimes disfiguring sores and ulcers in the skin and other tissues (Figure 17.22).
Worldwide, an estimated 1.3 million people are newly infected with leishmaniasis annually.1
Salivary peptides from the sand fly activate host macrophages at the site of their bite. The classic or alternate
pathway for complement activation ensues with C3b opsonization of the parasite. Leishmania cells are
phagocytosed, lose their flagella, and multiply in a form known as an amastigote (Leishman-Donovan body) within
the phagolysosome. Although many other pathogens are destroyed in the phagolysosome, survival of the
Leishmania amastigotes is maintained by the presence of surface lipophosphoglycan and acid phosphatase. These
substances inhibit the macrophage respiratory burst and lysosomal enzymes. The parasite then multiplies inside the
cell and lyses the infected macrophage, releasing the amastigotes to infect other macrophages within the same
host. Should another sand fly bite an infected person, it might ingest amastigotes and then transmit them to another
individual through another bite.
There are several different forms of leishmaniasis. The most common is a localized cutaneous form of the illness
caused by L. tropica, which typically resolves spontaneously over time but with some significant lymphocyte
infiltration and permanent scarring. A mucocutaneous form of the disease, caused by L. viannia brasilienfsis,

688  17 · Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses

     produces lesions in the tissue of the nose and mouth and can be life threatening. A visceral form of the illness can
     be caused by several of the different Leishmania species. It affects various organ systems and causes abnormal
     enlargement of the liver and spleen. Irregular fevers, anemia, liver dysfunction, and weight loss are all signs and
     symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis. If left untreated, it is typically fatal.

     17.5 Inflammation and Fever

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the signs of inflammation and fever and explain why they occur
         · Explain the advantages and risks posed by inflammatory responses

     The inflammatory response, or inflammation, is triggered by a cascade of chemical mediators and cellular
     responses that may occur when cells are damaged and stressed or when pathogens successfully breach the
     physical barriers of the innate immune system. Although inflammation is typically associated with negative
     consequences of injury or disease, it is a necessary process insofar as it allows for recruitment of the cellular
     defenses needed to eliminate pathogens, remove damaged and dead cells, and initiate repair mechanisms.
     Excessive inflammation, however, can result in local tissue damage and, in severe cases, may even become deadly.

     Acute Inflammation

     An early, if not immediate, response to tissue injury is acute inflammation. Immediately following an injury,
     vasoconstriction of blood vessels will occur to minimize blood loss. The amount of vasoconstriction is related to the
     amount of vascular injury, but it is usually brief. Vasoconstriction is followed by vasodilation and increased vascular
     permeability, as a direct result of the release of histamine from resident mast cells. Increased blood flow and
     vascular permeability can dilute toxins and bacterial products at the site of injury or infection. They also contribute
     to the five observable signs associated with the inflammatory response: erythema (redness), edema (swelling),
     heat, pain, and altered function. Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability are also associated with an influx
     of phagocytes at the site of injury and/or infection. This can enhance the inflammatory response because
     phagocytes may release proinflammatory chemicals when they are activated by cellular distress signals released
     from damaged cells, by PAMPs, or by opsonins on the surface of pathogens. Activation of the complement system
     can further enhance the inflammatory response through the production of the anaphylatoxin C5a. Figure 17.23
     illustrates a typical case of acute inflammation at the site of a skin wound.

FIGURE 17.23 (a) Mast cells detect injury to nearby cells and release histamine, initiating an inflammatory response. (b) Histamine
increases blood flow to the wound site, and increased vascular permeability allows fluid, proteins, phagocytes, and other immune cells to
enter infected tissue. These events result in the swelling and reddening of the injured site, and the increased blood flow to the injured site
causes it to feel warm. Inflammation is also associated with pain due to these events stimulating nerve pain receptors in the tissue. The
interaction of phagocyte PRRs with cellular distress signals and PAMPs and opsonins on the surface of pathogens leads to the release of
more proinflammatory chemicals, enhancing the inflammatory response.

During the period of inflammation, the release of bradykinin causes capillaries to remain dilated, flooding tissues
with fluids and leading to edema. Increasing numbers of neutrophils are recruited to the area to fight pathogens. As
the fight rages on, pus forms from the accumulation of neutrophils, dead cells, tissue fluids, and lymph. Typically,
after a few days, macrophages will help to clear out this pus. Eventually, tissue repair can begin in the wounded
area.

Chronic Inflammation

When acute inflammation is unable to clear an infectious pathogen, chronic inflammation may occur. This often
results in an ongoing (and sometimes futile) lower-level battle between the host organism and the pathogen. The
wounded area may heal at a superficial level, but pathogens may still be present in deeper tissues, stimulating
ongoing inflammation. Additionally, chronic inflammation may be involved in the progression of degenerative
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, heart disease, and metastatic cancer.
Chronic inflammation may lead to the formation of granulomas, pockets of infected tissue walled off and
surrounded by WBCs. Macrophages and other phagocytes wage an unsuccessful battle to eliminate the pathogens
and dead cellular materials within a granuloma. One example of a disease that produces chronic inflammation is
tuberculosis, which results in the formation of granulomas in lung tissues. A tubercular granuloma is called a
tubercle (Figure 17.24). Tuberculosis will be covered in more detail in Bacterial Infections of the Respiratory Tract.
Chronic inflammation is not just associated with bacterial infections. Chronic inflammation can be an important
cause of tissue damage from viral infections. The extensive scarring observed with hepatitis C infections and liver
cirrhosis is the result of chronic inflammation.

     Chronic Edema

     In addition to granulomas, chronic inflammation can also result in long-term edema. A condition known as
     lymphatic filariasis (also known as elephantiasis) provides an extreme example. Lymphatic filariasis is caused by
     microscopic nematodes (parasitic worms) whose larvae are transmitted between human hosts by mosquitoes. Adult
     worms live in the lymphatic vessels, where their presence stimulates infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells,
     eosinophils, and thrombocytes (a condition known as lymphangitis). Because of the chronic nature of the illness,
     granulomas, fibrosis, and blocking of the lymphatic system may eventually occur. Over time, these blockages may
     worsen with repeated infections over decades, leading to skin thickened with edema and fibrosis. Lymph
     (extracellular tissue fluid) may spill out of the lymphatic areas and back into tissues, causing extreme swelling
     (Figure 17.25). Secondary bacterial infections commonly follow. Because it is a disease caused by a parasite,
     eosinophilia (a dramatic rise in the number of eosinophils in the blood) is characteristic of acute infection. However,
     this increase in antiparasite granulocytes is not sufficient to clear the infection in many cases.

     Lymphatic filariasis affects an estimated 120 million people worldwide, mostly concentrated in Africa and Asia.2
     Improved sanitation and mosquito control can reduce transmission rates.

     Prevention)

     Fever

     A fever is an inflammatory response that extends beyond the site of infection and affects the entire body, resulting
     in an overall increase in body temperature. Body temperature is normally regulated and maintained by the
     hypothalamus, an anatomical section of the brain that functions to maintain homeostasis in the body. However,

certain bacterial or viral infections can result in the production of pyrogens, chemicals that effectively alter the
"thermostat setting" of the hypothalamus to elevate body temperature and cause fever. Pyrogens may be
exogenous or endogenous. For example, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), produced by gram-negative
bacteria, is an exogenous pyrogen that may induce the leukocytes to release endogenous pyrogens such as
interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, interferon- (IFN-), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In a cascading effect, these
molecules can then lead to the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from other cells, resetting the hypothalamus to
initiate fever (Figure 17.26).

FIGURE 17.26 The role of the hypothalamus in the inflammatory response. Macrophages recognize pathogens in an area and release
cytokines that trigger inflammation. The cytokines also send a signal up the vagus nerve to the hypothalamus.

Like other forms of inflammation, a fever enhances the innate immune defenses by stimulating leukocytes to kill
pathogens. The rise in body temperature also may inhibit the growth of many pathogens since human pathogens are
mesophiles with optimum growth occurring around 35 °C (95 °F). In addition, some studies suggest that fever may
also stimulate release of iron-sequestering compounds from the liver, thereby starving out microbes that rely on iron
for growth.3

During fever, the skin may appear pale due to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels in the skin, which is mediated by
the hypothalamus to divert blood flow away from extremities, minimizing the loss of heat and raising the core
temperature. The hypothalamus will also stimulate shivering of muscles, another effective mechanism of generating
heat and raising the core temperature.

The crisis phase occurs when the fever breaks. The hypothalamus stimulates vasodilation, resulting in a return of
blood flow to the skin and a subsequent release of heat from the body. The hypothalamus also stimulates sweating,
which cools the skin as the sweat evaporates.

Although a low-level fever may help an individual overcome an illness, in some instances, this immune response can
be too strong, causing tissue and organ damage and, in severe cases, even death. The inflammatory response to
bacterial superantigens is one scenario in which a life-threatening fever may develop. Superantigens are bacterial or
viral proteins that can cause an excessive activation of T cells from the specific adaptive immune defense, as well as
an excessive release of cytokines that overstimulates the inflammatory response. For example, Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are capable of producing superantigens that cause toxic shock syndrome and
scarlet fever, respectively. Both of these conditions can be associated with very high, life-threatening fevers in
excess of 42 °C (108 °F).

     CLINICAL FOCUS

     Resolution

     Given her father's premature death, Angela's doctor suspects that she has hereditary angioedema, a genetic
     disorder that compromises the function of C1 inhibitor protein. Patients with this genetic abnormality may have
     occasional episodes of swelling in various parts of the body. In Angela's case, the swelling has occurred in the
     respiratory tract, leading to difficulty breathing. Swelling may also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, causing
     abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting, or in the muscles of the face or limbs. This swelling may be
     nonresponsive to steroid treatment and is often misdiagnosed as an allergy.

     Because there are three types of hereditary angioedema, the doctor orders a more specific blood test to look for
     levels of C1-INH, as well as a functional assay of Angela's C1 inhibitors. The results suggest that Angela has type
     I hereditary angioedema, which accounts for 80%-85% of all cases. This form of the disorder is caused by a
     deficiency in C1 esterase inhibitors, the proteins that normally help suppress activation of the complement
     system. When these proteins are deficient or nonfunctional, overstimulation of the system can lead to
     production of inflammatory anaphylatoxins, which results in swelling and fluid buildup in tissues.

     There is no cure for hereditary angioedema, but timely treatment with purified and concentrated C1-INH from
     blood donors can be effective, preventing tragic outcomes like the one suffered by Angela's father. A number of
     therapeutic drugs, either currently approved or in late-stage human trials, may also be considered as options for
     treatment in the near future. These drugs work by inhibiting inflammatory molecules or the receptors for
     inflammatory molecules.

     Thankfully, Angela's condition was quickly diagnosed and treated. Although she may experience additional
     episodes in the future, her prognosis is good and she can expect to live a relatively normal life provided she
     seeks treatment at the onset of symptoms.

INTRODUCTION People living in developed nations and born in the 1960s or later may have difficulty
understanding the once heavy burden of devastating infectious diseases. For example, smallpox, a deadly viral
disease, once destroyed entire civilizations but has since been eradicated. Thanks to the vaccination efforts by
multiple groups, including the World Health Organization, Rotary International, and the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), smallpox has not been diagnosed in a patient since 1977. Polio is another excellent example. This
crippling viral disease paralyzed patients, who were often kept alive in "iron lung wards" as recently as the 1950s
(Figure 18.1). Today, vaccination against polio has nearly eradicated the disease. Vaccines have also reduced the
prevalence of once-common infectious diseases such as chickenpox, German measles, measles, mumps, and
whooping cough. The success of these and other vaccines is due to the very specific and adaptive host defenses that
are the focus of this chapter.
Innate Nonspecific Host Defenses described innate immunity against microbial pathogens. Higher animals, such as
humans, also possess an adaptive immune defense, which is highly specific for individual microbial pathogens. This
specific adaptive immunity is acquired through active infection or vaccination and serves as an important defense
against pathogens that evade the defenses of innate immunity.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Olivia, a one-year old infant, is brought to the emergency room by her parents, who report her symptoms:
       excessive crying, irritability, sensitivity to light, unusual lethargy, and vomiting. A physician feels swollen lymph
       nodes in Olivia's throat and armpits. In addition, the area of the abdomen over the spleen is swollen and tender.

           · What do these symptoms suggest?

       Jump to the next Clinical Focus box.

     Adaptive immunity is defined by two important characteristics: specificity and memory. Specificity refers to the
     adaptive immune system's ability to target specific pathogens, and memory refers to its ability to quickly respond to
     pathogens to which it has previously been exposed. For example, when an individual recovers from chickenpox, the
     body develops a memory of the infection that will specifically protect it from the causative agent, the varicella-
     zoster virus, if it is exposed to the virus again later.

     Specificity and memory are achieved by essentially programming certain cells involved in the immune response to
     respond rapidly to subsequent exposures of the pathogen. This programming occurs as a result of the first exposure
     to a pathogen or vaccine, which triggers a primary response. Subsequent exposures result in a secondary
     response that is faster and stronger as a result of the body's memory of the first exposure (Figure 18.2). This
     secondary response, however, is specific to the pathogen in question. For example, exposure to one virus (e.g.,
     varicella-zoster virus) will not provide protection against other viral diseases (e.g., measles, mumps, or polio).

     Adaptive specific immunity involves the actions of two distinct cell types: B lymphocytes (B cells) and T
     lymphocytes (T cells). Although B cells and T cells arise from a common hematopoietic stem cell differentiation
     pathway (see Figure 17.12), their sites of maturation and their roles in adaptive immunity are very different.

     B cells mature in the bone marrow and are responsible for the production of glycoproteins called antibodies, or
     immunoglobulins. Antibodies are involved in the body's defense against pathogens and toxins in the extracellular
     environment. Mechanisms of adaptive specific immunity that involve B cells and antibody production are referred to
     as humoral immunity. The maturation of T cells occurs in the thymus. T cells function as the central orchestrator of
     both innate and adaptive immune responses. They are also responsible for destruction of cells infected with
     intracellular pathogens. The targeting and destruction of intracellular pathogens by T cells is called cell-mediated
     immunity, or cellular immunity.

    · How do humoral and cellular immunity differ?

Antigens

Activation of the adaptive immune defenses is triggered by pathogen-specific molecular structures called antigens.
Antigens are similar to the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) discussed in Pathogen Recognition and
Phagocytosis; however, whereas PAMPs are molecular structures found on numerous pathogens, antigens are
unique to a specific pathogen. The antigens that stimulate adaptive immunity to chickenpox, for example, are
unique to the varicella-zoster virus but significantly different from the antigens associated with other viral
pathogens.

The term antigen was initially used to describe molecules that stimulate the production of antibodies; in fact, the
term comes from a combination of the words antibody and generator, and a molecule that stimulates antibody
production is said to be antigenic. However, the role of antigens is not limited to humoral immunity and the
production of antibodies; antigens also play an essential role in stimulating cellular immunity, and for this reason
antigens are sometimes more accurately referred to as immunogens. In this text, however, we will typically refer to
them as antigens.

Pathogens possess a variety of structures that may contain antigens. For example, antigens from bacterial cells may
be associated with their capsules, cell walls, fimbriae, flagella, or pili. Bacterial antigens may also be associated with
extracellular toxins and enzymes that they secrete. Viruses possess a variety of antigens associated with their
capsids, envelopes, and the spike structures they use for attachment to cells.

Antigens may belong to any number of molecular classes, including carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, proteins,
and combinations of these molecules. Antigens of different classes vary in their ability to stimulate adaptive immune
defenses as well as in the type of response they stimulate (humoral or cellular). The structural complexity of an
antigenic molecule is an important factor in its antigenic potential. In general, more complex molecules are more
effective as antigens. For example, the three-dimensional complex structure of proteins make them the most
effective and potent antigens, capable of stimulating both humoral and cellular immunity. In comparison,
carbohydrates are less complex in structure and therefore less effective as antigens; they can only stimulate
humoral immune defenses. Lipids and nucleic acids are the least antigenic molecules, and in some cases may only
become antigenic when combined with proteins or carbohydrates to form glycolipids, lipoproteins, or
nucleoproteins.

One reason the three-dimensional complexity of antigens is so important is that antibodies and T cells do not
702  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     recognize and interact with an entire antigen but with smaller exposed regions on the surface of antigens called
     epitopes. A single antigen may possess several different epitopes (Figure 18.3), and different antibodies may bind
     to different epitopes on the same antigen (Figure 18.4). For example, the bacterial flagellum is a large, complex
     protein structure that can possess hundreds or even thousands of epitopes with unique three-dimensional
     structures. Moreover, flagella from different bacterial species (or even strains of the same species) contain unique
     epitopes that can only be bound by specific antibodies.

     An antigen's size is another important factor in its antigenic potential. Whereas large antigenic structures like
     flagella possess multiple epitopes, some molecules are too small to be antigenic by themselves. Such molecules,
     called haptens, are essentially free epitopes that are not part of the complex three-dimensional structure of a larger
     antigen. For a hapten to become antigenic, it must first attach to a larger carrier molecule (usually a protein) to
     produce a conjugate antigen. The hapten-specific antibodies produced in response to the conjugate antigen are then

     pathogens, but they are responsible for some allergic responses. For example, the hapten urushiol, a molecule
     found in the oil of plants that cause poison ivy, causes an immune response that can result in a severe rash (called
     contact dermatitis). Similarly, the hapten penicillin can cause allergic reactions to drugs in the penicillin class.

Antibodies

Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are glycoproteins that are present in both the blood and tissue fluids. The
basic structure of an antibody monomer consists of four protein chains held together by disulfide bonds (Figure
18.5). A disulfide bond is a covalent bond between the sulfhydryl R groups found on two cysteine amino acids. The
two largest chains are identical to each other and are called the heavy chains. The two smaller chains are also
identical to each other and are called the light chains. Joined together, the heavy and light chains form a basic Y-
shaped structure.

The two `arms' of the Y-shaped antibody molecule are known as the Fab region, for "fragment of antigen binding."
The far end of the Fab region is the variable region, which serves as the site of antigen binding. The amino acid
sequence in the variable region dictates the three-dimensional structure, and thus the specific three-dimensional
epitope to which the Fab region is capable of binding. Although the epitope specificity of the Fab regions is identical
for each arm of a single antibody molecule, this region displays a high degree of variability between antibodies with
different epitope specificities. Binding to the Fab region is necessary for neutralization of pathogens, agglutination or
aggregation of pathogens, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

The constant region of the antibody molecule includes the trunk of the Y and lower portion of each arm of the Y. The
trunk of the Y is also called the Fc region, for "fragment of crystallization," and is the site of complement factor
binding and binding to phagocytic cells during antibody-mediated opsonization.

Antibody Classes
The constant region of an antibody molecule determines its class, or isotype. The five classes of antibodies are IgG,
IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. Each class possesses unique heavy chains designated by Greek letters , , , , and ,
respectively. Antibody classes also exhibit important differences in abundance in serum, arrangement, body sites of
action, functional roles, and size (Figure 18.6).
IgG is a monomer that is by far the most abundant antibody in human blood, accounting for about 80% of total
704  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     serum antibody. IgG penetrates efficiently into tissue spaces, and is the only antibody class with the ability to cross
     the placental barrier, providing passive immunity to the developing fetus during pregnancy. IgG is also the most
     versatile antibody class in terms of its role in the body's defense against pathogens.

     IgM is initially produced in a monomeric membrane-bound form that serves as an antigen-binding receptor on B
     cells. The secreted form of IgM assembles into a pentamer with five monomers of IgM bound together by a protein
     structure called the J chain. Although the location of the J chain relative to the Fc regions of the five monomers
     prevents IgM from performing some of the functions of IgG, the ten available Fab sites associated with a pentameric
     IgM make it an important antibody in the body's arsenal of defenses. IgM is the first antibody produced and
     secreted by B cells during the primary and secondary immune responses, making pathogen-specific IgM a valuable
     diagnostic marker during active or recent infections.

     IgA accounts for about 13% of total serum antibody, and secretory IgA is the most common and abundant antibody
     class found in the mucus secretions that protect the mucous membranes. IgA can also be found in other secretions
     such as breast milk, tears, and saliva. Secretory IgA is assembled into a dimeric form with two monomers joined by
     a protein structure called the secretory component. One of the important functions of secretory IgA is to trap
     pathogens in mucus so that they can later be eliminated from the body.

     Similar to IgM, IgD is a membrane-bound monomer found on the surface of B cells, where it serves as an antigen-
     binding receptor. However, IgD is not secreted by B cells, and only trace amounts are detected in serum. These trace
     amounts most likely come from the degradation of old B cells and the release of IgD molecules from their
     cytoplasmic membranes.

     IgE is the least abundant antibody class in serum. Like IgG, it is secreted as a monomer, but its role in adaptive
     immunity is restricted to anti-parasitic defenses. The Fc region of IgE binds to basophils and mast cells. The Fab
     region of the bound IgE then interacts with specific antigen epitopes, causing the cells to release potent pro-
     inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory reaction resulting from the activation of mast cells and basophils aids in
     the defense against parasites, but this reaction is also central to allergic reactions (see Diseases of the Immune
     System.

Antigen-Antibody Interactions

Different classes of antibody play important roles in the body's defense against pathogens. These functions include
neutralization of pathogens, opsonization for phagocytosis, agglutination, complement activation, and antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. For most of these functions, antibodies also provide an important link
between adaptive specific immunity and innate nonspecific immunity.

Neutralization involves the binding of certain antibodies (IgG, IgM, or IgA) to epitopes on the surface of pathogens
or toxins, preventing their attachment to cells. For example, Secretory IgA can bind to specific pathogens and block
initial attachment to intestinal mucosal cells. Similarly, specific antibodies can bind to certain toxins, blocking them
from attaching to target cells and thus neutralizing their toxic effects. Viruses can be neutralized and prevented from
infecting a cell by the same mechanism (Figure 18.7).

As described in Chemical Defenses, opsonization is the coating of a pathogen with molecules, such as complement
706  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     factors, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A, to assist in phagocyte binding to facilitate phagocytosis. IgG
     antibodies also serve as excellent opsonins, binding their Fab sites to specific epitopes on the surface of pathogens.
     Phagocytic cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils have receptors on their surfaces that
     recognize and bind to the Fc portion of the IgG molecules; thus, IgG helps such phagocytes attach to and engulf the
     pathogens they have bound (Figure 18.8).

     Agglutination or aggregation involves the cross-linking of pathogens by antibodies to create large aggregates
     (Figure 18.9). IgG has two Fab antigen-binding sites, which can bind to two separate pathogen cells, clumping them
     together. When multiple IgG antibodies are involved, large aggregates can develop; these aggregates are easier for
     the kidneys and spleen to filter from the blood and easier for phagocytes to ingest for destruction. The pentameric
     structure of IgM provides ten Fab binding sites per molecule, making it the most efficient antibody for agglutination.

     FIGURE 18.7 Neutralization involves the binding of specific antibodies to antigens found on bacteria, viruses, and toxins, preventing them
     from attaching to target cells.

     FIGURE 18.8 Antibodies serve as opsonins and inhibit infection by tagging pathogens for destruction by macrophages, dendritic cells, and
     neutrophils. These phagocytic cells use Fc receptors to bind to IgG-opsonized pathogens and initiate the first step of attachment before
     phagocytosis.

FIGURE 18.9 Antibodies, especially IgM antibodies, agglutinate bacteria by binding to epitopes on two or more bacteria simultaneously.
When multiple pathogens and antibodies are present, aggregates form when the binding sites of antibodies bind with separate pathogens.

Another important function of antibodies is activation of the complement cascade. As discussed in the previous
chapter, the complement system is an important component of the innate defenses, promoting the inflammatory
response, recruiting phagocytes to site of infection, enhancing phagocytosis by opsonization, and killing gram-
negative bacterial pathogens with the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation can occur through
three different pathways (see Figure 17.9), but the most efficient is the classical pathway, which requires the initial
binding of IgG or IgM antibodies to the surface of a pathogen cell, allowing for recruitment and activation of the C1
complex.
Yet another important function of antibodies is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which
enhances killing of pathogens that are too large to be phagocytosed. This process is best characterized for natural
killer cells (NK cells), as shown in Figure 18.10, but it can also involve macrophages and eosinophils. ADCC occurs
when the Fab region of an IgG antibody binds to a large pathogen; Fc receptors on effector cells (e.g., NK cells) then
bind to the Fc region of the antibody, bringing them into close proximity with the target pathogen. The effector cell
then secretes powerful cytotoxins (e.g., perforin and granzymes) that kill the pathogen.

FIGURE 18.10 In this example of ADCC, antibodies bind to a large pathogenic cell that is too big for phagocytosis and then bind to Fc
receptors on the membrane of a natural killer cell. This interaction brings the NK cell into close proximity, where it can kill the pathogen
through release of lethal extracellular cytotoxins.

     18.2 Major Histocompatibility Complexes and Antigen-Presenting Cells

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify cells that express MHC I and/or MHC II molecules and describe the structures and cellular
             location of MHC I and MHC II molecules

         · Identify the cells that are antigen-presenting cells
         · Describe the process of antigen processing and presentation with MHC I and MHC II

     As discussed in Cellular Defenses, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are expressed on the surface
     of healthy cells, identifying them as normal and "self" to natural killer (NK) cells. MHC molecules also play an
     important role in the presentation of foreign antigens, which is a critical step in the activation of T cells and thus an
     important mechanism of the adaptive immune system.

     Major Histocompatibility Complex Molecules

     The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a collection of genes coding for MHC molecules found on the
     surface of all nucleated cells of the body. In humans, the MHC genes are also referred to as human leukocyte
     antigen (HLA) genes. Mature red blood cells, which lack a nucleus, are the only cells that do not express MHC
     molecules on their surface.

     There are two classes of MHC molecules involved in adaptive immunity, MHC I and MHC II (Figure 18.11). MHC I
     molecules are found on all nucleated cells; they present normal self-antigens as well as abnormal or nonself
     pathogens to the effector T cells involved in cellular immunity. In contrast, MHC II molecules are only found on
     macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells; they present abnormal or nonself pathogen antigens for the initial
     activation of T cells.

     Both types of MHC molecules are transmembrane glycoproteins that assemble as dimers in the cytoplasmic
     membrane of cells, but their structures are quite different. MHC I molecules are composed of a longer  protein
     chain coupled with a smaller 2 microglobulin protein, and only the  chain spans the cytoplasmic membrane. The 
     chain of the MHC I molecule folds into three separate domains: 1, 2 and 3. MHC II molecules are composed of
     two protein chains (an  and a  chain) that are approximately similar in length. Both chains of the MHC II molecule
     possess portions that span the plasma membrane, and each chain folds into two separate domains: 1 and 2, and
     1, and 2. In order to present abnormal or non-self-antigens to T cells, MHC molecules have a cleft that serves as
     the antigen-binding site near the "top" (or outermost) portion of the MHC-I or MHC-II dimer. For MHC I, the antigen-
     binding cleft is formed by the 1 and 2 domains, whereas for MHC II, the cleft is formed by the 1 and 1 domains
     (Figure 18.11).

Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)

All nucleated cells in the body have mechanisms for processing and presenting antigens in association with MHC
molecules. This signals the immune system, indicating whether the cell is normal and healthy or infected with an
intracellular pathogen. However, only macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells have the ability to present antigens
specifically for the purpose of activating T cells; for this reason, these types of cells are sometimes referred to as
antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

While all APCs play a similar role in adaptive immunity, there are some important differences to consider.
Macrophages and dendritic cells are phagocytes that ingest and kill pathogens that penetrate the first-line barriers
(i.e., skin and mucous membranes). B cells, on the other hand, do not function as phagocytes but play a primary role
in the production and secretion of antibodies. In addition, whereas macrophages and dendritic cells recognize
pathogens through nonspecific receptor interactions (e.g., PAMPs, toll-like receptors, and receptors for opsonizing
complement or antibody), B cells interact with foreign pathogens or their free antigens using antigen-specific
immunoglobulin as receptors (monomeric IgD and IgM). When the immunoglobulin receptors bind to an antigen, the
B cell internalizes the antigen by endocytosis before processing and presentting the antigen to T cells.

Antigen Presentation with MHC II Molecules
MHC II molecules are only found on the surface of APCs. Macrophages and dendritic cells use similar mechanisms
for processing and presentation of antigens and their epitopes in association with MHC II; B cells use somewhat
different mechanisms that will be described further in B Lymphocytes and Humoral Immunity. For now, we will
focus on the steps of the process as they pertain to dendritic cells.

After a dendritic cell recognizes and attaches to a pathogen cell, the pathogen is internalized by phagocytosis and is
initially contained within a phagosome. Lysosomes containing antimicrobial enzymes and chemicals fuse with the
phagosome to create a phagolysosome, where degradation of the pathogen for antigen processing begins.
Proteases (protein-degrading) are especially important in antigen processing because only protein antigen epitopes
are presented to T cells by MHC II (Figure 18.12).

APCs do not present all possible epitopes to T cells; only a selection of the most antigenic or immunodominant
epitopes are presented. The mechanism by which epitopes are selected for processing and presentation by an APC
is complicated and not well understood; however, once the most antigenic, immunodominant epitopes have been
processed, they associate within the antigen-binding cleft of MHC II molecules and are translocated to the cell
surface of the dendritic cell for presentation to T cells.

     most antigenic epitopes are selected and presented on the cell's surface in conjunction with MHC II molecules. T cells recognize the
     presented antigens and are thus activated.

         · What is the role of antigen presentation in adaptive immunity?

     Antigen Presentation with MHC I Molecules
     MHC I molecules, found on all normal, healthy, nucleated cells, signal to the immune system that the cell is a normal
     "self" cell. In a healthy cell, proteins normally found in the cytoplasm are degraded by proteasomes (enzyme
     complexes responsible for degradation and processing of proteins) and processed into self-antigen epitopes; these
     self-antigen epitopes bind within the MHC I antigen-binding cleft and are then presented on the cell surface.
     Immune cells, such as NK cells, recognize these self-antigens and do not target the cell for destruction. However, if
     a cell becomes infected with an intracellular pathogen (e.g., a virus), protein antigens specific to the pathogen are
     processed in the proteasomes and bind with MHC I molecules for presentation on the cell surface. This presentation
     of pathogen-specific antigens with MHC I signals that the infected cell must be targeted for destruction along with
     the pathogen.
     Before elimination of infected cells can begin, APCs must first activate the T cells involved in cellular immunity. If an
     intracellular pathogen directly infects the cytoplasm of an APC, then the processing and presentation of antigens
     can occur as described (in proteasomes and on the cell surface with MHC I). However, if the intracellular pathogen
     does not directly infect APCs, an alternative strategy called cross-presentation is utilized. In cross-presentation,
     antigens are brought into the APC by mechanisms normally leading to presentation with MHC II (i.e., through
     phagocytosis), but the antigen is presented on an MHC I molecule for CD8 T cells. The exact mechanisms by which
     cross-presentation occur are not yet well understood, but it appears that cross-presentation is primarily a function
     of dendritic cells and not macrophages or B cells.

As explained in Overview of Specific Adaptive Immunity, the antibodies involved in humoral immunity often bind
pathogens and toxins before they can attach to and invade host cells. Thus, humoral immunity is primarily
concerned with fighting pathogens in extracellular spaces. However, pathogens that have already gained entry to
host cells are largely protected from the humoral antibody-mediated defenses. Cellular immunity, on the other
hand, targets and eliminates intracellular pathogens through the actions of T lymphocytes, or T cells (Figure 18.13).
T cells also play a more central role in orchestrating the overall adaptive immune response (humoral as well as
cellular) along with the cellular defenses of innate immunity.

FIGURE 18.13 This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte, which is responsible for the cell-mediated immune response. The
spike-like membrane structures increase surface area, allowing for greater interaction with other cell types and their signals. (credit:

T Cell Production and Maturation

T cells, like all other white blood cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity, are formed from multipotent
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (see Figure 17.12). However, unlike the white blood cells of
innate immunity, eventual T cells differentiate first into lymphoid stem cells that then become small, immature
lymphocytes, sometimes called lymphoblasts. The first steps of differentiation occur in the red marrow of bones
(Figure 18.14), after which immature T lymphocytes enter the bloodstream and travel to the thymus for the final
steps of maturation (Figure 18.15). Once in the thymus, the immature T lymphocytes are referred to as thymocytes.

The maturation of thymocytes within the thymus can be divided into three critical steps of positive and negative
selection, collectively referred to as thymic selection. The first step of thymic selection occurs in the cortex of the
thymus and involves the development of a functional T-cell receptor (TCR) that is required for activation by APCs.
712  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     Thymocytes with defective TCRs are removed by negative selection through the induction of apoptosis
     (programmed controlled cell death). The second step of thymic selection also occurs in the cortex and involves the
     positive selection of thymocytes that will interact appropriately with MHC molecules. Thymocytes that can interact
     appropriately with MHC molecules receive a positive stimulation that moves them further through the process of
     maturation, whereas thymocytes that do not interact appropriately are not stimulated and are eliminated by
     apoptosis. The third and final step of thymic selection occurs in both the cortex and medulla and involves negative
     selection to remove self-reacting thymocytes, those that react to self-antigens, by apoptosis. This final step is
     sometimes referred to as central tolerance because it prevents self-reacting T cells from reaching the bloodstream
     and potentially causing autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system attacks healthy "self" cells.

     Despite central tolerance, some self-reactive T cells generally escape the thymus and enter the peripheral
     bloodstream. Therefore, a second line of defense called peripheral tolerance is needed to protect against
     autoimmune disease. Peripheral tolerance involves mechanisms of anergy and inhibition of self-reactive T cells by
     regulatory T cells. Anergy refers to a state of nonresponsiveness to antigen stimulation. In the case of self-reactive
     T cells that escape the thymus, lack of an essential co-stimulatory signal required for activation causes anergy and
     prevents autoimmune activation. Regulatory T cells participate in peripheral tolerance by inhibiting the activation
     and function of self-reactive T cells and by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines.

     It is not completely understood what events specifically direct maturation of thymocytes into regulatory T cells.
     Current theories suggest the critical events may occur during the third step of thymic selection, when most self-
     reactive T cells are eliminated. Regulatory T cells may receive a unique signal that is below the threshold required to
     target them for negative selection and apoptosis. Consequently, these cells continue to mature and then exit the
     thymus, armed to inhibit the activation of self-reactive T cells.

     It has been estimated that the three steps of thymic selection eliminate 98% of thymocytes. The remaining 2% that
     exit the thymus migrate through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to sites of secondary lymphoid organs/
     tissues, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils (Figure 18.15), where they await activation through the
     presentation of specific antigens by APCs. Until they are activated, they are known as mature naïve T cells.

Classes of T Cells

T cells can be categorized into three distinct classes: helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and cytotoxic T cells. These
classes are differentiated based on their expression of certain surface molecules, their mode of activation, and their
functional roles in adaptive immunity (Table 18.1).

All T cells produce cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules, cell surface glycoproteins that can be used to identify
and distinguish between the various types of white blood cells. Although T cells can produce a variety of CD
molecules, CD4 and CD8 are the two most important used for differentiation of the classes. Helper T cells and
regulatory T cells are characterized by the expression of CD4 on their surface, whereas cytotoxic T cells are
characterized by the expression of CD8.

Classes of T cells can also be distinguished by the specific MHC molecules and APCs with which they interact for
activation. Helper T cells and regulatory T cells can only be activated by APCs presenting antigens associated with
MHC II. In contrast, cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens presented in association with MHC I, either by APCs or by
nucleated cells infected with an intracellular pathogen.

The different classes of T cells also play different functional roles in the immune system. Helper T cells serve as the
central orchestrators that help activate and direct functions of humoral and cellular immunity. In addition, helper T
cells enhance the pathogen-killing functions of macrophages and NK cells of innate immunity. In contrast, the
primary role of regulatory T cells is to prevent undesirable and potentially damaging immune responses. Their role
in peripheral tolerance, for example, protects against autoimmune disorders, as discussed earlier. Finally, cytotoxic
T cells are the primary effector cells for cellular immunity. They recognize and target cells that have been infected
by intracellular pathogens, destroying infected cells along with the pathogens inside.

     T-Cell Receptors

     For both helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, activation is a complex process that requires the interactions of
     multiple molecules and exposure to cytokines. The T-cell receptor (TCR) is involved in the first step of pathogen
     epitope recognition during the activation process.

     The TCR comes from the same receptor family as the antibodies IgD and IgM, the antigen receptors on the B cell
     membrane surface, and thus shares common structural elements. Similar to antibodies, the TCR has a variable
     region and a constant region, and the variable region provides the antigen-binding site (Figure 18.16). However, the
     structure of TCR is smaller and less complex than the immunoglobulin molecules (Figure 18.5). Whereas
     immunoglobulins have four peptide chains and Y-shaped structures, the TCR consists of just two peptide chains (
     and  chains), both of which span the cytoplasmic membrane of the T cell.

     TCRs are epitope-specific, and it has been estimated that 25 million T cells with unique epitope-binding TCRs are
     required to protect an individual against a wide range of microbial pathogens. Because the human genome only
     contains about 25,000 genes, we know that each specific TCR cannot be encoded by its own set of genes. This
     raises the question of how such a vast population of T cells with millions of specific TCRs can be achieved. The
     answer is a process called genetic rearrangement, which occurs in the thymus during the first step of thymic
     selection.

     The genes that code for the variable regions of the TCR are divided into distinct gene segments called variable (V),
     diversity (D), and joining (J) segments. The genes segments associated with the  chain of the TCR consist 70 or
     more different V segments and 61 different J segments. The gene segments associated with the  chain of the
     TCR consist of 52 different V segments, two different D segments, and 13 different J segments. During the
     development of the functional TCR in the thymus, genetic rearrangement in a T cell brings together one V segment
     and one J segment to code for the variable region of the  chain. Similarly, genetic rearrangement brings one of the
     V segments together with one of the D segments and one of thetJ segments to code for the variable region of the
      chain. All the possible combinations of rearrangements between different segments of V, D, and J provide the
     genetic diversity required to produce millions of TCRs with unique epitope-specific variable regions.

Activation and Differentiation of Helper T Cells

Helper T cells can only be activated by APCs presenting processed foreign epitopes in association with MHC II. The
first step in the activation process is TCR recognition of the specific foreign epitope presented within the MHC II
antigen-binding cleft. The second step involves the interaction of CD4 on the helper T cell with a region of the MHC
II molecule separate from the antigen-binding cleft. This second interaction anchors the MHC II-TCR complex and
ensures that the helper T cell is recognizing both the foreign ("nonself") epitope and "self" antigen of the APC; both
recognitions are required for activation of the cell. In the third step, the APC and T cell secrete cytokines that
activate the helper T cell. The activated helper T cell then proliferates, dividing by mitosis to produce clonal naïve
helper T cells that differentiate into subtypes with different functions (Figure 18.17).
716  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     FIGURE 18.17 This illustration depicts the activation of a naïve (unactivated) helper T cell by an antigen-presenting cell and the subsequent
     proliferation and differentiation of the activated T cell into different subtypes.

     Activated helper T cells can differentiate into one of four distinct subtypes, summarized in Table 18.2. The
     differentiation process is directed by APC-secreted cytokines. Depending on which APC-secreted cytokines interact
     with an activated helper T cell, the cell may differentiate into a T helper 1 (TH1) cell, a T helper 2 (TH2) cell, or a
     memory helper T cell. The two types of helper T cells are relatively short-lived effector cells, meaning that they
     perform various functions of the immediate immune response. In contrast, memory helper T cells are relatively
     long lived; they are programmed to "remember" a specific antigen or epitope in order to mount a rapid, strong,
     secondary response to subsequent exposures.

     TH1 cells secrete their own cytokines that are involved in stimulating and orchestrating other cells involved in
     adaptive and innate immunity. For example, they stimulate cytotoxic T cells, enhancing their killing of infected cells
     and promoting differentiation into memory cytotoxic T cells. TH1 cells also stimulate macrophages and neutrophils
     to become more effective in their killing of intracellular bacteria. They can also stimulate NK cells to become more
     effective at killing target cells.

     TH2 cells play an important role in orchestrating the humoral immune response through their secretion of cytokines
     that activate B cells and direct B cell differentiation and antibody production. Various cytokines produced by TH2
     cells orchestrate antibody class switching, which allows B cells to switch between the production of IgM, IgG, IgA,
     and IgE as needed to carry out specific antibody functions and to provide pathogen-specific humoral immune
     responses.

     A third subtype of helper T cells called TH17 cells was discovered through observations that immunity to some
     infections is not associated with TH1 or TH2 cells. TH17 cells and the cytokines they produce appear to be
     specifically responsible for the body's defense against chronic mucocutaneous infections. Patients who lack
     sufficient TH17 cells in the mucosa (e.g., HIV patients) may be more susceptible to bacteremia and gastrointestinal
     infections.1

TABLE 18.2

Activation and Differentiation of Cytotoxic T Cells

Cytotoxic T cells (also referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs) are activated by APCs in a three-step process
similar to that of helper T cells. The key difference is that the activation of cytotoxic T cells involves recognition of an
antigen presented with MHC I (as opposed to MHC II) and interaction of CD8 (as opposed to CD4) with the receptor
complex. After the successful co-recognition of foreign epitope and self-antigen, the production of cytokines by the
APC and the cytotoxic T cell activate clonal proliferation and differentiation. Activated cytotoxic T cells can
differentiate into effector cytotoxic T cells that target pathogens for destruction or memory cells that are ready to
respond to subsequent exposures.

As noted, proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells is also stimulated by cytokines secreted from TH1 cells
activated by the same foreign epitope. The co-stimulation that comes from these TH1 cells is provided by secreted
cytokines. Although it is possible for activation of cytotoxic T cells to occur without stimulation from TH1 cells, the
activation is not as effective or long-lasting.

Once activated, cytotoxic T cells serve as the effector cells of cellular immunity, recognizing and kill cells infected
with intracellular pathogens through a mechanism very similar to that of NK cells. However, whereas NK cells
recognize nonspecific signals of cell stress or abnormality, cytotoxic T cells recognize infected cells through antigen
presentation of pathogen-specific epitopes associated with MHC I. Once an infected cell is recognized, the TCR of
the cytotoxic T cell binds to the epitope and releases perforin and granzymes that destroy the infected cell (Figure
18.18). Perforin is a protein that creates pores in the target cell, and granzymes are proteases that enter the pores
and induce apoptosis. This mechanism of programmed cell death is a controlled and efficient means of destroying
and removing infected cells without releasing the pathogens inside to infect neighboring cells, as might occur if the
infected cells were simply lysed.

     Superantigens and Unregulated Activation of T Cells

     When T cell activation is controlled and regulated, the result is a protective response that is effective in combating
     infections. However, if T cell activation is unregulated and excessive, the result can be life-threatening. Certain
     bacterial and viral pathogens produce toxins known as superantigens (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral
     Pathogens) that can trigger such an unregulated response. Known bacterial superantigens include toxic shock
     syndrome toxin (TSST), staphylococcal enterotoxins, streptococcal pyrogenic toxins, streptococcal superantigen,
     and the streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin. Viruses known to produce superantigens include Epstein-Barr virus
     (human herpesvirus 4), cytomegalovirus (human herpesvirus 5), and others.
     The mechanism of T cell activation by superantigens involves their simultaneous binding to MHC II molecules of
     APCs and the variable region of the TCR  chain. This binding occurs outside of the antigen-binding cleft of MHC II,
     so the superantigen will bridge together and activate MHC II and TCR without specific foreign epitope recognition
     (Figure 18.19). The result is an excessive, uncontrolled release of cytokines, often called a cytokine storm, which
     stimulates an excessive inflammatory response. This can lead to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure, shock,
     multi-organ failure, and potentially, death.

  Superantigens

  Melissa, an otherwise healthy 22-year-old woman, is brought to the emergency room by her concerned
  boyfriend. She complains of a sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. In her initial
  interview, she tells the attending physician that she is on hormonal birth control and also is two days into the
  menstruation portion of her cycle. She is on no other medications and is not abusing any drugs or alcohol. She is
  not a smoker. She is not diabetic and does not currently have an infection of any kind to her knowledge.

  While waiting in the emergency room, Melissa's blood pressure begins to drop dramatically and her mental state
  deteriorates to general confusion. The physician believes she is likely suffering from toxic shock syndrome (TSS).
  TSS is caused by the toxin TSST-1, a superantigen associated with Staphylococcus aureus, and improper
  tampon use is a common cause of infections leading to TSS. The superantigen inappropriately stimulates
  widespread T cell activation and excessive cytokine release, resulting in a massive and systemic inflammatory
  response that can be fatal.

  Vaginal or cervical swabs may be taken to confirm the presence of the microbe, but these tests are not critical to
  perform based on Melissa's symptoms and medical history. The physician prescribes rehydration, supportive
  therapy, and antibiotics to stem the bacterial infection. She also prescribes drugs to increase Melissa's blood
  pressure. Melissa spends three days in the hospital undergoing treatment; in addition, her kidney function is
  monitored because of the high risk of kidney failure associated with TSS. After 72 hours, Melissa is well enough
  to be discharged to continue her recovery at home.

     18.4 B Lymphocytes and Humoral Immunity

         · Describe the production and maturation of B cells

         · Compare T-dependent and T-independent activation of B cells
         · Compare the primary and secondary antibody responses

     Humoral immunity refers to mechanisms of the adaptive immune defenses that are mediated by antibodies
     secreted by B lymphocytes, or B cells. This section will focus on B cells and discuss their production and maturation,
     receptors, and mechanisms of activation.

     B Cell Production and Maturation

     Like T cells, B cells are formed from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow and follow a
     pathway through lymphoid stem cell and lymphoblast (see Figure 17.12). Unlike T cells, however, lymphoblasts
     destined to become B cells do not leave the bone marrow and travel to the thymus for maturation. Rather, eventual
     B cells continue to mature in the bone marrow.

     The first step of B cell maturation is an assessment of the functionality of their antigen-binding receptors. This
     occurs through positive selection for B cells with normal functional receptors. A mechanism of negative selection is
     then used to eliminate self-reacting B cells and minimize the risk of autoimmunity. Negative selection of self-
     reacting B cells can involve elimination by apoptosis, editing or modification of the receptors so they are no longer
     self-reactive, or induction of anergy in the B cell. Immature B cells that pass the selection in the bone marrow then
     travel to the spleen for their final stages of maturation. There they become naïve mature B cells, i.e., mature B cells
     that have not yet been activated.

     B-Cell Receptors

     Like T cells, B cells possess antigen-specific receptors with diverse specificities. Although they rely on T cells for
     optimum function, B cells can be activated without help from T cells. B-cell receptors (BCRs) for naïve mature B
     cells are membrane-bound monomeric forms of IgD and IgM. They have two identical heavy chains and two
     identical light chains connected by disulfide bonds into a basic "Y" shape (Figure 18.20). The trunk of the Y-shaped

molecule, the constant region of the two heavy chains, spans the B cell membrane. The two antigen-binding sites
exposed to the exterior of the B cell are involved in the binding of specific pathogen epitopes to initiate the
activation process. It is estimated that each naïve mature B cell has upwards of 100,000 BCRs on its membrane,
and each of these BCRs has an identical epitope-binding specificity.

In order to be prepared to react to a wide range of microbial epitopes, B cells, like T cells, use genetic
rearrangement of hundreds of gene segments to provide the necessary diversity of receptor specificities. The
variable region of the BCR heavy chain is made up of V, D, and J segments, similar to the  chain of the TCR. The
variable region of the BCR light chain is made up of V and J segments, similar to the  chain of the TCR. Genetic
rearrangement of all possible combinations of V-J-D (heavy chain) and V-J (light chain) provides for millions of
unique antigen-binding sites for the BCR and for the antibodies secreted after activation.

One important difference between BCRs and TCRs is the way they can interact with antigenic epitopes. Whereas
TCRs can only interact with antigenic epitopes that are presented within the antigen-binding cleft of MHC I or MHC
II, BCRs do not require antigen presentation with MHC; they can interact with epitopes on free antigens or with
epitopes displayed on the surface of intact pathogens. Another important difference is that TCRs only recognize
protein epitopes, whereas BCRs can recognize epitopes associated with different molecular classes (e.g., proteins,
polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides).

Activation of B cells occurs through different mechanisms depending on the molecular class of the antigen.
Activation of a B cell by a protein antigen requires the B cell to function as an APC, presenting the protein epitopes
with MHC II to helper T cells. Because of their dependence on T cells for activation of B cells, protein antigens are
classified as T-dependent antigens. In contrast, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and other nonprotein
antigens are considered T-independent antigens because they can activate B cells without antigen processing and
presentation to T cells.

FIGURE 18.20 B-cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells. The variable regions of all of the receptors on a single cell bind
the same specific antigen.

T Cell-Independent Activation of B cells
Activation of B cells without the cooperation of helper T cells is referred to as T cell-independent activation and
722  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     occurs when BCRs interact with T-independent antigens. T-independent antigens (e.g., polysaccharide capsules,
     lipopolysaccharide) have repetitive epitope units within their structure, and this repetition allows for the cross-
     linkage of multiple BCRs, providing the first signal for activation (Figure 18.21). Because T cells are not involved, the
     second signal has to come from other sources, such as interactions of toll-like receptors with PAMPs or interactions
     with factors from the complement system.

     Once a B cell is activated, it undergoes clonal proliferation and daughter cells differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma
     cells are antibody factories that secrete large quantities of antibodies. After differentiation, the surface BCRs
     disappear and the plasma cell secretes pentameric IgM molecules that have the same antigen specificity as the
     BCRs (Figure 18.21).

     The T cell-independent response is short-lived and does not result in the production of memory B cells. Thus it will
     not result in a secondary response to subsequent exposures to T-independent antigens.

     FIGURE 18.21 T-independent antigens have repeating epitopes that can induce B cell recognition and activation without involvement from
     T cells. A second signal, such as interaction of TLRs with PAMPs (not shown), is also required for activation of the B cell. Once activated, the
     B cell proliferates and differentiates into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

         · What is the function of a plasma cell?

     T Cell-Dependent Activation of B cells
     T cell-dependent activation of B cells is more complex than T cell-independent activation, but the resulting immune
     response is stronger and develops memory. T cell-dependent activation can occur either in response to free protein
     antigens or to protein antigens associated with an intact pathogen. Interaction between the BCRs on a naïve mature
     B cell and a free protein antigen stimulate internalization of the antigen, whereas interaction with antigens
     associated with an intact pathogen initiates the extraction of the antigen from the pathogen before internalization.
     Once internalized inside the B cell, the protein antigen is processed and presented with MHC II. The presented
     antigen is then recognized by helper T cells specific to the same antigen. The TCR of the helper T cell recognizes the
     foreign antigen, and the T cell's CD4 molecule interacts with MHC II on the B cell. The coordination between B cells
     and helper T cells that are specific to the same antigen is referred to as linked recognition.

     Once activated by linked recognition, TH2 cells produce and secrete cytokines that activate the B cell and cause
     proliferation into clonal daughter cells. After several rounds of proliferation, additional cytokines provided by the
     TH2 cells stimulate the differentiation of activated B cell clones into memory B cells, which will quickly respond to
     subsequent exposures to the same protein epitope, and plasma cells that lose their membrane BCRs and initially
     secrete pentameric IgM (Figure 18.22).

     After initial secretion of IgM, cytokines secreted by TH2 cells stimulate the plasma cells to switch from IgM
     production to production of IgG, IgA, or IgE. This process, called class switching or isotype switching, allows

plasma cells cloned from the same activated B cell to produce a variety of antibody classes with the same epitope
specificity. Class switching is accomplished by genetic rearrangement of gene segments encoding the constant
region, which determines an antibody's class. The variable region is not changed, so the new class of antibody
retains the original epitope specificity.

FIGURE 18.22 In T cell-dependent activation of B cells, the B cell recognizes and internalizes an antigen and presents it to a helper T cell
that is specific to the same antigen. The helper T cell interacts with the antigen presented by the B cell, which activates the T cell and
stimulates the release of cytokines that then activate the B cell. Activation of the B cell triggers proliferation and differentiation into B cells
and plasma cells.

Primary and Secondary Responses

T cell-dependent activation of B cells plays an important role in both the primary and secondary responses
associated with adaptive immunity. With the first exposure to a protein antigen, a T cell-dependent primary antibody
response occurs. The initial stage of the primary response is a lag period, or latent period, of approximately 10
days, during which no antibody can be detected in serum. This lag period is the time required for all of the steps of
the primary response, including naïve mature B cell binding of antigen with BCRs, antigen processing and
724  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     presentation, helper T cell activation, B cell activation, and clonal proliferation. The end of the lag period is
     characterized by a rise in IgM levels in the serum, as TH2 cells stimulate B cell differentiation into plasma cells. IgM
     levels reach their peak around 14 days after primary antigen exposure; at about this same time, TH2 stimulates
     antibody class switching, and IgM levels in serum begin to decline. Meanwhile, levels of IgG increase until they
     reach a peak about three weeks into the primary response (Figure 18.23).

     During the primary response, some of the cloned B cells are differentiated into memory B cells programmed to
     respond to subsequent exposures. This secondary response occurs more quickly and forcefully than the primary
     response. The lag period is decreased to only a few days and the production of IgG is significantly higher than
     observed for the primary response (Figure 18.23). In addition, the antibodies produced during the secondary
     response are more effective and bind with higher affinity to the targeted epitopes. Plasma cells produced during
     secondary responses live longer than those produced during the primary response, so levels of specific antibody
     remain elevated for a longer period of time.

     FIGURE 18.23 Compared to the primary response, the secondary antibody response occurs more quickly and produces antibody levels that
     are higher and more sustained. The secondary response mostly involves IgG.

     effective as vaccination. Vaccination is a form of artificial immunity. By artificially stimulating the adaptive immune
     defenses, a vaccine triggers memory cell production similar to that which would occur during a primary response. In
     so doing, the patient is able to mount a strong secondary response upon exposure to the pathogen--but without
     having to first suffer through an initial infection. In this section, we will explore several different kinds of artificial
     immunity along with various types of vaccines and the mechanisms by which they induce artificial immunity.

     Classifications of Adaptive Immunity

     All forms of adaptive immunity can be described as either active or passive. Active immunity refers to the activation

of an individual's own adaptive immune defenses, whereas passive immunity refers to the transfer of adaptive
immune defenses from another individual or animal. Active and passive immunity can be further subdivided based
on whether the protection is acquired naturally or artificially.

Natural active immunity is adaptive immunity that develops after natural exposure to a pathogen (Figure 18.24).
Examples would include the lifelong immunity that develops after recovery from a chickenpox or measles infection
(although an acute infection is not always necessary to activate adaptive immunity). The length of time that an
individual is protected can vary substantially depending upon the pathogen and antigens involved. For example,
activation of adaptive immunity by protein spike structures during an intracellular viral infection can activate lifelong
immunity, whereas activation by carbohydrate capsule antigens during an extracellular bacterial infection may
activate shorter-term immunity.

Natural passive immunity involves the natural passage of antibodies from a female to a child before and after birth.
IgG is the only antibody class that can cross the placenta from a pregnant person's blood to the fetal blood supply.
Placental transfer of IgG is an important passive immune defense for the infant, lasting up to six months after birth.
Secretory IgA can also be transferred from to an infant through breast milk.

Artificial passive immunity refers to the transfer of antibodies produced by a donor (human or animal) to another
individual. This transfer of antibodies may be done as a prophylactic measure (i.e., to prevent disease after exposure
to a pathogen) or as a strategy for treating an active infection. For example, artificial passive immunity is commonly
used for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and chickenpox (in high risk individuals).
Active infections treated by artificial passive immunity include cytomegalovirus infections in immunocompromised
patients and Ebola virus infections. In 1995, eight patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with active
Ebola infections were treated with blood transfusions from patients who were recovering from Ebola. Only one of
the eight patients died (a 12.5% mortality rate), which was much lower than the expected 80% mortality rate for
Ebola in untreated patients.2 Artificial passive immunity is also used for the treatment of diseases caused by
bacterial toxins, including tetanus, botulism, and diphtheria.

Artificial active immunity is the foundation for vaccination. It involves the activation of adaptive immunity through
the deliberate exposure of an individual to weakened or inactivated pathogens, or preparations consisting of key
pathogen antigens.

     Herd Immunity
     The four kinds of immunity just described result from an individual's adaptive immune system. For any given
     disease, an individual may be considered immune or susceptible depending on their ability to mount an effective
     immune response upon exposure. Thus, any given population is likely to have some individuals who are immune and
     other individuals who are susceptible. If a population has very few susceptible individuals, even those susceptible
     individuals will be protected by a phenomenon called herd immunity. Herd immunity has nothing to do with an
     individual's ability to mount an effective immune response; rather, it occurs because there are too few susceptible
     individuals in a population for the disease to spread effectively.
     Vaccination programs create herd immunity by greatly reducing the number of susceptible individuals in a
     population. Even if some individuals in the population are not vaccinated, as long as a certain percentage is immune
     (either naturally or artificially), the few susceptible individuals are unlikely to be exposed to the pathogen. However,
     because new individuals are constantly entering populations (for example, through birth or relocation), vaccination
     programs are necessary to maintain herd immunity.

EYE ON ETHICS

Vaccination: Obligation or Choice

A growing number of parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children. They are dubbed "antivaxxers," and
the majority of them believe that vaccines are a cause of autism (or other disease conditions), a link that has
now been thoroughly disproven. Others object to vaccines on religious or moral grounds (e.g., the argument that
Gardasil vaccination against HPV may promote sexual promiscuity), on personal ethical grounds (e.g., a
conscientious objection to any medical intervention), or on political grounds (e.g., the notion that mandatory
vaccinations are a violation of individual liberties).3

It is believed that this growing number of unvaccinated individuals has led to new outbreaks of whooping cough
and measles. We would expect that herd immunity would protect those unvaccinated in our population, but herd
immunity can only be maintained if enough individuals are being vaccinated.

Vaccination is clearly beneficial for public health. But from the individual parent's perspective the view can be
murkier. Vaccines, like all medical interventions, have associated risks, and while the risks of vaccination may be
extremely low compared to the risks of infection, parents may not always understand or accept the consensus of
the medical community. Do such parents have a right to withhold vaccination from their children? Should they be
allowed to put their children--and society at large--at risk?

Many governments insist on childhood vaccinations as a condition for entering public school, but it has become
easy in most states to opt out of the requirement or to keep children out of the public system. Since the 1970s,
West Virginia and Mississippi have had in place a stringent requirement for childhood vaccination, without
exceptions, and neither state has had a case of measles since the early 1990s. California lawmakers recently
passed a similar law in response to a measles outbreak in 2015, making it much more difficult for parents to opt
out of vaccines if their children are attending public schools. Given this track record and renewed legislative
efforts, should other states adopt similarly strict requirements?

What role should health-care providers play in promoting or enforcing universal vaccination? Studies have
shown that many parents' minds can be changed in response to information delivered by health-care workers,
but is it the place of health-care workers to try to persuade parents to have their children vaccinated? Some
health-care providers are understandably reluctant to treat unvaccinated patients. Do they have the right to
refuse service to patients who decline vaccines? Do insurance companies have the right to deny coverage to
antivaxxers? These are all ethical questions that policymakers may be forced to address as more parents skirt
vaccination norms.

Variolation and Vaccination

Thousands of years ago, it was first recognized that individuals who survived a smallpox infection were immune to
subsequent infections. The practice of inoculating individuals to actively protect them from smallpox appears to
have originated in the 10th century in China, when the practice of variolation was described (Figure 18.25).
Variolation refers to the deliberate inoculation of individuals with infectious material from scabs or pustules of
smallpox victims. Infectious materials were either injected into the skin or introduced through the nasal route. The
infection that developed was usually milder than naturally acquired smallpox, and recovery from the milder infection
provided protection against the more serious disease.

Although the majority of individuals treated by variolation developed only mild infections, the practice was not
without risks. More serious and sometimes fatal infections did occur, and because smallpox was contagious,
infections resulting from variolation could lead to epidemics. Even so, the practice of variolation for smallpox
prevention spread to other regions, including India, Africa, and Europe.

     FIGURE 18.25 Variolation for smallpox originated in the Far East and the practice later spread to Europe and Africa. This Japanese relief
     depicts a patient receiving a smallpox variolation from the physician Ogata Shunsaku (1748-1810).

     Although variolation had been practiced for centuries, the English physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) is
     generally credited with developing the modern process of vaccination. Jenner observed that cow milkers who
     developed cowpox, a disease similar to smallpox but milder, were immune to the more serious smallpox. This led
     Jenner to hypothesize that exposure to a less virulent pathogen could provide immune protection against a more
     virulent pathogen, providing a safer alternative to variolation. In 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by obtaining
     infectious samples from a person's active cowpox lesion and injecting the materials into a young boy (Figure 18.26).
     The boy developed a mild infection that included a low-grade fever, discomfort in his axillae (armpit) and loss of
     appetite. When the boy was later infected with infectious samples from smallpox lesions, he did not contract
     smallpox.4 This new approach was termed vaccination, a name deriving from the use of cowpox (Latin vacca
     meaning "cow") to protect against smallpox. Today, we know that Jenner's vaccine worked because the cowpox
     virus is genetically and antigenically related to the Variola viruses that caused smallpox. Exposure to cowpox
     antigens resulted in a primary response and the production of memory cells that identical or related epitopes of
     Variola virus upon a later exposure to smallpox.
     The success of Jenner's smallpox vaccination led other scientists to develop vaccines for other diseases. Perhaps
     the most notable was Louis Pasteur, who developed vaccines for rabies, cholera, and anthrax. During the 20th and
     21st centuries, effective vaccines were developed to prevent a wide range of diseases caused by viruses (e.g.,
     chickenpox and shingles, hepatitis, measles, mumps, polio, and yellow fever) and bacteria (e.g., diphtheria,
     pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and whooping cough,).

    · What is the difference between variolation and vaccination for smallpox?
    · Explain why vaccination is less risky than variolation.

Classes of Vaccines

For a vaccine to provide protection against a disease, it must expose an individual to pathogen-specific antigens that
will stimulate a protective adaptive immune response. By its very nature, this entails some risk. As with any
pharmaceutical drug, vaccines have the potential to cause adverse effects. However, the ideal vaccine causes no
severe adverse effects and poses no risk of contracting the disease that it is intended to prevent. Various types of
vaccines have been developed with these goals in mind. These different classes of vaccines are described in the
next section and summarized in Table 18.3.

Live Attenuated Vaccines
Live attenuated vaccines expose an individual to a weakened strain of a pathogen with the goal of establishing a
subclinical infection that will activate the adaptive immune defenses. Pathogens are attenuated to decrease their
virulence using methods such as genetic manipulation (to eliminate key virulence factors) or long-term culturing in
an unnatural host or environment (to promote mutations and decrease virulence).

By establishing an active infection, live attenuated vaccines stimulate a more comprehensive immune response than
some other types of vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines activate both cellular and humoral immunity and stimulate
the development of memory for long-lasting immunity. In some cases, vaccination of one individual with a live
attenuated pathogen can even lead to natural transmission of the attenuated pathogen to other individuals. This can
cause the other individuals to also develop an active, subclinical infection that activates their adaptive immune
defenses.

Disadvantages associated with live attenuated vaccines include the challenges associated with long-term storage
and transport as well as the potential for a patient to develop signs and symptoms of disease during the active
infection (particularly in immunocompromised patients). There is also a risk of the attenuated pathogen reverting
back to full virulence. Table 18.3 lists examples live attenuated vaccines.

Inactivated Vaccines
Inactivated vaccines contain whole pathogens that have been killed or inactivated with heat, chemicals, or
radiation. For inactivated vaccines to be effective, the inactivation process must not affect the structure of key
antigens on the pathogen.

Because the pathogen is killed or inactive, inactivated vaccines do not produce an active infection, and the resulting
immune response is weaker and less comprehensive than that provoked by a live attenuated vaccine. Typically the
response involves only humoral immunity, and the pathogen cannot be transmitted to other individuals. In addition,
inactivated vaccines usually require higher doses and multiple boosters, possibly causing inflammatory reactions at
the site of injection.

Despite these disadvantages, inactivated vaccines do have the advantages of long-term storage stability and ease of
transport. Also, there is no risk of causing severe active infections. However, inactivated vaccines are not without
their side effects. Table 18.3 lists examples of inactivated vaccines.

Subunit Vaccines
Whereas live attenuated and inactive vaccines expose an individual to a weakened or dead pathogen, subunit
vaccines only expose the patient to the key antigens of a pathogen--not whole cells or viruses. Subunit vaccines can
be produced either by chemically degrading a pathogen and isolating its key antigens or by producing the antigens
through genetic engineering. Because these vaccines contain only the essential antigens of a pathogen, the risk of
side effects is relatively low. Table 18.3 lists examples of subunit vaccines.

Toxoid Vaccines
Like subunit vaccines, toxoid vaccines do not introduce a whole pathogen to the patient; they contain inactivated
bacterial toxins, called toxoids. Toxoid vaccines are used to prevent diseases in which bacterial toxins play an
730  18 · Adaptive Specific Host Defenses

     important role in pathogenesis. These vaccines activate humoral immunity that neutralizes the toxins. Table 18.3
     lists examples of toxoid vaccines.

     Conjugate Vaccines
     A conjugate vaccine is a type of subunit vaccine that consists of a protein conjugated to a capsule polysaccharide.
     Conjugate vaccines have been developed to enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines against pathogens that have
     protective polysaccharide capsules that help them evade phagocytosis, causing invasive infections that can lead to
     meningitis and other serious conditions. The subunit vaccines against these pathogens introduce T-independent
     capsular polysaccharide antigens that result in the production of antibodies that can opsonize the capsule and thus
     combat the infection; however, children under the age of two years do not respond effectively to these vaccines.
     Children do respond effectively when vaccinated with the conjugate vaccine, in which a protein with T-dependent
     antigens is conjugated to the capsule polysaccharide. The conjugated protein-polysaccharide antigen stimulates
     production of antibodies against both the protein and the capsule polysaccharide. Table 18.3 lists examples of
     conjugate vaccines.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

DNA Vaccines

DNA vaccines represent a relatively new and promising approach to vaccination. A DNA vaccine is produced by
incorporating genes for antigens into a recombinant plasmid vaccine. Introduction of the DNA vaccine into a patient
leads to uptake of the recombinant plasmid by some of the patient's cells, followed by transcription and translation
of antigens and presentation of these antigens with MHC I to activate adaptive immunity. This results in the
stimulation of both humoral and cellular immunity without the risk of active disease associated with live attenuated
vaccines.

Although most DNA vaccines for humans are still in development, it is likely that they will become more prevalent in
the near future as researchers are working on engineering DNA vaccines that will activate adaptive immunity against
several different pathogens at once. First-generation DNA vaccines tested in the 1990s looked promising in animal
models but were disappointing when tested in human subjects. Poor cellular uptake of the DNA plasmids was one of
the major problems impacting their efficacy. Trials of second-generation DNA vaccines have been more promising
thanks to new techniques for enhancing cellular uptake and optimizing antigens. DNA vaccines for various cancers
and viral pathogens such as HIV, HPV, and hepatitis B and C are currently in development.

Some DNA vaccines are already in use. In 2005, a DNA vaccine against West Nile virus was approved for use in
horses in the United States. Canada has also approved a DNA vaccine to protect fish from infectious hematopoietic
necrosis virus.5 A DNA vaccine against Japanese encephalitis virus was approved for use in humans in 2010 in
Australia.6

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Resolution

       Based on Olivia's symptoms, her physician made a preliminary diagnosis of bacterial meningitis without waiting
       for positive identification from the blood and CSF samples sent to the lab. Olivia was admitted to the hospital
       and treated with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and rehydration therapy. Over the next several days,
       her condition began to improve, and new blood samples and lumbar puncture samples showed an absence of
       microbes in the blood and CSF with levels of white blood cells returning to normal. During this time, the lab
       produced a positive identification of Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis, in
       her original CSF sample.

       N. meningitidis produces a polysaccharide capsule that serves as a virulence factor. N. meningitidis tends to
       affect infants after they begin to lose the natural passive immunity provided by maternal antibodies. At one year
       of age, Olivia's maternal IgG antibodies would have disappeared, and she would not have developed memory
       cells capable of recognizing antigens associated with the polysaccharide capsule of the N. meningitidis. As a
       result, her adaptive immune system was unable to produce protective antibodies to combat the infection, and
       without antibiotics she may not have survived. Olivia's infection likely would have been avoided altogether had
       she been vaccinated. A conjugate vaccine to prevent meningococcal meningitis is available and approved for
       infants as young as two months of age. However, current vaccination schedules in the United States recommend
       that the vaccine be administered at age 11-12 with a booster at age 16.

an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen) in case of a sting. A bee-sting allergy is an example of an immune response that is harmful to the

INTRODUCTION An allergic reaction is an immune response to a type of antigen called an allergen. Allergens can
be found in many different items, from peanuts and insect stings to latex and some drugs. Unlike other kinds of
antigens, allergens are not necessarily associated with pathogenic microbes, and many allergens provoke no
immune response at all in most people.
Allergic responses vary in severity. Some are mild and localized, like hay fever or hives, but others can result in
systemic, life-threatening reactions. Anaphylaxis, for example, is a rapidly developing allergic reaction that can
cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure and severe swelling of the throat that may close off the airway.
Allergies are just one example of how the immune system--the system normally responsible for preventing
disease--can actually cause or mediate disease symptoms. In this chapter, we will further explore allergies and
other disorders of the immune system, including hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune diseases, transplant
rejection, and diseases associated with immunodeficiency.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Kerry, a 40-year-old airline pilot, has made an appointment with her primary care physician to discuss a rash
       that develops whenever she spends time in the sun. As she explains to her physician, it does not seem like
       sunburn. She is careful not to spend too much time in the sun and she uses sunscreen. Despite these
       precautions, the rash still appears, manifesting as red, raised patches that get slightly scaly. The rash persists
       for 7 to 10 days each time, and it seems to largely go away on its own. Lately, the rashes have also begun to
       appear on her cheeks and above her eyes on either side of her forehead.

           · Is Kerry right to be concerned, or should she simply be more careful about sun exposure?
           · Are there conditions that might be brought on by sun exposure that Kerry's physician should be

               considering?

     In Adaptive Specific Host Defenses, we discussed the mechanisms by which adaptive immune defenses, both
     humoral and cellular, protect us from infectious diseases. However, these same protective immune defenses can
     also be responsible for undesirable reactions called hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions are
     classified by their immune mechanism.

         · Type I hypersensitivity reactions involve immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody against soluble antigen, triggering
             mast cell degranulation.

         · Type II hypersensitivity reactions involve IgG and IgM antibodies directed against cellular antigens, leading to
             cell damage mediated by other immune system effectors.

         · Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the interactions of IgG, IgM, and, occasionally, IgA1 antibodies with
             antigen to form immune complexes. Accumulation of immune complexes in tissue leads to tissue damage
             mediated by other immune system effectors.

         · Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are T-cell-mediated reactions that can involve tissue damage mediated by
             activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells.

     Type I Hypersensitivities

     When a presensitized individual is exposed to an allergen, it can lead to a rapid immune response that occurs
     almost immediately. Such a response is called an allergy and is classified as a type I hypersensitivity. Allergens
     may be seemingly harmless substances such as animal dander, molds, or pollen. Allergens may also be substances
     considered innately more hazardous, such as insect venom or therapeutic drugs. Food intolerances can also yield
     allergic reactions as individuals become sensitized to foods such as peanuts or shellfish (Figure 19.2). Regardless of
     the allergen, the first exposure activates a primary IgE antibody response that sensitizes an individual to type I
     hypersensitivity reaction upon subsequent exposure.

sensitive individuals. (b) Skin rashes are often associated with allergic reactions. (c) Peanuts can be eaten safely by most people but can
provoke severe allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.

For susceptible individuals, a first exposure to an allergen activates a strong TH2 cell response (Figure 19.3).
Cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 from the TH2 cells activate B cells specific to the same allergen, resulting in
clonal proliferation, differentiation into plasma cells, and antibody-class switch from production of IgM to
production of IgE. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) regions of the IgE antibodies bind to specific receptors on the
surface of mast cells throughout the body. It is estimated that each mast cell can bind up to 500,000 IgE molecules,
with each IgE molecule having two allergen-specific fragment antigen-binding (Fab) sites available for binding
allergen on subsequent exposures. By the time this occurs, the allergen is often no longer present and there is no
allergic reaction, but the mast cells are primed for a subsequent exposure and the individual is sensitized to the
allergen.

On subsequent exposure, allergens bind to multiple IgE molecules on mast cells, cross-linking the IgE molecules.
Within minutes, this cross-linking of IgE activates the mast cells and triggers degranulation, a reaction in which the
contents of the granules in the mast cell are released into the extracellular environment. Preformed components
that are released from granules include histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin (Table 19.1). The activated mast cells
also release newly formed lipid mediators (leukotrienes and prostaglandins from membrane arachadonic acid
metabolism) and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (Table 19.2).

The chemical mediators released by mast cells collectively cause the inflammation and signs and symptoms
associated with type I hypersensitivity reactions. Histamine stimulates mucus secretion in nasal passages and tear
formation from lacrimal glands, promoting the runny nose and watery eyes of allergies. Interaction of histamine with
nerve endings causes itching and sneezing. The vasodilation caused by several of the mediators can result in hives,
headaches, angioedema (swelling that often affects the lips, throat, and tongue), and hypotension (low blood
pressure). Bronchiole constriction caused by some of the chemical mediators leads to wheezing, dyspnea (difficulty
breathing), coughing, and, in more severe cases, cyanosis (bluish color to the skin or mucous membranes). Vomiting
can result from stimulation of the vomiting center in the cerebellum by histamine and serotonin. Histamine can also
cause relaxation of intestinal smooth muscles and diarrhea.

     FIGURE 19.3 On first exposure to an allergen in a susceptible individual, antigen-presenting cells process and present allergen epitopes
     with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II to T helper cells. B cells also process and present the same allergen epitope to TH2 cells,
     which release cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 to stimulate proliferation and differentiation into IgE-secreting plasma cells. The IgE molecules
     bind to mast cells with their Fc region, sensitizing the mast cells for activation with subsequent exposure to the allergen. With each
     subsequent exposure, the allergen cross-links IgE molecules on the mast cells, activating the mast cells and causing the release of
     preformed chemical mediators from granules (degranulation), as well as newly formed chemical mediators that collectively cause the signs
     and symptoms of type I hypersensitivity reactions.

     Type I hypersensitivity reactions can be either localized or systemic. Localized type I hypersensitivity reactions
     include hay fever rhinitis, hives, and asthma (Table 19.3). Systemic type I hypersensitivity reactions are referred to
     as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Although anaphylaxis shares many symptoms common with the localized
     type I hypersensitivity reactions, the swelling of the tongue and trachea, blockage of airways, dangerous drop in
     blood pressure, and development of shock can make anaphylaxis especially severe and life-threatening. In fact,
     death can occur within minutes of onset of signs and symptoms.

     Late-phase reactions in type I hypersensitivities may develop 4-12 hours after the early phase and are mediated by
     eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes that have been recruited by chemotactic factors released from mast
     cells. Activation of these recruited cells leads to the release of more chemical mediators that cause tissue damage
     and late-phase symptoms of swelling and redness of the skin, coughing, wheezing, and nasal discharge.

Individuals who possess genes for maladaptive traits, such as intense type I hypersensitivity reactions to otherwise
harmless components of the environment, would be expected to suffer reduced reproductive success. With this kind
of evolutionary selective pressure, such traits would not be expected to persist in a population. This suggests that
type I hypersensitivities may have an adaptive function. There is evidence that the IgE produced during type I
hypersensitivity reactions is actually meant to counter helminth infections2 . Helminths are one of few organisms
that possess proteins that are targeted by IgE. In addition, there is evidence that helminth infections at a young age
reduce the likelihood of type I hypersensitivities to innocuous substances later in life. Thus it may be that allergies
are an unfortunate consequence of strong selection in the mammalian lineage or earlier for a defense against
parasitic worms.

The Hygiene Hypothesis

In most modern societies, good hygiene is associated with regular bathing, and good health with cleanliness. But
some recent studies suggest that the association between health and clean living may be a faulty one. Some go so
far as to suggest that children should be encouraged to play in the dirt--or even eat dirt3 --for the benefit of their
health. This recommendation is based on the so-called hygiene hypothesis, which proposes that childhood
exposure to antigens from a diverse range of microbes leads to a better-functioning immune system later in life.

     The hygiene hypothesis was first suggested in 1989 by David Strachan4 , who observed an inverse relationship
     between the number of older children in a family and the incidence of hay fever. Although hay fever in children had
     increased dramatically during the mid-20th century, incidence was significantly lower in families with more children.
     Strachan proposed that the lower incidence of allergies in large families could be linked to infections acquired from
     older siblings, suggesting that these infections made children less susceptible to allergies. Strachan also argued that
     trends toward smaller families and a greater emphasis on cleanliness in the 20th century had decreased exposure
     to pathogens and thus led to higher overall rates of allergies, asthma, and other immune disorders.

     Other researchers have observed an inverse relationship between the incidence of immune disorders and infectious
     diseases that are now rare in industrialized countries but still common in less industrialized countries.5 In
     developed nations, children under the age of 5 years are not exposed to many of the microbes, molecules, and
     antigens they almost certainly would have encountered a century ago. The lack of early challenges to the immune
     system by organisms with which humans and their ancestors evolved may result in failures in immune system
     functioning later in life.

     Type II (Cytotoxic) Hypersensitivities

     Immune reactions categorized as type II hypersensitivities, or cytotoxic hypersensitivities, are mediated by IgG
     and IgM antibodies binding to cell-surface antigens or matrix-associated antigens on basement membranes. These
     antibodies can either activate complement, resulting in an inflammatory response and lysis of the targeted cells, or
     they can be involved in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) with cytotoxic T cells.

     In some cases, the antigen may be a self-antigen, in which case the reaction would also be described as an
     autoimmune disease. (Autoimmune diseases are described in Autoimmune Disorders). In other cases, antibodies
     may bind to naturally occurring, but exogenous, cell-surface molecules such as antigens associated with blood
     typing found on red blood cells (RBCs). This leads to the coating of the RBCs by antibodies, activation of the
     complement cascade, and complement-mediated lysis of RBCs, as well as opsonization of RBCs for phagocytosis.
     Two examples of type II hypersensitivity reactions involving RBCs are hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) and
     hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). These type II hypersensitivity reactions, which will be discussed in greater
     detail, are summarized in Table 19.4.

     Immunohematology is the study of blood and blood-forming tissue in relation to the immune response. Antibody-
     initiated responses against blood cells are type II hypersensitivities, thus falling into the field of
     immunohematology. For students first learning about immunohematology, understanding the immunological
     mechanisms involved is made even more challenging by the complex nomenclature system used to identify
     different blood-group antigens, often called blood types. The first blood-group antigens either used alphabetical
     names or were named for the first person known to produce antibodies to the red blood cell antigen (e.g., Kell,
     Duffy, or Diego). However, in 1980, the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) Working Party on
     Terminology created a standard for blood-group terminology in an attempt to more consistently identify newly
     discovered blood group antigens. New antigens are now given a number and assigned to a blood-group system,
     collection, or series. However, even with this effort, blood-group nomenclature is still inconsistent.

ABO Blood Group Incompatibility
The recognition that individuals have different blood types was first described by Karl Landsteiner (1868-1943) in
the early 1900s, based on his observation that serum from one person could cause a clumping of RBCs from
another. These studies led Landsteiner to the identification of four distinct blood types. Subsequent research by
other scientists determined that the four blood types were based on the presence or absence of surface
carbohydrates "A" and "B," and this provided the foundation for the ABO blood group system that is still in use
today (Figure 19.4). The functions of these antigens are unknown, but some have been associated with normal
biochemical functions of the cell. Furthermore, ABO blood types are inherited as alleles (one from each parent), and
they display patterns of dominant and codominant inheritance. The alleles for A and B blood types are codominant
to each other, and both are dominant over blood type O. Therefore, individuals with genotypes of AA or AO have type
A blood and express the A carbohydrate antigen on the surface of their RBCs. People with genotypes of BB or BO
have type B blood and express the B carbohydrate antigen on the surface of their RBCs. Those with a genotype of AB
have type AB blood and express both A and B carbohydrate antigens on the surface of their RBCs. Finally, individuals
with a genotype of OO have type O blood and lack A and B carbohydrate on the surface of their RBCs.

It is important to note that the RBCs of all four ABO blood types share a common protein receptor molecule, and it is
the addition of specific carbohydrates to the protein receptors that determines A, B, and AB blood types. The genes
that are inherited for the A, B, and AB blood types encode enzymes that add the carbohydrate component to the
protein receptor. Individuals with O blood type still have the protein receptor but lack the enzymes that would add
carbohydrates that would make their red blood cell type A, B, or AB.

IgM antibodies in plasma that cross-react with blood group antigens not present on an individual's own RBCs are
called isohemagglutinins (Figure 19.4). Isohemagglutinins are produced within the first few weeks after birth and
persist throughout life. These antibodies are produced in response to exposure to environmental antigens from food
and microorganisms. A person with type A blood has A antigens on the surface of their RBCs and will produce anti-B
antibodies to environmental antigens that resemble the carbohydrate component of B antigens. A person with type
B blood has B antigens on the surface of their RBCs and will produce anti-A antibodies to environmental antigens
that are similar to the carbohydrate component of A antigens. People with blood type O lack both A and B antigens
on their RBCs and, therefore, produce both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Conversely, people with AB blood type
have both A and B antigens on their RBCs and, therefore, lack anti-A and anti-B antibodies.

     A patient may require a blood transfusion because they lack sufficient RBCs (anemia) or because they have
     experienced significant loss of blood volume through trauma or disease. Although the blood transfusion is given to
     help the patient, it is essential that the patient receive a transfusion with matching ABO blood type. A transfusion
     with an incompatible ABO blood type may lead to a strong, potentially lethal type II hypersensitivity cytotoxic
     response called hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR) (Figure 19.5).
     For instance, if a person with type B blood receives a transfusion of type A blood, their anti-A antibodies will bind to
     and agglutinate the transfused RBCs. In addition, activation of the classical complement cascade will lead to a
     strong inflammatory response, and the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) will mediate massive
     hemolysis of the transfused RBCs. The debris from damaged and destroyed RBCs can occlude blood vessels in the
     alveoli of the lungs and the glomeruli of the kidneys. Within 1 to 24 hours of an incompatible transfusion, the patient
     experiences fever, chills, pruritus (itching), urticaria (hives), dyspnea, hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine), and
     hypotension (low blood pressure). In the most serious reactions, dangerously low blood pressure can lead to shock,
     multi-organ failure, and death of the patient.
     Hospitals, medical centers, and associated clinical laboratories typically use hemovigilance systems to minimize the
     risk of HTRs due to clerical error. Hemovigilance systems are procedures that track transfusion information from the
     donor source and blood products obtained to the follow-up of recipient patients. Hemovigilance systems used in
     many countries identify HTRs and their outcomes through mandatory reporting (e.g., to the Food and Drug
     Administration in the United States), and this information is valuable to help prevent such occurrences in the future.
     For example, if an HTR is found to be the result of laboratory or clerical error, additional blood products collected
     from the donor at that time can be located and labeled correctly to avoid additional HTRs. As a result of these
     measures, HTR-associated deaths in the United States occur in about one per 2 million transfused units.6

incoming donor type A red blood cells. The bound anti-A antibodies activate the classical complement cascade, resulting in destruction of
the donor red blood cells.

Rh Factors
Many different types of erythrocyte antigens have been discovered since the description of the ABO red cell
antigens. The second most frequently described RBC antigens are Rh factors, named after the rhesus macaque
(Macaca mulatta) factors identified by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Weiner in 1940. The Rh system of RBC
antigens is the most complex and immunogenic blood group system, with more than 50 specificities identified to
date. Of all the Rh antigens, the one designated Rho (Weiner) or D (Fisher-Race) is the most immunogenic. Cells are
classified as Rh positive (Rh+) if the Rho/D antigen is present or as Rh negative (Rh-) if the Rho/D antigen is absent.
In contrast to the carbohydrate molecules that distinguish the ABO blood groups and are the targets of IgM
isohemagglutinins in HTRs, the Rh factor antigens are proteins. As discussed in B Lymphocytes and Humoral
Immunity, protein antigens activate B cells and antibody production through a T-cell-dependent mechanism, and
the TH2 cells stimulate class switching from IgM to other antibody classes. In the case of Rh factor antigens, TH2
cells stimulate class switching to IgG, and this has important implications for the mechanism of HDN.

Like ABO incompatibilities, blood transfusions from a donor with the wrong Rh factor antigens can cause a type II
hypersensitivity HTR. However, in contrast to the IgM isohemagglutinins produced early in life through exposure to
environmental antigens, production of anti-Rh factor antibodies requires the exposure of an individual with Rh-
blood to Rh+ positive RBCs and activation of a primary antibody response. Although this primary antibody response
can cause an HTR in the transfusion patient, the hemolytic reaction would be delayed up to 2 weeks during the
extended lag period of a primary antibody response (B Lymphocytes and Humoral Immunity). However, if the
patient receives a subsequent transfusion with Rh+ RBCs, a more rapid HTR would occur with anti-Rh factor
antibody already present in the blood. Furthermore, the rapid secondary antibody response would provide even
more anti-Rh factor antibodies for the HTR.

Rh factor incompatibility between a pregnant person and fetus can also cause a type II hypersensitivity hemolytic
reaction, referred to as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) (Figure 19.6). If an Rh- female carries an Rh+
baby to term, pregnant person's immune system can be exposed to Rh+ fetal red blood cells. This exposure will
usually occur during the last trimester of pregnancy and during the delivery process. If this exposure occurs, the
Rh+ fetal RBCs will activate a primary adaptive immune response in the pregnant person, and anti-Rh factor IgG
antibodies will be produced. IgG antibodies are the only class of antibody that can cross the placenta to impact the
fetus; however, in most cases, the first Rh+ baby is unaffected by these antibodies because the first exposure
typically occurs late enough in the pregnancy that the pregnant person does not have time to mount a sufficient
primary antibody response before the baby is born.

If a subsequent pregnancy with an Rh+ fetus occurs, however, the female's second exposure to the Rh factor
antigens causes a strong secondary antibody response that produces larger quantities of anti-Rh factor IgG. These
antibodies can cross the placenta to the fetus and cause HDN, a potentially lethal condition for the baby (Figure
748  19 · Diseases of the Immune System

     19.6).

     Prior to the development of techniques for diagnosis and prevention, Rh factor incompatibility was the most
     common cause of HDN, resulting in thousands of infant deaths each year worldwide.7 For this reason, the Rh factors
     of prospective parents are regularly screened, and treatments have been developed to prevent HDN caused by Rh
     incompatibility. To prevent Rh factor-mediated HDN, human Rho(D) immune globulin (e.g., RhoGAM) is injected
     intravenously or intramuscularly into pregnant people during the 28th week of pregnancy and within 72 hours after
     delivery. Additional doses may be administered after events that may result in transplacental hemorrhage (e.g.,
     umbilical blood sampling, chorionic villus sampling, abdominal trauma, amniocentesis). This treatment is initiated
     during the first pregnancy with an Rh+ fetus. The anti-Rh antibodies in Rho(D) immune globulin will bind to the Rh
     factor of any fetal RBCs that gain access to the pregnant person's bloodstream, preventing these Rh+ cells from
     activating the primary antibody response. Without a primary anti-Rh factor antibody response, the next pregnancy
     with an Rh+ will have minimal risk of HDN. However, the person will need to be retreated with Rho(D) immune
     globulin during that pregnancy to prevent a primary anti-Rh antibody response that could threaten subsequent
     pregnancies.

     FIGURE 19.6 (a) When an Rh- person has an Rh+ fetus, fetal erythrocytes are introduced into the pregnant person's circulatory system
     before or during birth, leading to production of anti-Rh IgG antibodies. These antibodies remain in the female after birth and, during a
     pregnancy with a with a second Rh+ baby, they can cross the placenta and attach to fetal Rh+ erythrocytes. Complement-mediated
     hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes results in a lack of sufficient cells for proper oxygenation of the fetus. (b) HDN can be prevented by
     administering Rho(D) immune globulin during and after each pregnancy with an Rh+ fetus. The immune globulin binds fetal Rh+ RBCs that
     gain access to the pregnant person's bloodstream, preventing activation of a primary immune response.

  Kerry's primary care physician is not sure why Kerry seems to develop rashes after spending time in the sun, so
  she orders a urinalysis and basic blood tests. The results reveal that Kerry has proteinuria (abnormal protein
  levels in the urine), hemoglobinuria (excess hemoglobin in the urine), and a low hematocrit (RBC count). These
  tests suggest that Kerry is suffering from a mild bout of hemolytic anemia. The physician suspects that the
  problem might be autoimmune, so she refers Kerry to a rheumatologist for additional testing and diagnosis.

      · Rheumatologists specialize in musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and joint pain.

Type III Hypersensitivities

Type III hypersensitivities are immune-complex reactions that were first characterized by Nicolas Maurice Arthus
(1862-1945) in 1903. To produce antibodies for experimental procedures, Arthus immunized rabbits by injecting
them with serum from horses. However, while immunizing rabbits repeatedly with horse serum, Arthus noticed a
previously unreported and unexpected localized subcutaneous hemorrhage with edema at the site of injection. This
reaction developed within 3 to10 hours after injection. This localized reaction to non-self serum proteins was called
an Arthus reaction. An Arthus reaction occurs when soluble antigens bind with IgG in a ratio that results in the
accumulation of antigen-antibody aggregates called immune complexes.

A unique characteristic of type III hypersensitivity is antibody excess (primarily IgG), coupled with a relatively low
concentration of antigen, resulting in the formation of small immune complexes that deposit on the surface of the
epithelial cells lining the inner lumen of small blood vessels or on the surfaces of tissues (Figure 19.7). This immune
complex accumulation leads to a cascade of inflammatory events that include the following:

  1. IgG binding to antibody receptors on localized mast cells, resulting in mast-cell degranulation
  2. Complement activation with production of pro-inflammatory C3a and C5a (see Chemical Defenses)
  3. Increased blood-vessel permeability with chemotactic recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages

Because these immune complexes are not an optimal size and are deposited on cell surfaces, they cannot be
phagocytosed in the usual way by neutrophils and macrophages, which, in turn, are often described as "frustrated."
Although phagocytosis does not occur, neutrophil degranulation results in the release of lysosomal enzymes that
cause extracellular destruction of the immune complex, damaging localized cells in the process. Activation of
coagulation pathways also occurs, resulting in thrombi (blood clots) that occlude blood vessels and cause ischemia
that can lead to vascular necrosis and localized hemorrhage.

Systemic type III hypersensitivity (serum sickness) occurs when immune complexes deposit in various body sites,
resulting in a more generalized systemic inflammatory response. These immune complexes involve non-self
proteins such as antibodies produced in animals for artificial passive immunity (see Vaccines), certain drugs, or
microbial antigens that are continuously released over time during chronic infections (e.g., subacute bacterial
endocarditis, chronic viral hepatitis). The mechanisms of serum sickness are similar to those described in localized
type III hypersensitivity but involve widespread activation of mast cells, complement, neutrophils, and
macrophages, which causes tissue destruction in areas such as the kidneys, joints, and blood vessels. As a result of
tissue destruction, symptoms of serum sickness include chills, fever, rash, vasculitis, and arthritis. Development of
glomerulonephritis or hepatitis is also possible.

Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis can also involve
damaging type III hypersensitivity reactions when auto-antibodies form immune complexes with self antigens.
These conditions are discussed in Autoimmune Disorders.

     Diphtheria Antitoxin

     Antibacterial sera are much less commonly used now than in the past, having been replaced by toxoid vaccines.
     However, a diphtheria antitoxin produced in horses is one example of such a treatment that is still used in some
     parts of the world. Although it is not licensed by the FDA for use in the United States, diphtheria antitoxin can be
     used to treat cases of diphtheria, which are caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.8 The treatment
     is not without risks, however. Serum sickness can occur when the patient develops an immune response to non-self
     horse proteins. Immune complexes are formed between the horse proteins and circulating antibodies when the two
     exist in certain proportions. These immune complexes can deposit in organs, causing damage such as arthritis,
     nephritis, rash, and fever. Serum sickness is usually transient with no permanent damage unless the patient is
     chronically exposed to the antigen, which can then result in irreversible damage to body sites such as joints and
     kidneys. Over time, phagocytic cells such as macrophages are able to clear the horse serum antigens, which results
     in improvement of the patient's condition and a decrease in symptoms as the immune response dissipates.

Type IV Hypersensitivities

Type IV hypersensitivities are not mediated by antibodies like the other three types of hypersensitivities. Rather,
type IV hypersensitivities are regulated by T cells and involve the action of effector cells. These types of
hypersensitivities can be organized into three subcategories based on T-cell subtype, type of antigen, and the
resulting effector mechanism (Table 19.5).

In the first type IV subcategory, CD4 TH1-mediated reactions are described as delayed-type hypersensitivities
(DTH). The sensitization step involves the introduction of antigen into the skin and phagocytosis by local antigen
presenting cells (APCs). The APCs activate helper T cells, stimulating clonal proliferation and differentiation into
memory TH1 cells. Upon subsequent exposure to the antigen, these sensitized memory TH1 cells release cytokines
that activate macrophages, and activated macrophages are responsible for much of the tissue damage. Examples of
this TH1-mediated hypersensitivity are observed in tuberculin the Mantoux skin test and contact dermatitis, such
as occurs in latex allergy reactions.

In the second type IV subcategory, CD4 TH2-mediated reactions result in chronic asthma or chronic allergic rhinitis.
In these cases, the soluble antigen is first inhaled, resulting in eosinophil recruitment and activation with the release
of cytokines and inflammatory mediators.

In the third type IV subcategory, CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated reactions are associated with tissue
transplant rejection and contact dermatitis (Figure 19.8). For this form of cell-mediated hypersensitivity, APCs
process and present the antigen with MHC I to naïve CD8 T cells. When these naïve CD8 T cells are activated, they
proliferate and differentiate into CTLs. Activated TH1 cells can also enhance the activation of the CTLs. The activated
CTLs then target and induce granzyme-mediated apoptosis in cells presenting the same antigen with MHC I. These
target cells could be "self" cells that have absorbed the foreign antigen (such as with contact dermatitis due to
poison ivy), or they could be transplanted tissue cells displaying foreign antigen from the donor.

FIGURE 19.8 Exposure to hapten antigens in poison ivy can cause contact dermatitis, a type IV hypersensitivity. (a) The first exposure to
752  19 · Diseases of the Immune System

     poison ivy does not result in a reaction. However, sensitization stimulates helper T cells, leading to production of memory helper T cells that
     can become reactivated on future exposures. (b) Upon secondary exposure, the memory helper T cells become reactivated, producing
     inflammatory cytokines that stimulate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to induce an inflammatory lesion at the exposed site. This lesion,
     which will persist until the allergen is removed, can inflict significant tissue damage if it continues long enough.

     Using Delayed Hypersensitivity to Test for TB

     Austrian pediatrician Clemans von Pirquet (1874-1929) first described allergy mechanisms, including type III
     serum sickness.9 His interest led to the development of a test for tuberculosis (TB), using the tuberculin antigen,
     based on earlier work identifying the TB pathogen performed by Robert Koch. Pirquet's method involved
     scarification, which results in simultaneous multiple punctures, using a device with an array of needles to break the
     skin numerous times in a small area. The device Pirquet used was similar to the tine test device with four needles
     seen in Figure 19.9.

     The tips of all the needles in the array are coated with tuberculin, a protein extract of TB bacteria, effectively
     introducing the tuberculin into the skin. One to 3 days later, the area can be examined for a delayed hypersensitivity
     reaction, signs of which include swelling and redness.
     As you can imagine, scarification was not a pleasant experience,10 and the numerous skin punctures put the patient
     at risk of developing bacterial infection of the skin. Mantoux modified Pirquet's test to use a single subcutaneous
     injection of purified tuberculin material. A positive test, which is indicated by a delayed localized swelling at the
     injection site, does not necessarily mean that the patient is currently infected with active TB. Because type IV
     (delayed-type) hypersensitivity is mediated by reactivation of memory T cells, such cells may have been created
     recently (due to an active current infection) or years prior (if a patient had TB and had spontaneously cleared it, or if
     it had gone into latency). However, the test can be used to confirm infection in cases in which symptoms in the
     patient or findings on a radiograph suggest its presence.

Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis

Some disease caused by hypersensitivities are not caused exclusively by one type. For example, hypersensitivity
pneumonitis (HP), which is often an occupational or environmental disease, occurs when the lungs become
inflamed due to an allergic reaction to inhaled dust, endospores, bird feathers, bird droppings, molds, or chemicals.
HP goes by many different names associated with various forms of exposure (Figure 19.10). HP associated with bird
droppings is sometimes called pigeon fancier's lung or poultry worker's lung--both common in bird breeders and
handlers. Cheese handler's disease, farmer's lung, sauna takers' disease, and hot-tub lung are other names for HP
associated with exposure to molds in various environments.
Pathology associated with HP can be due to both type III (mediated by immune complexes) and type IV (mediated
by TH1 cells and macrophages) hypersensitivities. Repeated exposure to allergens can cause alveolitis due to the
formation of immune complexes in the alveolar wall of the lung accompanied by fluid accumulation, and the
formation of granulomas and other lesions in the lung as a result of TH1-mediated macrophage activation. Alveolitis
with fluid and granuloma formation results in poor oxygen perfusion in the alveoli, which, in turn, can cause
symptoms such as coughing, dyspnea, chills, fever, sweating, myalgias, headache, and nausea. Symptoms may
occur as quickly as 2 hours after exposure and can persist for weeks if left untreated.

daily to large numbers of birds may be susceptible to poultry worker's lung. (b) Workers in a cheese factory may become sensitized to

     FIGURE 19.11 Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivities. Notice that types I-III are B-cell/antibody-
     mediated hypersensitivities, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T-cell phenomenon.

     Diagnosis of Hypersensitivities

     Diagnosis of type I hypersensitivities is a complex process requiring several diagnostic tests in addition to a well-
     documented patient history. Serum IgE levels can be measured, but elevated IgE alone does not confirm allergic
     disease. As part of the process to identify the antigens responsible for a type I reaction allergy, testing through a
     prick puncture skin test (PPST) or an intradermal test can be performed. PPST is carried out with the introduction of
     allergens in a series of superficial skin pricks on the patient's back or arms (Figure 19.12). PPSTs are considered to
     be the most convenient and least expensive way to diagnose allergies, according to the US Joint Council of Allergy
     and the European Academy of Allergy and Immunology. The second type of testing, the intradermal test, requires
     injection into the dermis with a small needle. This needle, also known as a tuberculin needle, is attached to a syringe
     containing a small amount of allergen. Both the PPST and the intradermal tests are observed for 15-20 minutes for
     a wheal-flare reaction to the allergens. Measurement of any wheal (a raised, itchy bump) and flare (redness) within
     minutes indicates a type I hypersensitivity, and the larger the wheal-flare reaction, the greater the patient's
     sensitivity to the allergen.
     Type III hypersensitivities can often be misdiagnosed because of their nonspecific inflammatory nature. The
     symptoms are easily visible, but they may be associated with any of a number of other diseases. A strong,
     comprehensive patient history is crucial to proper and accurate diagnosis. Tests used to establish the diagnosis of
     hypersensitivity pneumonitis (resulting from type III hypersensitivity) include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL),
     pulmonary function tests, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

Treatments of Hypersensitivities

Allergic reactions can be treated in various ways. Prevention of allergic reactions can be achieved by
desensitization (hyposensitization) therapy, which can be used to reduce the hypersensitivity reaction through
repeated injections of allergens. Extremely dilute concentrations of known allergens (determined from the allergen
tests) are injected into the patient at prescribed intervals (e.g., weekly). The quantity of allergen delivered by the
shots is slowly increased over a buildup period until an effective dose is determined and that dose is maintained for
the duration of treatment, which can last years. Patients are usually encouraged to remain in the doctor's office for
30 minutes after receiving the injection in case the allergens administered cause a severe systemic reaction.
Doctors' offices that administer desensitization therapy must be prepared to provide resuscitation and drug
treatment in the case of such an event.

Desensitization therapy is used for insect sting allergies and environmental allergies. The allergy shots elicit the
production of different interleukins and IgG antibody responses instead of IgE. When excess allergen-specific IgG
antibodies are produced and bind to the allergen, they can act as blocking antibodies to neutralize the allergen
before it can bind IgE on mast cells. There are early studies using oral therapy for desensitization of food allergies
that are promising.11 12 These studies involve feeding children who have allergies tiny amounts of the allergen (e.g.,
peanut flour) or related proteins over time. Many of the subjects show reduced severity of reaction to the food
allergen after the therapy.

There are also therapies designed to treat severe allergic reactions. Emergency systemic anaphylaxis is treated
initially with an epinephrine injection, which can counteract the drop in blood pressure. Individuals with known
severe allergies often carry a self-administering auto-injector that can be used in case of exposure to the allergen
(e.g., an insect sting or accidental ingestion of a food that causes a severe reaction). By self-administering an

     epinephrine shot (or sometimes two), the patient can stem the reaction long enough to seek medical attention.
     Follow-up treatment generally involves giving the patient antihistamines and slow-acting corticosteroids for several
     days after the reaction to prevent potential late-phase reactions. However, the effects of antihistamine and
     corticosteroid treatment are not well studied and are used based on theoretical considerations.

     Treatment of milder allergic reactions typically involves antihistamines and other anti-inflammatory drugs. A variety
     of antihistamine drugs are available, in both prescription and over-the-counter strengths. There are also
     antileukotriene and antiprostaglandin drugs that can be used in tandem with antihistamine drugs in a combined
     (and more effective) therapy regime.

     Treatments of type III hypersensitivities include preventing further exposure to the antigen and the use of anti-
     inflammatory drugs. Some conditions can be resolved when exposure to the antigen is prevented. Anti-
     inflammatory corticosteroid inhalers can also be used to diminish inflammation to allow lung lesions to heal.
     Systemic corticosteroid treatment, oral or intravenous, is also common for type III hypersensitivities affecting body
     systems. Treatment of hypersensitivity pneumonitis includes avoiding the allergen, along with the possible addition
     of prescription steroids such as prednisone to reduce inflammation.

     Treatment of type IV hypersensitivities includes antihistamines, anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and, if
     possible, eliminating further exposure to the antigen.

     19.2 Autoimmune Disorders

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain why autoimmune disorders develop
         · Provide a few examples of organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases

     In 1970, artist Walt Kelly developed a poster promoting Earth Day, featuring a character from Pogo, his daily
     newspaper comic strip. In the poster, Pogo looks out across a litter-strewn forest and says wryly, "We have met the
     enemy and he is us." Pogo was not talking about the human immune system, but he very well could have been.
     Although the immune system protects the body by attacking invading "enemies" (pathogens), in some cases, the
     immune system can mistakenly identify the body's own cells as the enemy, resulting in autoimmune disease.

     Autoimmune diseases are those in which the body is attacked by its own specific adaptive immune response. In
     normal, healthy states, the immune system induces tolerance, which is a lack of an anti-self immune response.
     However, with autoimmunity, there is a loss of immune tolerance, and the mechanisms responsible for autoimmune
     diseases include type II, III, and IV hypersensitivity reactions. Autoimmune diseases can have a variety of mixed
     symptoms that flare up and disappear, making diagnosis difficult.

     The causes of autoimmune disease are a combination of the individual's genetic makeup and the effect of
     environmental influences, such as sunlight, infections, medications, and environmental chemicals. However, the
     vagueness of this list reflects our poor understanding of the etiology of these diseases. Except in a very few specific
     diseases, the initiation event(s) of most autoimmune states has not been fully characterized.

     There are several possible causes for the origin of autoimmune diseases and autoimmunity is likely due to several
     factors. Evidence now suggests that regulatory T and B cells play an essential role in the maintenance of tolerance
     and prevention of autoimmune responses. The regulatory T cells are especially important for inhibiting autoreactive
     T cells that are not eliminated during thymic selection and escape the thymus (see T Lymphocytes and Cellular
     Immunity). In addition, antigen mimicry between pathogen antigens and our own self antigens can lead to cross-
     reactivity and autoimmunity. Hidden self-antigens may become exposed because of trauma, drug interactions, or
     disease states, and trigger an autoimmune response. All of these factors could contribute to autoimmunity.
     Ultimately, damage to tissues and organs in the autoimmune disease state comes as a result of inflammatory

responses that are inappropriate; therefore, treatment often includes immunosuppressive drugs and
corticosteroids.

Organ-Specific Autoimmune Diseases

Some autoimmune diseases are considered organ specific, meaning that the immune system targets specific organs
or tissues. Examples of organ-specific autoimmune diseases include celiac disease, Graves disease, Hashimoto
thyroiditis, type I diabetes mellitus, and Addison disease.

Celiac Disease
Celiac disease is largely a disease of the small intestine, although other organs may be affected. People in their 30s
and 40s, and children are most commonly affected, but celiac disease can begin at any age. It results from a
reaction to proteins, commonly called gluten, found mainly in wheat, barley, rye, and some other grains. The disease
has several genetic causes (predispositions) and poorly understood environmental influences. On exposure to
gluten, the body produces various autoantibodies and an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response in the
small intestine leads to a reduction in the depth of the microvilli of the mucosa, which hinders absorption and can
lead to weight loss and anemia. The disease is also characterized by diarrhea and abdominal pain, symptoms that
are often misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.

Diagnosis of celiac disease is accomplished from serological tests for the presence of primarily IgA antibodies to
components of gluten, the transglutinaminase enzyme, and autoantibodies to endomysium, a connective tissue
surrounding muscle fibers. Serological tests are typically followed up with endoscopy and biopsy of the duodenal
mucosa. Serological screening surveys have found about 1% of individuals in the United Kingdom are positive even
though they do not all display symptoms.13 This early recognition allows for more careful monitoring and prevention
of severe disease.

Celiac disease is treated with complete removal of gluten-containing foods from the diet, which results in improved
symptoms and reduced risk of complications. Other theoretical approaches include breeding grains that do not
contain the immunologically reactive components or developing dietary supplements that contain enzymes that
break down the protein components that cause the immune response.14

Disorders of the Thyroid
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Symptoms of Graves disease
result from the production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) also called TSH-receptor antibody. TSI
targets and binds to the receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is naturally produced by the pituitary
gland. TSI may cause conflicting symptoms because it may stimulate the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone
or block thyroid hormone production entirely, making diagnosis more difficult. Signs and symptoms of Graves
disease include heat intolerance, rapid and irregular heartbeat, weight loss, goiter (a swollen thyroid gland,
protruding under the skin of the throat [Figure 19.13]) and exophthalmia (bulging eyes) often referred to as Graves
ophthalmopathy (Figure 19.14).

The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is Hashimoto thyroiditis, also called chronic
lymphocytic thyroiditis. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis often develop a spectrum of different diseases because
they are more likely to develop additional autoimmune diseases such as Addison disease (discussed later in this
section), type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease. Hashimoto thyroiditis is a TH1 cell-mediated
disease that occurs when the thyroid gland is attacked by cytotoxic lymphocytes, macrophages, and autoantibodies.
This autoimmune response leads to numerous symptoms that include goiter (Figure 19.13), cold intolerance,
muscle weakness, painful and stiff joints, depression, and memory loss.

     Type 1 Diabetes
     Juvenile diabetes, or type 1 diabetes mellitus, is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. It is a T-cell-
     dependent autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of the  cells of the islets of Langerhans
     in the pancreas by CD4 TH1-mediated CD8 T cells, anti--cell antibodies, and macrophage activity. There is also
     evidence that viral infections can have either a potentiating or inhibitory role in the development of type 1 diabetes
     (T1D) mellitus. The destruction of the  cells causes a lack of insulin production by the pancreas. In T1D, -cell
     destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of hyperglycemia, extreme increase in thirst and
     urination, weight loss, and extreme fatigue usually have a sudden onset, and diagnosis usually does not occur until
     most  cells have already been destroyed.

     Autoimmune Addison Disease
     Destruction of the adrenal glands (the glands lying above the kidneys that produce glucocorticoids,
     mineralocorticoids, and sex steroids) is the cause of Addison disease, also called primary adrenal insufficiency
     (PAI). Today, up to 80% of Addison disease cases are diagnosed as autoimmune Addison disease (AAD), which is
     caused by an autoimmune response to adrenal tissues disrupting adrenal function. Disruption of adrenal function
     causes impaired metabolic processes that require normal steroid hormone levels, causing signs and symptoms
     throughout the body. There is evidence that both humoral and CD4 TH1-driven CD8 T-cell-mediated immune
     mechanisms are directed at the adrenal cortex in AAD. There is also evidence that the autoimmune response is
     associated with autoimmune destruction of other endocrine glands as well, such as the pancreas and thyroid,
     conditions collectively referred to as autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS). In up to 80% of patients with
     AAD, antibodies are produced to three enzymes involved in steroid synthesis: 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), 17-
     hydroxylase, and cholesterol side-chain-cleaving enzyme.15 The most common autoantibody found in AAD is to
     21-OH, and antibodies to any of the key enzymes for steroid production are diagnostic for AAD. The adrenal cortex
     cells are targeted, destroyed, and replaced with fibrous tissue by immune-mediated inflammation. In some
     patients, at least 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed before symptoms become diagnostic.

     Symptoms of AAD include weakness, nausea, decreased appetite, weight loss, hyperpigmentation (Figure 19.15),

hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium levels), hyponatremia (decreased blood sodium levels), hypoglycemia
(decreased levels of blood sugar), hypotension (decreased blood pressure), anemia, lymphocytosis (decreased
levels of white blood cells), and fatigue. Under extreme stress, such as surgery, accidental trauma, or infection,
patients with AAD may experience an adrenal crisis that causes the patient to vomit, experience abdominal pain,
back or leg cramps, and even severe hypotension leading to shock.

Systemic Autoimmune Diseases

Whereas organ-specific autoimmune diseases target specific organs or tissues, systemic autoimmune diseases are
more generalized, targeting multiple organs or tissues throughout the body. Examples of systemic autoimmune
diseases include multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus
erythematosus.

Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune central nervous system disease that affects the brain and spinal cord.
Lesions in multiple locations within the central nervous system are a hallmark of multiple sclerosis and are caused
by infiltration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier. The immune cells include T cells that promote
inflammation, demyelination, and neuron degeneration, all of which disrupt neuronal signaling. Symptoms of MS
include visual disturbances; muscle weakness; difficulty with coordination and balance; sensations such as
numbness, prickling, or "pins and needles"; and cognitive and memory problems.

Myasthenia Gravis
Autoantibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the synaptic cleft of neuromuscular junctions
lead to myasthenia gravis (Figure 19.16). Anti-AChR antibodies are high-affinity IgGs and their synthesis requires
activated CD4 T cells to interact with and stimulate B cells. Once produced, the anti-AChR antibodies affect
neuromuscular transmission by at least three mechanisms:

    · Complement binding and activation at the neuromuscular junction
    · Accelerated AChR endocytosis of molecules cross-linked by antibodies
    · Functional AChR blocking, which prevents normal acetylcholine attachment to, and activation of, AChR

Regardless of the mechanism, the effect of anti-AChR is extreme muscle weakness and potentially death through
respiratory arrest in severe cases.

     muscle contraction. (b) In myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies block the receptors for acetylcholine (AChr) on muscle cells, resulting in
     paralysis.

     Psoriasis
     Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales on elbows, knees,
     scalp, back, face, palms, feet, and sometimes other areas. Some individuals with psoriasis also get a form of
     arthritis called psoriatic arthritis, in which the joints can become inflamed. Psoriasis results from the complex
     interplay between keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells, and the cytokines produced by these various cells. In a
     process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in the skin rise to the surface. Normally, this process takes a
     month. In psoriasis, as a result of cytokine activation, cell turnover happens in just a few days. The thick inflamed
     patches of skin that are characteristic of psoriasis develop because the skin cells rise too fast.

     Rheumatoid Arthritis
     The most common chronic inflammatory joint disease is rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Figure 19.17) and it is still a
     major medical challenge because of unsolved questions related to the environmental and genetic causes of the
     disease. RA involves type III hypersensitivity reactions and the activation of CD4 T cells, resulting in chronic release
     of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-). The activated CD4 T cells also
     stimulate the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-
     CCP) that form immune complexes. Increased levels of acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), are
     also produced as part of the inflammatory process and participate in complement fixation with the antibodies on the
     immune complexes. The formation of immune complexes and reaction to the immune factors cause an
     inflammatory process in joints, particularly in the hands, feet, and legs. Diagnosis of RA is based on elevated levels
     of RF, anti-CCP, quantitative CRP, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (modified Westergren). In addition,
     radiographs, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging scans can identify joint damage, such as erosions, a loss of
     bone within the joint, and narrowing of joint space.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
The damage and pathology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is caused by type III hypersensitivity reactions.
Autoantibodies produced in SLE are directed against nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Anti-nuclear antibodies
(ANAs) are present in more than 95% of patients with SLE,16 with additional autoantibodies including anti-
double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) and anti-Sm antibodies (antibodies to small nuclear ribonucleoprotein). Anti-ds-
DNA and anti-Sm antibodies are unique to patients with SLE; thus, their presence is included in the classification
criteria of SLE. Cellular interaction with autoantibodies leads to nuclear and cellular destruction, with components
released after cell death leading to the formation of immune complexes.

Because autoantibodies in SLE can target a wide variety of cells, symptoms of SLE can occur in many body locations.
However, the most common symptoms include fatigue, fever with no other cause, hair loss, and a sunlight-sensitive
"butterfly" or wolf-mask (lupus) rash that is found in about 50% of people with SLE (Figure 19.18). The rash is most
often seen over the cheeks and bridge of the nose, but can be widespread. Other symptoms may appear depending
on affected areas. The joints may be affected, leading to arthritis of the fingers, hands, wrists, and knees. Effects on
the brain and nervous system can lead to headaches, numbness, tingling, seizures, vision problems, and personality
changes. There may also be abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, shortness of breath, and blood in the
sputum. Effects on the skin can lead to additional areas of skin lesions, and vasoconstriction can cause color
changes in the fingers when they are cold (Raynaud phenomenon). Effects on the kidneys can lead to edema in the
legs and weight gain. A diagnosis of SLE depends on identification of four of 11 of the most common symptoms and
confirmed production of an array of autoantibodies unique to SLE. A positive test for ANAs alone is not diagnostic.

19.3 Organ Transplantation and Rejection

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain why human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are important in tissue transplantation
    · Explain the types of grafts possible and their potential for interaction with the immune system
    · Describe what occurs during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

A graft is the transplantation of an organ or tissue to a different location, with the goal of replacing a missing or
damaged organ or tissue. Grafts are typically moved without their attachments to the circulatory system and must
reestablish these, in addition to the other connections and interactions with their new surrounding tissues. There
are different types of grafts depending on the source of the new tissue or organ. Tissues that are transplanted from
one genetically distinct individual to another within the same species are called allografts. An interesting variant of
764  19 · Diseases of the Immune System

     the allograft is an isograft, in which tissue from one twin is transplanted to another. As long as the twins are
     monozygotic (therefore, essentially genetically identical), the transplanted tissue is virtually never rejected. If
     tissues are transplanted from one area on an individual to another area on the same individual (e.g., a skin graft on a
     burn patient), it is known as an autograft. If tissues from an animal are transplanted into a human, this is called a
     xenograft.

     Transplant Rejection

     The different types of grafts described above have varying risks for rejection (Table 19.7). Rejection occurs when the
     recipient's immune system recognizes the donor tissue as foreign (non-self), triggering an immune response. The
     major histocompatibility complex markers MHC I and MHC II, more specifically identified as human leukocyte
     antigens (HLAs), play a role in transplant rejection. The HLAs expressed in tissue transplanted from a genetically
     different individual or species may be recognized as non-self molecules by the host's dendritic cells. If this occurs,
     the dendritic cells will process and present the foreign HLAs to the host's helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells,
     thereby activating them. Cytotoxic T cells then target and kill the grafted cells through the same mechanism they
     use to kill virus-infected cells; helper T cells may also release cytokines that activate macrophages to kill graft cells.

     Types of Tissue and Organ Grafts and Their Complications

     Graft                            Procedure  Complications

     Autograft From self to self                 No rejection concerns

     Isograft From identical twin to twin        Little concern of rejection

     Allograft From relative or nonrelative to individual Rejection possible

     Xenograft From animal to human              Rejection possible

     TABLE 19.7

     With the three highly polymorphic MHC I genes in humans (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) determining compatibility,
     each with many alleles segregating in a population, odds are extremely low that a randomly chosen donor will match
     a recipient's six-allele genotype (the two alleles at each locus are expressed codominantly). This is why a parent or a
     sibling may be the best donor in many situations--a genetic match between the MHC genes is much more likely and
     the organ is much less likely to be rejected.

     Although matching all of the MHC genes can lower the risk for rejection, there are a number of additional gene
     products that also play a role in stimulating responses against grafted tissue. Because of this, no non-self grafted
     tissue is likely to completely avoid rejection. However, the more similar the MHC gene match, the more likely the
     graft is to be tolerated for a longer time. Most transplant recipients, even those with tissues well matched to their
     MHC genes, require treatment with immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives. This can make them more
     vulnerable than the general population to complications from infectious diseases. It can also result in transplant-
     related malignancies because the body's normal defenses against cancer cells are being suppressed.

     Graft-versus-Host Disease

     A form of rejection called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) primarily occurs in recipients of bone marrow
     transplants and peripheral blood stem cells. GHVD presents a unique situation because the transplanted tissue is
     capable of producing immune cells; APCs in the donated bone marrow may recognize the host cells as non-self,

leading to activation of the donor cytotoxic T cells. Once activated, the donor's T cells attack the recipient cells,
causing acute GVHD.

Acute GVHD typically develops within weeks after a bone marrow transplant, causing tissue damage affecting the
skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and eyes. In addition, acute GVHD may also lead to a cytokine storm, an
unregulated secretion of cytokines that may be fatal. In addition to acute GVHD, there is also the risk for chronic
GVHD developing months after the bone marrow transplant. The mechanisms responsible for chronic GVHD are not
well understood.

To minimize the risk of GVHD, it is critically important to match the HLAs of the host and donor as closely as possible
in bone marrow transplants. In addition, the donated bone marrow is processed before grafting to remove as many
donor APCs and T cells as possible, leaving mostly hematopoietic stem cells.

The Future of Transplantation

Historically speaking, the practice of transplanting tissues--and the complications that can accompany such
procedures--is a relatively recent development. It was not until 1954 that the first successful organ transplantation
between two humans was achieved. Yet the field of organ transplantation has progressed rapidly since that time.

Nonetheless, the practice of transplanting non-self tissues may soon become obsolete. Scientists are now
attempting to develop methods by which new organs may be grown in vitro from an individual's own harvested cells
to replace damaged or abnormal ones. Because organs produced in this way would contain the individual's own
cells, they could be transplanted into the individual without risk for rejection.

An alternative approach that is gaining renewed research interest is genetic modification of donor animals, such as
pigs, to provide transplantable organs that do not elicit an immune response in the recipient. The approach involves
excising the genes in the pig (in the embryo) that are most responsible for the rejection reaction after
transplantation. Finding these genes and effectively removing them is a challenge, however. So too is identifying and
neutralizing risks from viral sequences that might be embedded in the pig genome, posing a risk for infection in the
human recipient.

CLINICAL FOCUS

Resolution

Kerry's tests come back positive, confirming a diagnosis of lupus, a disease that occurs 10 times more
frequently in females than males. SLE cannot be cured, but there are various therapies available for reducing
and managing its symptoms. Specific therapies are prescribed based on the particular symptoms presenting in
the patient. Kerry's rheumatologist starts her therapy with a low dose of corticosteroids to reduce her rashes.
She also prescribes a low dose of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-inflammatory drug that is used to treat
inflammation in patients with RA, childhood arthritis, SLE, and other autoimmune diseases. Although the
mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine is not well defined, it appears that this drug interferes with the
processes of antigen processing and activation of autoimmunity. Because of its mechanism, the effects of
hydroxychloroquine are not as immediate as that of other anti-inflammatory drugs, but it is still considered a
good companion therapy for SLE. Kerry's doctor also advises her to limit her exposure to sunlight, because
766  19 · Diseases of the Immune System

       photosensitivity to sunlight may precipitate rashes.

       Over the next 6 months, Kerry follows her treatment plan and her symptoms do not return. However, future
       flare-ups are likely to occur. She will need to continue her treatment for the rest of her life and seek medical
       attention whenever new symptoms develop.

     19.4 Immunodeficiency

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Compare the causes of primary and secondary immunodeficiencies
         · Describe treatments for primary and secondary immunodeficiencies

     Immunodeficiencies are inherited (primary) or acquired (secondary) disorders in which elements of host immune
     defenses are either absent or functionally defective. In developed countries, most immunodeficiencies are
     inherited, and they are usually first seen in the clinic as recurrent or overwhelming infections in infants. However, on
     a global scale, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency and would be categorized as an
     acquired immunodeficiency. Acquired immunodeficiencies are more likely to develop later in life, and the
     pathogenic mechanisms of many remain obscure.

     Primary Immunodeficiency

     Primary immunodeficiencies, which number more than 250, are caused by inherited defects of either nonspecific
     innate or specific adaptive immune defenses. In general, patients born with primary immunodeficiency (PI)
     commonly have an increased susceptibility to infection. This susceptibility can become apparent shortly after birth
     or in early childhood for some individuals, whereas other patients develop symptoms later in life. Some primary
     immunodeficiencies are due to a defect of a single cellular or humoral component of the immune system; others
     may result from defects of more than one component. Examples of primary immunodeficiencies include chronic
     granulomatous disease, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, selective IgA deficiency, and severe combined
     immunodeficiency disease.

     Chronic Granulomatous Disease
     The causes of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are defects in the NADPH oxidase system of phagocytic cells,
     including neutrophils and macrophages, that prevent the production of superoxide radicals in phagolysosomes. The
     inability to produce superoxide radicals impairs the antibacterial activity of phagocytes. As a result, infections in
     patients with CGD persist longer, leading to a chronic local inflammation called a granuloma. Microorganisms that
     are the most common causes of infections in patients with CGD include Aspergillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus,
     Chromobacterium violaceum, Serratia marcescens, and Salmonella typhimurium.

     X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia
     Deficiencies in B cells due to defective differentiation lead to a lack of specific antibody production known as X-
     linked agammaglobulinemia. In 1952, Ogden C. Bruton (1908-2003) described the first immunodeficiency in a
     boy whose immune system failed to produce antibodies. This defect is inherited on the X chromosome and is
     characterized by the absence of immunoglobulin in the serum; it is called Bruton X-linked agammaglobulinemia
     (XLA). The defective gene, BTK, in XLA is now known to encode a tyrosine kinase called Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk).
     In patients whose B cells are unable to produce sufficient amounts of Btk, the B-cell maturation and differentiation
     halts at the pre-B-cell stage of growth. B-cell maturation and differentiation beyond the pre-B-cell stage of growth is
     required for immunoglobulin production. Patients who lack antibody production suffer from recurrent infections
     almost exclusively due to extracellular pathogens that cause pyogenic infections: Haemophilus influenzae,
     Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus. Because cell-mediated immunity is not impaired, these
     patients are not particularly vulnerable to infections caused by viruses or intracellular pathogens.

     Selective IgA Deficiency
     The most common inherited form of immunoglobulin deficiency is selective IgA deficiency, affecting about one in
     800 people. Individuals with selective IgA deficiency produce normal levels of IgG and IgM, but are not able to

     Access for free at openstax.org
19.4 · Immunodeficiency                                                                                                                  767

produce secretory IgA. IgA deficiency predisposes these individuals to lung and gastrointestinal infections for which
secretory IgA is normally an important defense mechanism. Infections in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract can
involve a variety of pathogens, including H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, S. aureus, Giardia
lamblia, or pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli.

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
Patients who suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) have B-cell and T-cell defects that impair T-
cell dependent antibody responses as well as cell-mediated immune responses. Patients with SCID also cannot
develop immunological memory, so vaccines provide them no protection, and live attenuated vaccines (e.g., for
varicella-zoster, measles virus, rotavirus, poliovirus) can actually cause the infection they are intended to prevent.
The most common form is X-linked SCID, which accounts for nearly 50% of all cases and occurs primarily in males.
Patients with SCID are typically diagnosed within the first few months of life after developing severe, often life-
threatening, opportunistic infection by Candida spp., Pneumocystis jirovecii, or pathogenic strains of E. coli.

Without treatment, babies with SCID do not typically survive infancy. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant may
successfully correct the defects in lymphocyte development that lead to the SCID phenotype, by replacing the
defective component. However, this treatment approach is not without risks, as demonstrated by the famous case
of David Vetter (1971-1984), better known as "Bubble Boy" (Figure 19.19). Vetter, a patient with SCID who lived in
a protective plastic bubble to prevent exposure to opportunistic microbes, received a bone marrow transplant from
his sister. Because of a latent Epstein-Barr virus infection in her bone marrow, however, he developed
mononucleosis and died of Burkitt lymphoma at the age of 12 years.

FIGURE 19.19 David Vetter, popularly known as "The Bubble Boy," was born with SCID and lived most of his life isolated inside a plastic
bubble. Here he is shown outside the bubble in a suit specially built for him by NASA. (credit: NASA Johnson Space Center)

    · What is the fundamental cause of a primary immunodeficiency?
    · Explain why patients with chronic granulomatous disease are especially susceptible to bacterial infections.
    · Explain why individuals with selective IgA deficiency are susceptible to respiratory and gastrointestinal

        infections.

Secondary Immunodeficiency

A secondary immunodeficiency occurs as a result an acquired impairment of function of B cells, T cells, or both.
Secondary immunodeficiencies can be caused by:

    · Systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, hepatitis, or HIV infection
    · Immunosuppressive treatments such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, bone marrow ablation before

        transplantation, or radiation therapy
768  19 · Diseases of the Immune System

         · Prolonged critical illness due to infection, surgery, or trauma in the very young, elderly, or hospitalized patients

     Unlike primary immunodeficiencies, which have a genetic basis, secondary immunodeficiencies are often reversible
     if the underlying cause is resolved. Patients with secondary immunodeficiencies develop an increased susceptibility
     to an otherwise benign infection by opportunistic pathogens such as Candida spp., P. jirovecii, and Cryptosporidium.

     HIV infection and the associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are the best-known secondary
     immunodeficiencies. AIDS is characterized by profound CD4 T-cell lymphopenia (decrease in lymphocytes). The
     decrease in CD4 T cells is the result of various mechanisms, including HIV-induced pyroptosis (a type of apoptosis
     that stimulates an inflammatory response), viral cytopathic effect, and cytotoxicity to HIV-infected cells.

     The most common cause of secondary immunodeficiency worldwide is severe malnutrition, which affects both
     innate and adaptive immunity. More research and information are needed for the more common causes of
     secondary immunodeficiency; however, the number of new discoveries in AIDS research far exceeds that of any
     other single cause of secondary immunodeficiency. AIDS research has paid off extremely well in terms of
     discoveries and treatments; increased research into the most common cause of immunodeficiency, malnutrition,
     would likely be as beneficial.

       CASE IN POINT

       An Immunocompromised Host

       Benjamin, a 50-year-old male patient who has been receiving chemotherapy to treat his chronic myelogenous
       leukemia (CML), a disease characterized by massive overproduction of nonfunctional, malignant myelocytic
       leukocytes that crowd out other, healthy leukocytes, is seen in the emergency department. He is complaining of
       a productive, wet cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. On examination, his pulse is 120 beats per minute (bpm) (normal
       range is 60-100 bpm) and weak, and his blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg (normal is 120/80 mm Hg). During
       auscultation, a distinct crackling can be heard in his lungs as he breathes, and his pulse-oximeter level (a
       measurement of blood-oxygen saturation) is 80% (normal is 95%-100%). He has a fever; his temperature is
       38.9 °C (102 °F). Sputum cultures and blood samples are obtained and sent to the lab, but Benjamin goes into
       respiratory distress and dies before the results can be obtained.

       Benjamin's death was a result of a combination of his immune system being compromised by his leukemia and
       his chemotherapy treatment further weakening his ability to mount an immune response. CML (and leukemia in
       general) and corresponding chemotherapy cause a decrease in the number of leukocytes capable of normal
       function, leading to secondary immunodeficiency. This increases the risk for opportunistic bacterial, viral,
       protozoal, and fungal infections that could include Staphylococcus, enteroviruses, Pneumocystis, Giardia, or
       Candida. Benjamin's symptoms were suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, but his leukemia and chemotherapy
       likely complicated and contributed to the severity of the pneumonia, resulting in his death. Because his
       leukemia was overproducing certain white blood cells, and those overproduced white blood cells were largely
       nonfunctional or abnormal in their function, he did not have the proper immune system blood cells to help him
       fight off the infection.

19.5 Cancer Immunobiology and Immunotherapy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Explain how the adaptive specific immune response responds to tumors
    · Discuss the risks and benefits of tumor vaccines

Cancer involves a loss of the ability of cells to control their cell cycle, the stages each eukaryotic cell goes through as
it grows and then divides. When this control is lost, the affected cells rapidly divide and often lose the ability to
differentiate into the cell type appropriate for their location in the body. In addition, they lose contact inhibition and
can start to grow on top of each other. This can result in formation of a tumor. It is important to make a distinction
here: The term "cancer" is used to describe the diseases resulting from loss of cell-cycle regulation and subsequent
cell proliferation. But the term "tumor" is more general. A "tumor" is an abnormal mass of cells, and a tumor can be
benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Traditional cancer treatment uses radiation and/or chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells; however, these
treatments can have unwanted side effects because they harm normal cells as well as cancer cells. Newer,
promising therapies attempt to enlist the patient's immune system to target cancer cells specifically. It is known
that the immune system can recognize and destroy cancerous cells, and some researchers and immunologists also
believe, based on the results of their experiments, that many cancers are eliminated by the body's own defenses
before they can become a health problem. This idea is not universally accepted by researchers, however, and needs
770  19 · Diseases of the Immune System

     further investigation for verification.

     Cell-Mediated Response to Tumors

     Cell-mediated immune responses can be directed against cancer cells, many of which do not have the normal
     complement of self-proteins, making them a target for elimination. Abnormal cancer cells may also present tumor
     antigens. These tumor antigens are not a part of the screening process used to eliminate lymphocytes during
     development; thus, even though they are self-antigens, they can stimulate and drive adaptive immune responses
     against abnormal cells.

     Presentation of tumor antigens can stimulate naïve helper T cells to become activated by cytokines such as IL-12
     and differentiate into TH1cells. TH1 cells release cytokines that can activate natural killer (NK) cells and enhance the
     killing of activated cytotoxic T cells. Both NK cells and cytotoxic T cells can recognize and target cancer cells, and
     induce apoptosis through the action of perforins and granzymes. In addition, activated cytotoxic T cells can bind to
     cell-surface proteins on abnormal cells and induce apoptosis by a second killing mechanism called the CD95 (Fas)
     cytotoxic pathway.

     Despite these mechanisms for removing cancerous cells from the body, cancer remains a common cause of death.
     Unfortunately, malignant tumors tend to actively suppress the immune response in various ways. In some cancers,
     the immune cells themselves are cancerous. In leukemia, lymphocytes that would normally facilitate the immune
     response become abnormal. In other cancers, the cancerous cells can become resistant to induction of apoptosis.
     This may occur through the expression of membrane proteins that shut off cytotoxic T cells or that induce regulatory
     T cells that can shut down immune responses.

     The mechanisms by which cancer cells alter immune responses are still not yet fully understood, and this is a very
     active area of research. As scientists' understanding of adaptive immunity improves, cancer therapies that harness
     the body's immune defenses may someday be more successful in treating and eliminating cancer.

     Cancer Vaccines

     There are two types of cancer vaccines: preventive and therapeutic. Preventive vaccines are used to prevent cancer
     from occurring, whereas therapeutic vaccines are used to treat patients with cancer. Most preventive cancer
     vaccines target viral infections that are known to lead to cancer. These include vaccines against human
     papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B, which help prevent cervical and liver cancer, respectively.

     Most therapeutic cancer vaccines are in the experimental stage. They exploit tumor-specific antigens to stimulate
     the immune system to selectively attack cancer cells. Specifically, they aim to enhance TH1 function and interaction
     with cytotoxic T cells, which, in turn, results in more effective attack on abnormal tumor cells. In some cases,
     researchers have used genetic engineering to develop antitumor vaccines in an approach similar to that used for
     DNA vaccines (see Micro Connections: DNA vaccines). The vaccine contains a recombinant plasmid with genes for
     tumor antigens; theoretically, the tumor gene would not induce new cancer because it is not functional, but it could
     trick the immune system into targeting the tumor gene product as a foreign invader.

     The first FDA-approved therapeutic cancer vaccine was sipuleucel-T (Provenge), approved in 2010 to treat certain
     cases of prostate cancer.17 This unconventional vaccine is custom designed using the patient's own cells. APCs are
     removed from the patient and cultured with a tumor-specific molecule; the cells are then returned to the patient.
     This approach appears to enhance the patient's immune response against the cancer cells. Another therapeutic
     cancer vaccine (talimogene laherparepvec, also called T-VEC or Imlygic) was approved by the FDA in 2015 for
     treatment of melanoma, a form of skin cancer. This vaccine contains a virus that is injected into tumors, where it
     infects and lyses the tumor cells. The virus also induces a response in lesions or tumors besides those into which
     the vaccine is injected, indicating that it is stimulating a more general (as opposed to local) antitumor immune
     response in the patient.

Using Viruses to Cure Cancer

Viruses typically destroy the cells they infect--a fact responsible for any number of human diseases. But the cell-
killing powers of viruses may yet prove to be the cure for some types of cancer, which is generally treated by
attempting to rid the body of cancerous cells. Several clinical trials are studying the effects of viruses targeted at
cancer cells. Reolysin, a drug currently in testing phases, uses reoviruses (respiratory enteric orphan viruses) that
can infect and kill cells that have an activated Ras-signaling pathway, a common mutation in cancerous cells.
Viruses such as rubeola (the measles virus) can also be genetically engineered to aggressively attack tumor cells.
These modified viruses not only bind more specifically to receptors overexpressed on cancer cells, they also carry
genes driven by promoters that are only turned on within cancer cells. Herpesvirus and others have also been
modified in this way.

INTRODUCTION Many laboratory tests are designed to confirm a presumptive diagnosis by detecting antibodies
specific to a suspected pathogen. Unfortunately, many such tests are time-consuming and expensive. That is now
changing, however, with the development of new, miniaturized technologies that are fast and inexpensive. For
example, researchers at Columbia University are developing a "lab-on-a-chip" technology that will test a single drop
of blood for 15 different infectious diseases, including HIV and syphilis, in a matter of minutes.1 The blood is pulled
through tiny capillaries into reaction chambers where the patient's antibodies mix with reagents. A chip reader that
attaches to a cell phone analyzes the results and sends them to the patient's healthcare provider. Currently the
device is being field tested in Rwanda to check pregnant people for chronic diseases. Researchers estimate that the
chip readers will sell for about $100 and individual chips for $1.2

       In an unfortunate incident, a healthcare worker struggling with addiction was caught stealing syringes of
       painkillers and replacing them with syringes filled with unknown substances. The hospital immediately fired the
       employee and had him arrested; however, two patients that he had worked with later tested positive for HIV.

       While there was no proof that the infections originated from the tainted syringes, the hospital's public health
       physician took immediate steps to determine whether any other patients had been put at risk. Although the
       worker had only been employed for a short time, it was determined that he had come into contact with more
       than 1300 patients. The hospital decided to contact all of these patients and have them tested for HIV.

     In addition to being crucial for our normal immune response, antibodies provide powerful tools for research and
     diagnostic purposes. The high specificity of antibodies makes them an excellent tool for detecting and quantifying a
     broad array of targets, from drugs to serum proteins to microorganisms. With in vitro assays, antibodies can be used
     to precipitate soluble antigens, agglutinate (clump) cells, opsonize and kill bacteria with the assistance of
     complement, and neutralize drugs, toxins, and viruses.

     An antibody's specificity results from the antigen-binding site formed within the variable regions--regions of the
     antibody that have unique patterns of amino acids that can only bind to target antigens with a molecular sequence
     that provides complementary charges and noncovalent bonds. There are limitations to antibody specificity, however.
     Some antigens are so chemically similar that cross-reactivity occurs; in other words, antibodies raised against one
     antigen bind to a chemically similar but different antigen. Consider an antigen that consists of a single protein with
     multiple epitopes (Figure 20.2). This single protein may stimulate the production of many different antibodies, some
     of which may bind to chemically identical epitopes on other proteins.

     Cross-reactivity is more likely to occur between antibodies and antigens that have low affinity or avidity. Affinity,
     which can be determined experimentally, is a measure of the binding strength between an antibody's binding site
     and an epitope, whereas avidity is the total strength of all the interactions in an antibody-antigen complex (which
     may have more than one bonding site). Avidity is influenced by affinity as well as the structural arrangements of the
     epitope and the variable regions of the antibody. If an antibody has a high affinity/avidity for a specific antigen, it is
     less likely to cross-react with an antigen for which it has a lower affinity/avidity.

    · What is cross-reactivity and why does it occur?

Producing Polyclonal Antibodies

Antibodies used for research and diagnostic purposes are often obtained by injecting a lab animal such as a rabbit or
a goat with a specific antigen. Within a few weeks, the animal's immune system will produce high levels of
antibodies specific for the antigen. These antibodies can be harvested in an antiserum, which is whole serum
collected from an animal following exposure to an antigen. Because most antigens are complex structures with
multiple epitopes, they result in the production of multiple antibodies in the lab animal. This so-called polyclonal
antibody response is also typical of the response to infection by the human immune system. Antiserum drawn from
an animal will thus contain antibodies from multiple clones of B cells, with each B cell responding to a specific
epitope on the antigen (Figure 20.3).

Lab animals are usually injected at least twice with antigen when being used to produce antiserum. The second
injection will activate memory cells that make class IgG antibodies against the antigen. The memory cells also
undergo affinity maturation, resulting in a pool of antibodies with higher average affinity. Affinity maturation occurs
because of mutations in the immunoglobulin gene variable regions, resulting in B cells with slightly altered antigen-
binding sites. On re-exposure to the antigen, those B cells capable of producing antibody with higher affinity
antigen-binding sites will be stimulated to proliferate and produce more antibody than their lower-affinity peers. An
adjuvant, which is a chemical that provokes a generalized activation of the immune system that stimulates greater
antibody production, is often mixed with the antigen prior to injection.

Antiserum obtained from animals will not only contain antibodies against the antigen artificially introduced in the
laboratory, but it will also contain antibodies to any other antigens to which the animal has been exposed during its
lifetime. For this reason, antisera must first be "purified" to remove other antibodies before using the antibodies for
research or diagnostic assays.

                FIGURE 20.3 This diagram illustrates the process for harvesting polyclonal antibodies produced in response to an antigen.

     Clinical Uses of Polyclonal Antisera

     Polyclonal antisera are used in many clinical tests that are designed to determine whether a patient is producing
     antibodies in response to a particular pathogen. While these tests are certainly powerful diagnostic tools, they have
     their limitations, because they are an indirect means of determining whether a particular pathogen is present. Tests
     based on a polyclonal response can sometimes lead to a false-positive result--in other words, a test that confirms
     the presence of an antigen that is, in fact, not present. Antibody-based tests can also result in a false-negative
     result, which occurs when the test fails to detect an antibody that is, in fact, present.

     The accuracy of antibody tests can be described in terms of test sensitivity and test specificity. Test sensitivity is
     the probability of getting a positive test result when the patient is indeed infected. If a test has high sensitivity, the
     probability of a false negative is low. Test specificity, on the other hand, is the probability of getting a negative test
     result when the patient is not infected. If a test has high specificity, the probability of a false positive is low.

     False positives often occur due to cross-reactivity, which can occur when epitopes from a different pathogen are
     similar to those found on the pathogen being tested for. For this reason, antibody-based tests are often used only as
     screening tests; if the results are positive, other confirmatory tests are used to make sure that the results were not a
     false positive.

     For example, a blood sample from a patient suspected of having hepatitis C can be screened for the virus using
     antibodies that bind to antigens on hepatitis C virus. If the patient is indeed infected with hepatitis C virus, the
     antibodies will bind to the antigens, yielding a positive test result. If the patient is not infected with hepatitic C virus,
     the antibodies will generally not bind to anything and the test should be negative; however, a false positive may
     occur if the patient has been previously infected by any of a variety of pathogens that elicit antibodies that cross-
     react with the hepatitis C virus antigens. Antibody tests for hepatitis C have high sensitivity (a low probability of a
     false negative) but low specificity (a high probability of a false positive). Thus, patients who test positive must have a
     second, confirmatory test to rule out the possibility of a false positive. The confirmatory test is a more expensive and
     time-consuming test that directly tests for the presence of hepatitis C viral RNA in the blood. Only after the
     confirmatory test comes back positive can the patient be definitively diagnosed with a hepatitis C infection.
     Antibody-based tests can result in a false negative if, for any reason, the patient's immune system has not produced
     detectable levels of antibodies. For some diseases, it may take several weeks following infection before the immune
     system produces enough antibodies to cross the detection threshold of the assay. In immunocompromised patients,
     the immune system may not be capable of producing a detectable level of antibodies.

Another limitation of using antibody production as an indicator of disease is that antibodies in the blood will persist
long after the infection has been cleared. Depending on the type of infection, antibodies will be present for many
months; sometimes, they may be present for the remainder of the patient's life. Thus, a positive antibody-based test
only means that the patient was infected at some point in time; it does not prove that the infection is active.

In addition to their role in diagnosis, polyclonal antisera can activate complement, detect the presence of bacteria in
clinical and food industry settings, and perform a wide array of precipitation reactions that can detect and quantify
serum proteins, viruses, or other antigens. However, with the many specificities of antibody present in a polyclonal
antiserum, there is a significant likelihood that the antiserum will cross-react with antigens to which the individual
was never exposed. Therefore, we must always account for the possibility of false-positive results when working
with a polyclonal antiserum.

Producing Monoclonal Antibodies

Some types of assays require better antibody specificity and affinity than can be obtained using a polyclonal
antiserum. To attain this high specificity, all of the antibodies must bind with high affinity to a single epitope. This
high specificity can be provided by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Table 20.1 compares some of the important
characteristics of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.

Unlike polyclonal antibodies, which are produced in live animals, monoclonal antibodies are produced in vitro using
tissue-culture techniques. mAbs are produced by immunizing an animal, often a mouse, multiple times with a
specific antigen. B cells from the spleen of the immunized animal are then removed. Since normal B cells are unable
to proliferate forever, they are fused with immortal, cancerous B cells called myeloma cells, to yield hybridoma
cells. All of the cells are then placed in a selective medium that allows only the hybridomas to grow; unfused
myeloma cells cannot grow, and any unfused B cells die off. The hybridomas, which are capable of growing
continuously in culture while producing antibodies, are then screened for the desired mAb. Those producing the
desired mAb are grown in tissue culture; the culture medium is harvested periodically and mAbs are purified from
the medium. This is a very expensive and time-consuming process. It may take weeks of culturing and many liters of
media to provide enough mAbs for an experiment or to treat a single patient. mAbs are expensive (Figure 20.4).

humanized monoclonal antibodies for human clinical use. Mouse antibodies cannot be injected repeatedly into
humans, because the immune system will recognize them as being foreign and will respond to them with
neutralizing antibodies. This problem can be minimized by genetically engineering the antibody in the mouse B cell.
The variable regions of the mouse light and heavy chain genes are ligated to human constant regions, and the
chimeric gene is then transferred into a host cell. This allows production of a mAb that is mostly "human" with only
the antigen-binding site being of mouse origin.

Humanized mAbs have been successfully used to treat cancer with minimal side effects. For example, the
humanized monoclonal antibody drug Herceptin has been helpful for the treatment of some types of breast cancer.
There have also been a few preliminary trials of humanized mAb for the treatment of infectious diseases, but none
of these treatments are currently in use. In some cases, mAbs have proven too specific to treat infectious diseases,
because they recognize some serovars of a pathogen but not others. Using a cocktail of multiple mAbs that target
different strains of the pathogen can address this problem. However, the great cost associated with mAb production
is another challenge that has prevented mAbs from becoming practical for use in treating microbial infections.3

One promising technology for inexpensive mAbs is the use of genetically engineered plants to produce antibodies
(or plantibodies). This technology transforms plant cells into antibody factories rather than relying on tissue culture
cells, which are expensive and technically demanding. In some cases, it may even be possible to deliver these
antibodies by having patients eat the plants rather than by extracting and injecting the antibodies. For example, in
2013, a research group cloned antibody genes into plants that had the ability to neutralize an important toxin from
bacteria that can cause severe gastrointestinal disease.4 Eating the plants could potentially deliver the antibodies
directly to the toxin.

Using Monoclonal Antibodies to Combat Ebola

During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a few Ebola-infected patients were treated with ZMapp, a
drug that had been shown to be effective in trials done in rhesus macaques only a few months before.5 ZMapp is a
combination of three mAbs produced by incorporating the antibody genes into tobacco plants using a viral vector. By
using three mAbs, the drug is effective across multiple strains of the virus. Unfortunately, there was only enough
ZMapp to treat a tiny number of patients.

While the current technology is not adequate for producing large quantities of ZMapp, it does show that
plantibodies--plant-produced mAbs--are feasible for clinical use, potentially cost effective, and worth further
development. The last several years have seen an explosion in the number of new mAb-based drugs for the
treatment of cancer and infectious diseases; however, the widespread use of such drugs is currently inhibited by
their exorbitant cost, especially in underdeveloped parts of the world, where a single dose might cost more than the
patient's lifetime income. Developing methods for cloning antibody genes into plants could reduce costs
dramatically.

     20.2 Detecting Antigen-Antibody Complexes

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe various types of assays used to find antigen-antibody complexes
         · Describe the circumstances under which antigen-antibody complexes precipitate out of solution
         · Explain how antibodies in patient serum can be used to diagnose disease

     Laboratory tests to detect antibodies and antigens outside of the body (e.g., in a test tube) are called in vitro assays.
     When both antibodies and their corresponding antigens are present in a solution, we can often observe a
     precipitation reaction in which large complexes (lattices) form and settle out of solution. In the next several
     sections, we will discuss several common in vitro assays.

     Precipitin Reactions

     A visible antigen-antibody complex is called a precipitin, and in vitro assays that produce a precipitin are called
     precipitin reactions. A precipitin reaction typically involves adding soluble antigens to a test tube containing a
     solution of antibodies. Each antibody has two arms, each of which can bind to an epitope. When an antibody binds
     to two antigens, the two antigens become bound together by the antibody. A lattice can form as antibodies bind
     more and more antigens together, resulting in a precipitin (Figure 20.5). Most precipitin tests use a polyclonal
     antiserum rather than monoclonal antibodies because polyclonal antibodies can bind to multiple epitopes, making
     lattice formation more likely. Although mAbs may bind some antigens, the binding will occur less often, making it
     much less likely that a visible precipitin will form.

     FIGURE 20.5 Polyclonal antiserum binds to multiple epitopes on an antigen, leading to lattice formation that results in a visible precipitin.
     Monoclonal antibodies can only bind to a single epitope; therefore, less binding occurs and lattice formation generally does not occur.

     The amount of precipitation also depends on several other factors. For example, precipitation is enhanced when the
     antibodies have a high affinity for the antigen. While most antibodies bind antigen with high affinity, even high-
     affinity binding uses relatively weak noncovalent bonds, so that individual interactions will often break and new
     interactions will occur.
     In addition, for precipitin formation to be visible, there must be an optimal ratio of antibody to antigen. The optimal
     ratio is not likely to be a 1:1 antigen-to-antibody ratio; it can vary dramatically, depending on the number of epitopes
     on the antigen and the class of antibody. Some antigens may have only one or two epitopes recognized by the
     antiserum, whereas other antigens may have many different epitopes and/or multiple instances of the same epitope
     on a single antigen molecule.
     Figure 20.6 illustrates how the ratio of antigen and antibody affects the amount of precipitation. To achieve the
     optimal ratio, antigen is slowly added to a solution containing antibodies, and the amount of precipitin is determined
     qualitatively. Initially, there is not enough antigen to produce visible lattice formation; this is called the zone of
     antibody excess. As more antigen is added, the reaction enters the equivalence zone (or zone of equivalence),
     where both the optimal antigen-antibody interaction and maximal precipitation occur. If even more antigen were
     added, the amount of antigen would become excessive and actually cause the amount of precipitation to decline.

FIGURE 20.6 As antigen is slowly added to a solution containing a constant amount antibody, the amount of precipitin increases as the

    · What is a precipitin?
    · Why do polyclonal antisera produce a better precipitin reaction?

Precipitin Ring Test
A variety of techniques allow us to use precipitin formation to quantify either antigen concentration or the amount of
antibody present in an antiserum. One such technique is the precipitin ring test (Figure 20.7), which is used to
determine the relative amount of antigen-specific antibody in a sample of serum. To perform this test, a set of test
tubes is prepared by adding an antigen solution to the bottom of each tube. Each tube receives the same volume of
solution, and the concentration of antigens is constant (e.g., 1 mg/mL). Next, glycerol is added to the antigen
solution in each test tube, followed by a serial dilution of the antiserum. The glycerol prevents mixing of the
antiserum with the antigen solution, allowing antigen-antibody binding to take place only at the interface of the two
solutions. The result is a visible ring of precipitin in the tubes that have an antigen-antibody ratio within the
equivalence zone. This highest dilution with a visible ring is used to determine the titer of the antibodies. The titer is
the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing a positive result, expressed as a whole number. In Figure 20.7, the
titer is 16.

While a measurement of titer does not tell us in absolute terms how much antibody is present, it does give a
measure of biological activity, which is often more important than absolute amount. In this example, it would not be
useful to know what mass of IgG were present in the antiserum, because there are many different specificities of
antibody present; but it is important for us to know how much of the antibody activity in a patient's serum is directed
against the antigen of interest (e.g., a particular pathogen or allergen).
786  20 · Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response

     FIGURE 20.7 A precipitin ring test is performed using a standard antigen solution in the bottom of the tube and a serial dilution of
     antiserum in the top of the tube. Glycerol prevents the two solutions from mixing so that precipitation only occurs at the interface. A visible
     ring of precipitation is seen in the 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 dilutions, indicating that these concentrations are within the equivalence zone. Since
     1/16 is the highest dilution in which a precipitin is observed, the titer is the reciprocal, or 16.

     Ouchterlony Assay
     While the precipitin ring test provides insights into antibody-antigen interactions, it also has some drawbacks. It
     requires the use of large amounts of serum, and great care must be taken to avoid mixing the solutions and
     disrupting the ring. Performing a similar test in an agar gel matrix can minimize these problems. This type of assay is
     variously called double immunodiffusion or the Ouchterlony assay for Orjan Ouchterlony,6 who first described the
     technique in 1948.
     When agar is highly purified, it produces a clear, colorless gel. Holes are punched in the gel to form wells, and
     antigen and antisera are added to neighboring wells. Proteins are able to diffuse through the gel, and precipitin arcs
     form between the wells at the zone of equivalence. Because the precipitin lattice is too large to diffuse through the
     gel, the arcs are firmly locked in place and easy to see (Figure 20.8).
     Although there are now more sensitive and quantitative methods of detecting antibody-antigen interactions, the
     Ouchterlony test provides a rapid and qualitative way of determining whether an antiserum has antibodies against a
     particular antigen. The Ouchterlony test is particularly useful when looking for cross-reactivity. We can check an
     antiserum against a group of closely related antigens and see which combinations form precipitin arcs.

FIGURE 20.8 The Ouchterlony test places antigen (well A) and antisera (wells 1 through 5) in a gel. The antibodies and antigen diffuse
through the gel, causing a precipitin arc to form at the zone of equivalence. In this example, only the antiserum in well 1 contains antibodies
to the antigen. The resulting precipitin arc is stable because the lattice is too large to diffuse through the gel. (credit left: modification of

Radial Immunodiffusion Assay
The radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay is similar to the Ouchterlony assay but is used to precisely quantify antigen
concentration rather than to compare different antigens. In this assay, the antiserum is added to tempered agar
(liquid agar at slightly above 45 °C), which is poured into a small petri dish or onto a glass slide and allowed to cool.
Wells are cut in the cooled agar, and antigen is then added to the wells and allowed to diffuse. As the antigen and
antibody interact, they form a zone of precipitation. The square of the diameter of the zone of precipitation is
directly proportional to the concentration of antigen. By measuring the zones of precipitation produced by samples
of known concentration (see the outer ring of samples in Figure 20.9), we can prepare a standard curve for
determining the concentration of an unknown solution. The RID assay is a also useful test for determining the
concentration of many serum proteins such as the C3 and C4 complement proteins, among others.

FIGURE 20.9 In this radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay, an antiserum is mixed with the agar before it is cooled, and solutions containing
antigen are added to each well in increasing concentrations (wells 1-4). An antigen solution of an unknown concentration is added to well
5. The zones of precipitation are measured and plotted against a standard curve to determine the antigen concentration of the unknown
sample. (credit circles: modification of work by Kangwa M, Yelemane V, Polat AN, Gorrepati KD, Grasselli M, Fernández-Lahore M)

     Flocculation Assays
     A flocculation assay is similar to a precipitin reaction except that it involves insoluble antigens such as lipids. A
     flocculant is similar to a precipitin in that there is a visible lattice of antigen and antibody, but because lipids are
     insoluble in aqueous solution, they cannot precipitate. Instead of precipitation, flocculation (foaming) is observed in
     the test tube fluid.

     Using Flocculation to Test for Syphilis

     Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause severe, chronic disease in adults. In addition, it is readily
     passed from infected people to their newborns during pregnancy and childbirth, often resulting in stillbirth or
     serious long-term health problems for the infant. Unfortunately, syphilis can also be difficult to diagnose in people,
     because it is often asymptomatic, especially in females. In addition, the causative agent, the bacterium Treponema
     pallidum, is both difficult to grow on conventional lab media and too small to see using routine microcopy. For these
     reasons, presumptive diagnoses of syphilis are generally confirmed indirectly in the laboratory using tests that
     detect antibodies to treponemal antigens.

     In 1906, German scientist August von Wassermann (1866-1925) introduced the first test for syphilis that relied on
     detecting anti-treponemal antibodies in the patient's blood. The antibodies detected in the Wassermann test were
     antiphospholipid antibodies that are nonspecific to T. pallidum. Their presence can assist in the diagnosis of syphilis,
     but because they are nonspecific, they can also lead to false-positive results in patients with other diseases and
     autoimmune conditions. The original Wasserman test has been modified over the years to minimize false-positives
     and is now known as the Venereal Disease Research Lab test, better known by its acronym, the VDRL test.

     To perform the VDRL test, patient serum or cerebral spinal fluid is placed on a slide with a mixture of cardiolipin (an
     antigenic phospholipid found in the mitochondrial membrane of various pathogens), lecithin, and cholesterol. The
     lecithin and cholesterol stabilize the reaction and diminish false positives. Anti-treponemal antibodies from an
     infected patient's serum will bind cardiolipin and form a flocculant. Although the VDRL test is more specific than the
     original Wassermann assay, false positives may still occur in patients with autoimmune diseases that cause
     extensive cell damage (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus).

     Neutralization Assay

     To cause infection, viruses must bind to receptors on host cells. Antiviral antibodies can neutralize viral infections by
     coating the virions, blocking the binding (Figure 18.7). This activity neutralizes virions and can result in the formation
     of large antibody-virus complexes (which are readily removed by phagocytosis) or by antibody binding to the virus
     and blocking its binding to host cell receptors. This neutralization activity is the basis of neutralization assays,
     sensitive assays used for diagnoses of viral infections.

     When viruses infect cells, they often cause damage (cytopathic effects) that may include lysis of the host cells.
     Cytopathic effects can be visualized by growing host cells in a petri dish, covering the cells with a thin layer of agar,
     and then adding virus (see Isolation, Culture, and Identification of Viruses). The virus will diffuse very slowly through
     the agar. A virus will enter a host cell, proliferate (causing cell damage), be released from the dead host cell, and
     then move to neighboring cells. As more and more cells die, plaques of dead cells will form (Figure 20.10).

     During the course of a viral infection, the patient will mount an antibody response to the virus, and we can quantify
     those antibodies using a plaque reduction assay. To perform the assay, a serial dilution is carried out on a serum
     sample. Each dilution is then mixed with a standardized amount of the suspect virus. Any virus-specific antibodies in
     the serum will neutralize some of the virus. The suspensions are then added to host cells in culture to allow any

nonneutralized virus to infect the cells and form plaques after several days. The titer is defined as the reciprocal of
the highest dilution showing a 50% reduction in plaques. Titer is always expressed as a whole number. For example,
if a 1/64 dilution was the highest dilution to show 50% plaque reduction, then the titer is 64.

The presence of antibodies in the patient's serum does not tell us whether the patient is currently infected or was
infected in the past. Current infections can be identified by waiting two weeks and testing another serum sample. A
four-fold increase in neutralizing titer in this second sample indicates a new infection.

FIGURE 20.10 In a neutralization assay, antibodies in patient serum neutralize viruses added to the wells, preventing the formation of
plaques. In the assay pictured, the wells with numerous plaques (white patches) contain a low concentration of antibodies. The wells with
relatively few plaques have a high concentration of antibodies. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Immunoelectrophoresis

When a patient has elevated protein levels in the blood or is losing protein in the urine, a clinician will often order a
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) assay (see Visualizing and Characterizing DNA, RNA, and Protein). This
assay compares the relative abundance of the various types of serum proteins. Abnormal protein electrophoresis
patterns can be further studied using immunoelectrophoresis (IEP). The IEP begins by running a PAGE. Antisera
against selected serum proteins are added to troughs running parallel to the electrophoresis track, forming
precipitin arcs similar to those seen in an Ouchterlony assay (Figure 20.11). This allows the identification of
abnormal immunoglobulin proteins in the sample.

IEP is particularly useful in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a cancer of antibody-secreting cells. Patients with
multiple myeloma cannot produce healthy antibodies; instead they produce abnormal antibodies that are
monoclonal proteins (M proteins). Thus, patients with multiple myeloma will present with elevated serum protein
levels that show a distinct band in the gamma globulin region of a protein electrophoresis gel and a sharp spike (in M
protein) on the densitometer scan rather than the normal broad smear (Figure 20.12). When antibodies against the
various types of antibody heavy and light chains are used to form precipitin arcs, the M protein will cause distinctly
skewed arcs against one class of heavy chain and one class of light chain as seen in Figure 20.11.

     Protein Electrophoresis and the Characterization of Immunoglobulin Structure

     The advent of electrophoresis ultimately led to researching and understanding the structure of antibodies. When
     Swedish biochemist Arne Tiselius (1902-1971) published the first protein electrophoresis results in 1937,7 he
     could identify the protein albumin (the smallest and most abundant serum protein) by the sharp band it produced in
     the gel. The other serum proteins could not be resolved in a simple protein electrophoresis, so he named the three
     broad bands, with many proteins in each band, alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. Two years later, American
     immunologist Elvin Kabat (1914-2000) traveled to Sweden to work with Tiselius using this new technique and
     showed that antibodies migrated as gamma globulins.8 With this new understanding in hand, researchers soon
     learned that multiple myeloma, because it is a cancer of antibody-secreting cells, could be tentatively diagnosed by
     the presence of a large M spike in the gamma-globulin region by protein electrophoresis. Prior to this discovery,
     studies on immunoglobulin structure had been minimal, because of the difficulty of obtaining pure samples to study.
     Sera from multiple myeloma patients proved to be an excellent source of highly enriched monoclonal
     immunoglobulin, providing the raw material for studies over the next 20-plus years that resulted in the elucidation
     of the structure of immunoglobulin.

     each band is quantified by densitometry, the data produce the bar graph on the right. Both gels show the expected dense band of albumin

Immunoblot Assay: The Western Blot

After performing protein gel electrophoresis, specific proteins can be identified in the gel using antibodies. This
technique is known as the western blot. Following separation of proteins by PAGE, the protein antigens in the gel
are transferred to and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane can then be exposed to a primary
antibody produced to specifically bind to the protein of interest. A second antibody equipped with a molecular
beacon will then bind to the first. These secondary antibodies are coupled to another molecule such as an enzyme
or a fluorophore (a molecule that fluoresces when excited by light). When using antibodies coupled to enzymes, a
chromogenic substrate for the enzyme is added. This substrate is usually colorless but will develop color in the
presence of the antibody. The fluorescence or substrate coloring identifies the location of the specific protein in the
membrane to which the antibodies are bound (Figure 20.13).

Typically, polyclonal antibodies are used for western blot assays. They are more sensitive than mAbs because of
their ability to bind to various epitopes of the primary antigen, and the signal from polyclonal antibodies is typically
stronger than that from mAbs. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used; however, they are much more expensive to
produce and are less sensitive, since they are only able to recognize one specific epitope.

Several variations of the western blot are useful in research. In a southwestern blot, proteins are separated by SDS-
PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, allowed to renature, and then probed with a fluorescently or
radioactively labeled DNA probe; the purpose of the southwestern is to identify specific DNA-protein interactions.
Far-western blots are carried out to determine protein-protein interactions between immobilized proteins
(separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and allowed to renature) and non-antibody
protein probes. The bound non-antibody proteins that interact with the immobilized proteins in a far-western blot
may be detected by radiolabeling, fluorescence, or the use of an antibody with an enzymatic molecular beacon.

Complement-Mediated Immunoassay

One of the key functions of antibodies is the activation (fixation) of complement. When antibody binds to bacteria,
for example, certain complement proteins recognize the bound antibody and activate the complement cascade. In
response, other complement proteins bind to the bacteria where some serve as opsonins to increase the efficiency
of phagocytosis and others create holes in gram-negative bacterial cell membranes, causing lysis. This lytic activity
can be used to detect the presence of antibodies against specific antigens in the serum.

Red blood cells are good indicator cells to use when evaluating complement-mediated cytolysis. Hemolysis of red
blood cells releases hemoglobin, which is a brightly colored pigment, and hemolysis of even a small number of red
cells will cause the solution to become noticeably pink (Figure 20.14). This characteristic plays a role in the
complement fixation test, which allows the detection of antibodies against specific pathogens. The complement
fixation test can be used to check for antibodies against pathogens that are difficult to culture in the lab such as
fungi, viruses, or the bacteria Chlamydia.

To perform the complement fixation test, antigen from a pathogen is added to patient serum. If antibodies to the
antigen are present, the antibody will bind the antigen and fix all the available complement. When red blood cells
and antibodies against red blood cells are subsequently added to the mix, there will be no complement left to lyse
the red cells. Thus, if the solution remains clear, the test is positive. If there are no antipathogen antibodies in the
patient's serum, the added antibodies will activate the complement to lyse the red cells, yielding a negative test
(Figure 20.14).

     FIGURE 20.14 The complement fixation test is used to determine whether a patient's serum contains antibodies to a specific antigen. If it

     added to the solution in the next step. If the sample does not contain antibodies to the antigen, hemolysis of the sheep blood cells will be
     observed.

    · Explain how blood types are determined
    · Explain the steps used to cross-match blood to be used in a transfusion

In addition to causing precipitation of soluble molecules and flocculation of molecules in suspension, antibodies can
also clump together cells or particles (e.g., antigen-coated latex beads) in a process called agglutination (Figure
796  20 · Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response

     18.9). Agglutination can be used as an indicator of the presence of antibodies against bacteria or red blood cells.
     Agglutination assays are usually quick and easy to perform on a glass slide or microtiter plate (Figure 20.15).
     Microtiter plates have an array of wells to hold small volumes of reagents and to observe reactions (e.g.,
     agglutination) either visually or using a specially designed spectrophotometer. The wells come in many different
     sizes for assays involving different volumes of reagents.

     Agglutination of Bacteria and Viruses

     The use of agglutination tests to identify streptococcal bacteria was developed in the 1920s by Rebecca Lancefield
     working with her colleagues A.R. Dochez and Oswald Avery.9 She used antibodies to identify M protein, a virulence
     factor on streptococci that is necessary for the bacteria's ability to cause strep throat. Production of antibodies
     against M protein is crucial in mounting a protective response against the bacteria.
     Lancefield used antisera to show that different strains of the same species of streptococci express different versions
     of M protein, which explains why children can come down with strep throat repeatedly. Lancefield classified beta-
     hemolytic streptococci into many groups based on antigenic differences in group-specific polysaccharides located in
     the bacterial cell wall. The strains are called serovars because they are differentiated using antisera. Identifying the
     serovars present in a disease outbreak is important because some serovars may cause more severe disease than
     others.
     The method developed by Lancefield is a direct agglutination assay, since the bacterial cells themselves
     agglutinate. A similar strategy is more commonly used today when identifying serovars of bacteria and viruses;
     however, to improve visualization of the agglutination, the antibodies may be attached to inert latex beads. This
     technique is called an indirect agglutination assay (or latex fixation assay), because the agglutination of the beads
     is a marker for antibody binding to some other antigen (Figure 20.16). Indirect assays can be used to detect the
     presence of either antibodies or specific antigens.

To identify antibodies in a patient's serum, the antigen of interest is attached to latex beads. When mixed with
patient serum, the antibodies will bind the antigen, cross-linking the latex beads and causing the beads to
agglutinate indirectly; this indicates the presence of the antibody (Figure 20.17). This technique is most often used
when looking for IgM antibodies, because their structure provides maximum cross-linking. One widely used
example of this assay is a test for rheumatoid factor (RF) to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. RF is, in fact,
the presence of IgM antibodies that bind to the patient's own IgG. RF will agglutinate IgG-coated latex beads.

In the reverse test, soluble antigens can be detected in a patient's serum by attaching specific antibodies
(commonly mAbs) to the latex beads and mixing this complex with the serum (Figure 20.17).

Agglutination tests are widely used in underdeveloped countries that may lack appropriate facilities for culturing
bacteria. For example, the Widal test, used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, looks for agglutination of Salmonella
enterica subspecies typhi in patient sera. The Widal test is rapid, inexpensive, and useful for monitoring the extent
of an outbreak; however, it is not as accurate as tests that involve culturing of the bacteria. The Widal test frequently
produces false positives in patients with previous infections with other subspecies of Salmonella, as well as false
negatives in patients with hyperproteinemia or immune deficiencies.

In addition, agglutination tests are limited by the fact that patients generally do not produce detectable levels of
antibody during the first week (or longer) of an infection. A patient is said to have undergone seroconversion when
antibody levels reach the threshold for detection. Typically, seroconversion coincides with the onset of signs and
symptoms of disease. However, in an HIV infection, for example, it generally takes 3 weeks for seroconversion to
take place, and in some instances, it may take much longer.

Similar to techniques for the precipitin ring test and plaque assays, it is routine to prepare serial two-fold dilutions of
the patient's serum and determine the titer of agglutinating antibody present. Since antibody levels change over
time in both primary and secondary immune responses, by checking samples over time, changes in antibody titer
can be detected. For example, a comparison of the titer during the acute phase of an infection versus the titer from
the convalescent phase will distinguish whether an infection is current or has occurred in the past. It is also possible
to monitor how well the patient's immune system is responding to the pathogen.

     Hemagglutination
     Agglutination of red blood cells is called hemagglutination. One common assay that uses hemagglutination is the
     direct Coombs' test, also called the direct antihuman globulin test (DAT), which generally looks for
     nonagglutinating antibodies. The test can also detect complement attached to red blood cells.
     The Coombs' test is often employed when a newborn has jaundice, yellowing of the skin caused by high blood
     concentrations of bilirubin, a product of the breakdown of hemoglobin in the blood. The Coombs' test is used to
     determine whether the child's red blood cells have been bound by antibodies during pregnancy. These antibodies
     would activate complement, leading to red blood cell lysis and the subsequent jaundice. Other conditions that can
     cause positive direct Coombs' tests include hemolytic transfusion reactions, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,

     Coombs' test may also be seen in some cancers and as an allergic reaction to some drugs (e.g., penicillin).
     The antibodies bound to red blood cells in these conditions are most often IgG, and because of the orientation of the
     antigen-binding sites on IgG and the comparatively large size of a red blood cell, it is unlikely that any visible
     agglutination will occur. However, the presence of IgG bound to red blood cells can be detected by adding Coombs'
     reagent, an antiserum containing antihuman IgG antibodies (that may be combined with anti-complement) (Figure
     20.18). The Coombs' reagent links the IgG attached to neighboring red blood cells and thus promotes agglutination.

antibodies against red blood cell antigens (other than the A and B antigens) that are unbound in a patient's serum

discussed below.

Antibodies that bind to red blood cells are not the only cause of hemagglutination. Some viruses also bind to red
blood cells, and this binding can cause agglutination when the viruses cross-link the red blood cells. For example,
influenza viruses have two different types of viral spikes called neuraminidase (N) and hemagglutinin (H), the latter
800  20 · Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response

     named for its ability to agglutinate red blood cells (see Viruses). Thus, we can use red blood cells to detect the
     presence of influenza virus by direct hemagglutination assays (HA), in which the virus causes visible agglutination
     of red blood cells. The mumps and rubella viruses can also be detected using HA.

     Most frequently, a serial dilution viral agglutination assay is used to measure the titer or estimate the amount of
     virus produced in cell culture or for vaccine production. A viral titer can be determined using a direct HA by making a
     serial dilution of the sample containing the virus, starting with a high concentration of sample that is then diluted in
     a series of wells. The highest dilution producing visible agglutination is the titer. The assay is carried out in a
     microtiter plate with V- or round-bottomed wells. In the presence of agglutinating viruses, the red blood cells and
     virus clump together and produce a diffuse mat over the bottom of the well. In the absence of virus, the red blood
     cells roll or sediment to the bottom of the well and form a dense pellet, which is why flat-bottomed wells cannot be
     used (Figure 20.19).

     A modification of the HA assay can be used to determine the titer of antiviral antibodies. The presence of these
     antibodies in a patient's serum or in a lab-produced antiserum will neutralize the virus and block it from
     agglutinating the red cells, making this a viral hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA). In this assay, patient serum
     is mixed with a standardized amount of virus. After a short incubation, a standardized amount of red blood cells is
     added and hemagglutination is observed. The titer of the patient's serum is the highest dilution that blocks
     agglutination (Figure 20.20).

     FIGURE 20.19 A viral suspension is mixed with a standardized amount of red blood cells. No agglutination of red blood cells is visible when
     the virus is absent, and the cells form a compact pellet at the bottom of the well. In the presence of virus, a diffuse pink precipitate forms in

  EYE ON ETHICS

  Animals in the Laboratory

  Much of what we know today about the human immune system has been learned through research conducted
  using animals--primarily, mammals--as models. Besides research, mammals are also used for the production of
  most of the antibodies and other immune system components needed for immunodiagnostics. Vaccines,
  diagnostics, therapies, and translational medicine in general have all been developed through research with
  animal models.

  Consider some of the common uses of laboratory animals for producing immune system components. Guinea
  pigs are used as a source of complement, and mice are the primary source of cells for making mAbs. These
  mAbs can be used in research and for therapeutic purposes. Antisera are raised in a variety of species, including
  horses, sheep, goats, and rabbits. When producing an antiserum, the animal will usually be injected at least
  twice, and adjuvants may be used to boost the antibody response. The larger animals used for making antisera
  will have blood harvested repeatedly over long periods of time, with little harm to the animals, but that is not
  usually the case for rabbits. Although we can obtain a few milliliters of blood from the ear veins of rabbits, we
  usually need larger volumes, which results in the deaths of the animals.

  We also use animals for the study of disease. The only way to grow Treponema pallidum for the study of syphilis
  is in living animals. Many viruses can be grown in cell culture, but growth in cell culture tells us very little about
802  20 · Laboratory Analysis of the Immune Response

     how the immune system will respond to the virus. When working on a newly discovered disease, we still employ
     Koch's postulates, which require causing disease in lab animals using pathogens from pure culture as a crucial
     step in proving that a particular microorganism is the cause of a disease. Studying the proliferation of bacteria
     and viruses in animal hosts, and how the host immune system responds, has been central to microbiological
     research for well over 100 years.

     While the practice of using laboratory animals is essential to scientific research and medical diagnostics, many
     people strongly object to the exploitation of animals for human benefit. This ethical argument is not a new
     one--indeed, one of Charles Darwin's daughters was an active antivivisectionist (vivisection is the practice of
     cutting or dissecting a live animal to study it). Most scientists acknowledge that there should be limits on the
     extent to which animals can be exploited for research purposes. Ethical considerations have led the National
     Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop strict regulations on the types of research that may be performed. These
     regulations also include guidelines for the humane treatment of lab animals, setting standards for their housing,
     care, and euthanization. The NIH document "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" makes it clear
     that the use of animals in research is a privilege granted by society to researchers.

     The NIH guidelines are based on the principle of the three R's: replace, refine, and reduce. Researchers should
     strive to replace animal models with nonliving models, replace vertebrates with invertebrates whenever
     possible, or use computer-models when applicable. They should refine husbandry and experimental procedures
     to reduce pain and suffering, and use experimental designs and procedures that reduce the number of animals
     needed to obtain the desired information. To obtain funding, researchers must satisfy NIH reviewers that the
     research justifies the use of animals and that their use is in accordance with the guidelines.

     At the local level, any facility that uses animals and receives federal funding must have an Institutional Animal
     Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that ensures that the NIH guidelines are being followed. The IACUC must
     include researchers, administrators, a veterinarian, and at least one person with no ties to the institution, that is,
     a concerned citizen. This committee also performs inspections of laboratories and protocols. For research
     involving human subjects, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) ensures that proper guidelines are followed.

     Blood Typing and Cross-Matching

     In addition to antibodies against bacteria and viruses to which they have previously been exposed, most individuals
     also carry antibodies against blood types other than their own. There are presently 33 immunologically important
     blood-type systems, many of which are restricted within various ethnic groups or rarely result in the production of
     antibodies. The most important and perhaps best known are the ABO and Rh blood groups (see Figure 19.4).

     When units of blood are being considered for transfusion, pretransfusion blood testing must be performed. For the
     blood unit, commercially prepared antibodies against the A, B, and Rh antigens are mixed with red blood cells from
     the units to initially confirm that the blood type on the unit is accurate. Once a unit of blood has been requested for
     transfusion, it is vitally important to make sure the donor (unit of blood) and recipient (patient) are compatible for
     these crucial antigens. In addition to confirming the blood type of the unit, the patient's blood type is also confirmed
     using the same commercially prepared antibodies to A, B, and Rh. For example, as shown in Figure 20.21, if the
     donor blood is A-positive, it will agglutinate with the anti-A antiserum and with the anti-Rh antiserum. If no
     agglutination is observed with any of the sera, then the blood type would be O-negative.

     Following determination of the blood type, immediately prior to releasing the blood for transfusion, a cross-match is
     performed in which a small aliquot of the donor red blood cells are mixed with serum from the patient awaiting
     transfusion. If the patient does have antibodies against the donor red blood cells, hemagglutination will occur. To
     confirm any negative test results and check for sensitized red blood cells, Coombs' reagent may be added to the mix

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                            20.3 · Agglutination Assays                              803

to facilitate visualization of the antibody-red blood cell interaction.

Under some circumstances, a minor cross-match may be performed as well. In this assay, a small aliquot of donor
serum is mixed with patient red blood cells. This allows the detection of agglutinizing antibodies in the donor serum.
This test is rarely necessary because transfusions generally use packed red blood cells with most of the plasma
removed by centrifugation.

Red blood cells have many other antigens in addition to ABO and Rh. While most people are unlikely to have
antibodies against these antigens, people who have had multiple pregnancies or patients who have had multiple
transfusions may have them because of repeated exposure. For this reason, an antibody screen test is used to
determine if such antibodies are present. Patient serum is checked against commercially prepared, pooled, type O
red blood cells that express these antigens. If agglutination occurs, the antigen to which the patient is responding
must be identified and determined not to be present in the donor unit.

FIGURE 20.21 This sample of a commercially produced "bedside" card enables quick typing of both a recipient's and donor's blood before
transfusion. The card contains three reaction sites or wells. One is coated with an anti-A antibody, one with an anti-B antibody, and one
with an anti-Rh antibody. Agglutination of red blood cells in a given site indicates a positive identification of the blood antigens: in this case,
A and Rh antigens for blood type A-positive.

         · Describe the difference and similarities between immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry
         · Describe the different purposes of direct and indirect ELISA

     Similar to the western blot, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) use antibodies to detect the presence of antigens.
     However, EIAs differ from western blots in that the assays are conducted in microtiter plates or in vivo rather than
     on an absorbent membrane. There are many different types of EIAs, but they all involve an antibody molecule
     whose constant region binds an enzyme, leaving the variable region free to bind its specific antigen. The addition of
     a substrate for the enzyme allows the antigen to be visualized or quantified (Figure 20.22).

     In EIAs, the substrate for the enzyme is most often a chromogen, a colorless molecule that is converted into a
     colored end product. The most widely used enzymes are alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase for
     which appropriate substrates are readily available. In some EIAs, the substrate is a fluorogen, a nonfluorescent
     molecule that the enzyme converts into a fluorescent form. EIAs that utilize a fluorogen are called fluorescent
     enzyme immunoassays (FEIAs). Fluorescence can be detected by either a fluorescence microscope or a
     spectrophotometer.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

The MMR Titer

The MMR vaccine is a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (German
measles). Most people receive the MMR vaccine as children and thus have antibodies against these diseases.
However, for various reasons, even vaccinated individuals may become susceptible to these diseases again later in
life. For example, some children may receive only one round of the MMR vaccine instead of the recommended two.
In addition, the titer of protective antibodies in an individual's body may begin to decline with age or as the result of
some medical conditions.

To determine whether the titer of antibody in an individual's bloodstream is sufficient to provide protection, an MMR
titer test can be performed. The test is a simple immunoassay that can be done quickly with a blood sample. The
results of the test will indicate whether the individual still has immunity or needs another dose of the MMR vaccine.

Submitting to an MMR titer is often a pre-employment requirement for healthcare workers, especially those who will
frequently be in contact with young children or immunocompromised patients. Were a healthcare worker to become
infected with measles, mumps, or rubella, the individual could easily pass these diseases on to susceptible patients,
leading to an outbreak. Depending on the results of the MMR titer, healthcare workers might need to be
revaccinated prior to beginning work.

Immunostaining

One powerful use of EIA is immunostaining, in which antibody-enzyme conjugates enhance microscopy.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used for examining whole tissues. As seen in Figure 20.23, a section of tissue can
be stained to visualize the various cell types. In this example, a mAb against CD8 was used to stain CD8 cells in a
section of tonsil tissue. It is now possible to count the number of CD8 cells, determine their relative numbers versus
the other cell types present, and determine the location of these cells within this tissue. Such data would be useful
for studying diseases such as AIDS, in which the normal function of CD8 cells is crucial for slowing disease
progression.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC) is another valuable form of immunostaining. While similar to IHC, in ICC, extracellular
matrix material is stripped away, and the cell membrane is etched with alcohol to make it permeable to antibodies.
This allows antibodies to pass through the cell membrane and bind to specific targets inside the cell. Organelles,
cytoskeletal components, and other intracellular structures can be visualized in this way. While some ICC
techniques use EIA, the enzyme can be replaced with a fluorescent molecule, making it a fluorescent immunoassay.

     Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs)

     The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are widely used EIAs. In the direct ELISA, antigens are
     immobilized in the well of a microtiter plate. An antibody that is specific for a particular antigen and is conjugated to
     an enzyme is added to each well. If the antigen is present, then the antibody will bind. After washing to remove any
     unbound antibodies, a colorless substrate (chromogen) is added. The presence of the enzyme converts the
     substrate into a colored end product (Figure 20.22). While this technique is faster because it only requires the use of
     one antibody, it has the disadvantage that the signal from a direct ELISA is lower (lower sensitivity).

     In a sandwich ELISA, the goal is to use antibodies to precisely quantify specific antigen present in a solution, such
     as antigen from a pathogen, a serum protein, or a hormone from the blood or urine to list just a few examples. The
     first step of a sandwich ELISA is to add the primary antibody to all the wells of a microtiter plate (Figure 20.24). The
     antibody sticks to the plastic by hydrophobic interactions. After an appropriate incubation time, any unbound
     antibody is washed away. Comparable washes are used between each of the subsequent steps to ensure that only
     specifically bound molecules remain attached to the plate. A blocking protein is then added (e.g., albumin or the
     milk protein casein) to bind the remaining nonspecific protein-binding sites in the well. Some of the wells will
     receive known amounts of antigen to allow the construction of a standard curve, and unknown antigen solutions are
     added to the other wells. The primary antibody captures the antigen and, following a wash, the secondary antibody
     is added, which is a polyclonal antibody that is conjugated to an enzyme. After a final wash, a colorless substrate
     (chromogen) is added, and the enzyme converts it into a colored end product. The color intensity of the sample
     caused by the end product is measured with a spectrophotometer. The amount of color produced (measured as
     absorbance) is directly proportional to the amount of enzyme, which in turn is directly proportional to the captured
     antigen. ELISAs are extremely sensitive, allowing antigen to be quantified in the nanogram (10-9 g) per mL range.

     In an indirect ELISA, we quantify antigen-specific antibody rather than antigen. We can use indirect ELISA to detect
     antibodies against many types of pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and HIV. There are three
     important differences between indirect and direct ELISAs as shown in Figure 20.25. Rather than using antibody to
     capture antigen, the indirect ELISA starts with attaching known antigen (e.g., peptides from HIV) to the bottom of
     the microtiter plate wells. After blocking the unbound sites on the plate, patient serum is added; if antibodies are
     present (primary antibody), they will bind the antigen. After washing away any unbound proteins, the secondary

antibody with its conjugated enzyme is directed against the primary antibody (e.g., antihuman immunoglobulin). The
secondary antibody allows us to quantify how much antigen-specific antibody is present in the patient's serum by
the intensity of the color produced from the conjugated enzyme-chromogen reaction.

As with several other tests for antibodies discussed in this chapter, there is always concern about cross-reactivity
with antibodies directed against some other antigen, which can lead to false-positive results. Thus, we cannot
definitively diagnose an HIV infection (or any other type of infection) based on a single indirect ELISA assay. We
must confirm any suspected positive test, which is most often done using either an immunoblot that actually
identifies the presence of specific peptides from the pathogen or a test to identify the nucleic acids associated with
the pathogen, such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) or a nucleic acid antigen test.

       Part 2

       Although contacting and testing the 1300 patients for HIV would be time consuming and expensive,
       administrators hoped to minimize the hospital's liability by proactively seeking out and treating potential victims
       of the rogue employee's crime. Early detection of HIV is important, and prompt treatment can slow the
       progression of the disease.

       There are a variety of screening tests for HIV, but the most widely used is the indirect ELISA. As with other
       indirect ELISAs, the test works by attaching antigen (in this case, HIV peptides) to a well in a 96-well plate. If the
       patient is HIV positive, anti-HIV antibodies will bind to the antigen and be identified by the second antibody-

     Immunofiltration and Immunochromatographic Assays

     For some situations, it may be necessary to detect or quantify antigens or antibodies that are present at very low
     concentration in solution. Immunofiltration techniques have been developed to make this possible. In
     immunofiltration, a large volume of fluid is passed through a porous membrane into an absorbent pad. An antigen
     attached to the porous membrane will capture antibody as it passes; alternatively, we can also attach an antibody to
     the membrane to capture antigen.

     The method of immunofiltration has been adapted in the development of immunochromatographic assays,
     commonly known as lateral flow tests or strip tests. These tests are quick and easy to perform, making them
     popular for point-of-care use (i.e., in the doctor's office) or in-home use. One example is the TORCH test that allows
     doctors to screen pregnant people or newborns for infection by an array of viruses and other pathogens
     (Toxoplasma, other viruses, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex). In-home pregnancy tests are another widely
     used example of a lateral flow test (Figure 20.26). Immunofiltration tests are also popular in developing countries,
     because they are inexpensive and do not require constant refrigeration of the dried reagents. However, the
     technology is also built into some sophisticated laboratory equipment.

     In lateral flow tests (Figure 20.27), fluids such as urine are applied to an absorbent pad on the test strip. The fluid
     flows by capillary action and moves through a stripe of beads with antibodies attached to their surfaces. The fluid in
     the sample actually hydrates the reagents, which are present in a dried state in the stripe. Antibody-coated beads
     made of latex or tiny gold particles will bind antigens in the test fluid. The antibody-antigen complexes then flow
     over a second stripe that has immobilized antibody against the antigen; this stripe will retain the beads that have
     bound antigen. A third control stripe binds any beads. A red color (from gold particles) or blue (from latex beads)
     developing at the test line indicates a positive test. If the color only develops at the control line, the test is negative.

     Like ELISA techniques, lateral flow tests take advantage of antibody sandwiches, providing sensitivity and
     specificity. While not as quantitative as ELISA, these tests have the advantage of being fast, inexpensive, and not
     dependent on special equipment. Thus, they can be performed anywhere by anyone. There are some concerns
     about putting such powerful diagnostic tests into the hands of people who may not understand the tests'
     limitations, such as the possibility of false-positive results. While home pregnancy tests have become widely
     accepted, at-home antibody-detection tests for diseases like HIV have raised some concerns in the medical
     community. Some have questioned whether self-administration of such tests should be allowed in the absence of
     medical personnel who can explain the test results and order appropriate confirmatory tests. However, with growing
     numbers of lateral flow tests becoming available, and the rapid development of lab-on-a-chip technology (Figure
     20.1), home medical tests are likely to become even more commonplace in the future.

  infected person is tested too soon after becoming infected, the test can yield false-negative results. The
  seroconversion window is generally about three weeks, but in some cases, it can be more than two months.

  In addition to false negatives, false positives can also occur, usually due to previous infections with other viruses
  that induce cross-reacting antibodies. The false-positive rate depends on the particular brand of test used, but
  0.5% is not unusual.10 Because of the possibility of a false positive, all positive tests are followed up with a
  confirmatory test. This confirmatory test is often an immunoblot (western blot) in which HIV peptides from the
  patient's blood are identified using an HIV-specific mAb-enzyme conjugate. A positive western blot would
  confirm an HIV infection and a negative blot would confirm the absence of HIV despite the positive ELISA.

  Unfortunately, western blots for HIV antigens often yield indeterminant results, in which case, they neither
  confirm nor invalidate the results of the indirect ELISA. In fact, the rate of indeterminants can be 10-49%
  (which is why, combined with their cost, western blots are not used for screening). Similar to the indirect ELISA,
  an indeterminant western blot can occur because of cross-reactivity or previous viral infections, vaccinations, or
  autoimmune diseases.

20.5 Fluorescent Antibody Techniques

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Describe the benefits of immunofluorescent antibody assays in comparison to nonfluorescent assays
    · Compare direct and indirect fluorescent antibody assays
    · Explain how a flow cytometer can be used to quantify specific subsets of cells present in a complex

        mixture of cell types
    · Explain how a fluorescence-activated cell sorter can be used to separate unique types of cells

Rapid visualization of bacteria from a clinical sample such as a throat swab or sputum can be achieved through
fluorescent antibody (FA) techniques that attach a fluorescent marker (fluorogen) to the constant region of an
antibody, resulting in a reporter molecule that is quick to use, easy to see or measure, and able to bind to target
markers with high specificity. We can also label cells, allowing us to precisely quantify particular subsets of cells or
even purify these subsets for further research.

As with the enzyme assays, FA methods may be direct, in which a labeled mAb binds an antigen, or indirect, in which
secondary polyclonal antibodies bind patient antibodies that react to a prepared antigen. Applications of these two
methods were demonstrated in Figure 2.19. FA methods are also used in automated cell counting and sorting
systems to enumerate or segregate labeled subpopulations of cells in a sample.

Direct Fluorescent Antibody Techniques

Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests use a fluorescently labeled mAb to bind and illuminate a target antigen.
DFA tests are particularly useful for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial diseases. For example, fluorescence-labeled
antibodies against Streptococcus pyogenes (group A strep) can be used to obtain a diagnosis of strep throat from a
throat swab. The diagnosis is ready in a matter of minutes, and the patient can be started on antibiotics before even
leaving the clinic. DFA techniques may also be used to diagnose pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae or
Legionella pneumophila from sputum samples (Figure 20.28). The fluorescent antibodies bind to the bacteria on a
microscope slide, allowing ready detection of the bacteria using a fluorescence microscope. Thus, the DFA
technique is valuable for visualizing certain bacteria that are difficult to isolate or culture from patient samples.

     Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Techniques

     Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests (Figure 20.29) are used to look for antibodies in patient serum. For
     example, an IFA test for the diagnosis of syphilis uses T. pallidum cells isolated from a lab animal (the bacteria
     cannot be grown on lab media) and a smear prepared on a glass slide. Patient serum is spread over the smear and
     anti-treponemal antibodies, if present, are allowed to bind. The serum is washed off and a secondary antibody
     added. The secondary antibody is an antihuman immunoglobulin conjugated to a fluorogen. On examination, the T.
     pallidum bacteria will only be visible if they have been bound by the antibodies from the patient's serum.
     The IFA test for syphilis provides an important complement to the VDRL test discussed in Detecting Antigen-
     Antibody Complexes. The VDRL is more likely to generate false-positive reactions than the IFA test; however, the
     VDRL is a better test for determining whether an infection is currently active.
     IFA tests are also useful for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus
     (SLE) (see Autoimmune Disorders) is characterized by elevated expression levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA).
     These autoantibodies can be expressed against a variety of DNA-binding proteins and even against DNA itself.
     Because autoimmunity is often difficult to diagnose, especially early in disease progression, testing for ANA can be a
     valuable clue in making a diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment.
     The IFA for ANA begins by fixing cells grown in culture to a glass slide and making them permeable to antibody. The
     slides are then incubated with serial dilutions of serum from the patient. After incubation, the slide is washed to
     remove unbound proteins, and the fluorescent antibody (antihuman IgG conjugated to a fluorogen) added. After an
     incubation and wash, the cells can be examined for fluorescence evident around the nucleus (Figure 20.30). The
     titer of ANA in the serum is determined by the highest dilution showing fluorescence. Because many healthy people
     express ANA, the American College of Rheumatology recommends that the titer must be at least 1:40 in the
     presence of symptoms involving two or more organ systems to be considered indicative of SLE.11

     Flow Cytometry

     Fluorescently labeled antibodies can be used to quantify cells of a specific type in a complex mixture using flow
     cytometry (Figure 20.31), an automated, cell-counting system that detects fluorescing cells as they pass through a
     narrow tube one cell at a time. For example, in HIV infections, it is important to know the level of CD4 T cells in the
     patient's blood; if the numbers fall below 500 per L of blood, the patient becomes more likely to acquire
     opportunistic infections; below 200 per L, the patient can no longer mount a useful adaptive immune response at
     all. The analysis begins by incubating a mixed-cell population (e.g., white blood cells from a donor) with a
     fluorescently labeled mAb specific for a subpopulation of cells (e.g., anti-CD4). Some experiments look at two cell
     markers simultaneously by adding a different fluorogen to the appropriate mAb. The cells are then introduced to the
     flow cytometer through a narrow capillary that forces the cells to pass in single file. A laser is used to activate the
     fluorogen. The fluorescent light radiates out in all directions, so the fluorescence detector can be positioned at an
     angle from the incident laser light.

     Figure 20.31 shows the obscuration bar in front of the forward-scatter detector that prevents laser light from hitting
     the detector. As a cell passes through the laser bar, the forward-scatter detector detects light scattered around the
     obscuration bar. The scattered light is transformed into a voltage pulse, and the cytometer counts a cell. The
     fluorescence from a labeled cell is detected by the side-scatter detectors. The light passes through various dichroic
     mirrors such that the light emitted from the fluorophore is received by the correct detector.

the fluorogen, and the fluorescence intensity of each cell is measured by a detector. (credit: modification of work by "Kierano"/Wikimedia
Commons)

Data are collected from both the forward- and side-scatter detectors. One way these data can be presented is in the
form of a histogram. The forward scatter is placed on the y-axis (to represent the number of cells), and the side
scatter is placed on the x-axis (to represent the fluoresence of each cell). The scaling for the x-axis is logarithmic, so
fluorescence intensity increases by a factor of 10 with each unit increase along the axis. Figure 20.32 depicts an
example in which a culture of cells is combined with an antibody attached to a fluorophore to detect CD8 cells and
then analyzed by flow cytometry. The histogram has two peaks. The peak on the left has lower fluorescence
readings, representing the subset of the cell population (approximately 30 cells) that does not fluoresce; hence,
they are not bound by antibody and therefore do not express CD8. The peak on the right has higher fluorescence
readings, representing the subset of the cell population (approximately 100 cells) that show fluorescence; hence,
they are bound by the antibody and therefore do express CD8.

FIGURE 20.32 Flow cytometry data are often compiled as a histogram. In the histogram, the area under each peak is proportional to the
number of cells in each population. The x-axis is the relative fluorescence expressed by the cells (on a log scale), and the y-axis represents
the number of cells at a particular level of fluorescence.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Resolution

       After notifying all 1300 patients, the hospital begins scheduling HIV screening. Appointments were scheduled a
       minimum of 3 weeks after the patient's last hospital visit to minimize the risk of false negatives. Because some
       false positives were anticipated, the public health physician set up a counseling protocol for any patient whose
       indirect ELISA came back positive.

       Of the 1300 patients, eight tested positive using the ELISA. Five of these tests were invalidated by negative
       western blot tests, but one western blot came back positive, confirming that the patient had indeed contracted
       HIV. The two remaining western blots came back indeterminate. These individuals had to submit to a third test,
       a PCR, to confirm the presence or absence of HIV sequences. Luckily, both patients tested negative.

       As for the lone patient confirmed to have HIV, the tests cannot prove or disprove any connection to the syringes
       compromised by the former hospital employee. Even so, the hospital's insurance will fully cover the patient's
       treatment, which began immediately.

       Although we now have drugs that are typically effective at controlling the progression of HIV and AIDS, there is
       still no cure. If left untreated, or if the drug regimen fails, the patient will experience a gradual decline in the
       number of CD4 helper T cells, resulting in severe impairment of all adaptive immune functions. Even moderate
       declines of helper T cell numbers can result in immunodeficiency, leaving the patient susceptible to
       opportunistic infections. To monitor the status of the patient's helper T cells, the hospital will use flow
       cytometry. This sensitive test allows physicians to precisely determine the number of helper T cells so they can
       adjust treatment if the number falls below 500 cells/µL.

     Cell Sorting Using Immunofluorescence

     The flow cytometer and immunofluorescence can also be modified to sort cells from a single sample into purified
     subpopulations of cells for research purposes. This modification of the flow cytometer is called a fluorescence-
     activated cell sorter (FACS). In a FACS, fluorescence by a cell induces the device to put a charge on a droplet of the
     transporting fluid containing that cell. The charge is specific to the wavelength of the fluorescent light, which allows
     for differential sorting by those different charges. The sorting is accomplished by an electrostatic deflector that
     moves the charged droplet containing the cell into one collecting vessel or another. The process results in highly
     purified subpopulations of cells.

     One limitation of a FACS is that it only works on isolated cells. Thus, the method would work in sorting white blood
     cells, since they exist as isolated cells. But for cells in a tissue, flow cytometry can only be applied if we can excise
     the tissue and separate it into single cells (using proteases to cleave cell-cell adhesion molecules) without
     disrupting cell integrity. This method may be used on tumors, but more often, immunohistochemistry and
     immunocytochemistry are used to study cells in tissues.

INTRODUCTION The human body is covered in skin, and like most coverings, skin is designed to protect what is
underneath. One of its primary purposes is to prevent microbes in the surrounding environment from invading
underlying tissues and organs. But in spite of its role as a protective covering, skin is not itself immune from
infection. Certain pathogens and toxins can cause severe infections or reactions when they come in contact with the
skin. Other pathogens are opportunistic, breaching the skin's natural defenses through cuts, wounds, or a disruption
of normal microbiota resulting in an infection in the surrounding skin and tissue. Still other pathogens enter the body
via different routes--through the respiratory or digestive systems, for example--but cause reactions that manifest as
skin rashes or lesions.
Nearly all humans experience skin infections to some degree. Many of these conditions are, as the name suggests,
"skin deep," with symptoms that are local and non-life-threatening. At some point, almost everyone must endure
conditions like acne, athlete's foot, and minor infections of cuts and abrasions, all of which result from infections of
the skin. But not all skin infections are quite so innocuous. Some can become invasive, leading to systemic infection
or spreading over large areas of skin, potentially becoming life-threatening.

       Sam, a college freshman with a bad habit of oversleeping, nicked himself shaving in a rush to get to class on
       time. At the time, he didn't think twice about it. But two days later, he noticed the cut was surrounded by a
       reddish area of skin that was warm to the touch. When the wound started oozing pus, he decided he had better
       stop by the university's clinic. The doctor took a sample from the lesion and then cleaned the area.

     Human skin is an important part of the innate immune system. In addition to serving a wide range of other functions,
     the skin serves as an important barrier to microbial invasion. Not only is it a physical barrier to penetration of deeper
     tissues by potential pathogens, but it also provides an inhospitable environment for the growth of many pathogens.
     In this section, we will provide a brief overview of the anatomy and normal microbiota of the skin and eyes, along
     with general symptoms associated with skin and eye infections.

     Layers of the Skin

     Human skin is made up of several layers and sublayers. The two main layers are the epidermis and the dermis.
     These layers cover a third layer of tissue called the hypodermis, which consists of fibrous and adipose connective
     tissue (Figure 21.2).

     The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and it is relatively thin. The exterior surface of the epidermis, called
     the stratum corneum, primarily consists of dead skin cells. This layer of dead cells limits direct contact between the
     outside world and live cells. The stratum corneum is rich in keratin, a tough, fibrous protein that is also found in hair
     and nails. Keratin helps make the outer surface of the skin relatively tough and waterproof. It also helps to keep the
     surface of the skin dry, which reduces microbial growth. However, some microbes are still able to live on the surface
     of the skin, and some of these can be shed with dead skin cells in the process of desquamation, which is the
     shedding and peeling of skin that occurs as a normal process but that may be accelerated when infection is present.

     Beneath the epidermis lies a thicker skin layer called the dermis. The dermis contains connective tissue and
     embedded structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and muscles. Structures called hair follicles (from which hair
     grows) are located within the dermis, even though much of their structure consists of epidermal tissue. The dermis
     also contains the two major types of glands found in human skin: sweat glands (tubular glands that produce sweat)
     and sebaceous glands (which are associated with hair follicles and produce sebum, a lipid-rich substance
     containing proteins and minerals).

     Perspiration (sweat) provides some moisture to the epidermis, which can increase the potential for microbial
     growth. For this reason, more microbes are found on the regions of the skin that produce the most sweat, such as
     the skin of the underarms and groin. However, in addition to water, sweat also contains substances that inhibit
     microbial growth, such as salts, lysozyme, and antimicrobial peptides. Sebum also serves to protect the skin and
     reduce water loss. Although some of the lipids and fatty acids in sebum inhibit microbial growth, sebum contains
     compounds that provide nutrition for certain microbes.

Normal Microbiota of the Skin

The skin is home to a wide variety of normal microbiota, consisting of commensal organisms that derive nutrition
from skin cells and secretions such as sweat and sebum. The normal microbiota of skin tends to inhibit transient-
microbe colonization by producing antimicrobial substances and outcompeting other microbes that land on the
surface of the skin. This helps to protect the skin from pathogenic infection.

The skin's properties differ from one region of the body to another, as does the composition of the skin's microbiota.
The availability of nutrients and moisture partly dictates which microorganisms will thrive in a particular region of
the skin. Relatively moist skin, such as that of the nares (nostrils) and underarms, has a much different microbiota
than the dryer skin on the arms, legs, hands, and top of the feet. Some areas of the skin have higher densities of
sebaceous glands. These sebum-rich areas, which include the back, the folds at the side of the nose, and the back
of the neck, harbor distinct microbial communities that are less diverse than those found on other parts of the body.

Different types of bacteria dominate the dry, moist, and sebum-rich regions of the skin. The most abundant
microbes typically found in the dry and sebaceous regions are Betaproteobacteria and Propionibacteria,
respectively. In the moist regions, Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus are most commonly found (Figure 21.3).
Viruses and fungi are also found on the skin, with Malassezia being the most common type of fungus found as part
of the normal microbiota. The role and populations of viruses in the microbiota, known as viromes, are still not well
understood, and there are limitations to the techniques used to identify them. However, Circoviridae,
Papillomaviridae, and Polyomaviridae appear to be the most common residents in the healthy skin virome.1 2 3

         · What are the four most common bacteria that are part of the normal skin microbiota?

     Infections of the Skin

     While the microbiota of the skin can play a protective role, it can also cause harm in certain cases. Often, an
     opportunistic pathogen residing in the skin microbiota of one individual may be transmitted to another individual
     more susceptible to an infection. For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can often take
     up residence in the nares of health care workers and hospital patients; though harmless on intact, healthy skin,
     MRSA can cause infections if introduced into other parts of the body, as might occur during surgery or via a post-
     surgical incision or wound. This is one reason why clean surgical sites are so important.
     Injury or damage to the skin can allow microbes to enter deeper tissues, where nutrients are more abundant and
     the environment is more conducive to bacterial growth. Wound infections are common after a puncture or laceration
     that damages the physical barrier of the skin. Microbes may infect structures in the dermis, such as hair follicles and
     glands, causing a localized infection, or they may reach the bloodstream, which can lead to a systemic infection.
     In some cases, infectious microbes can cause a variety of rashes or lesions that differ in their physical
     characteristics. These rashes can be the result of inflammation reactions or direct responses to toxins produced by
     the microbes. Table 21.1 lists some of the medical terminology used to describe skin lesions and rashes based on
     their characteristics; Figure 21.4 and Figure 21.5 illustrate some of the various types of skin lesions. It is important
     to note that many different diseases can lead to skin conditions of very similar appearance; thus the terms used in
     the table are generally not exclusive to a particular type of infection or disease.

     Anatomy and Microbiota of the Eye

     Although the eye and skin have distinct anatomy, they are both in direct contact with the external environment. An
     important component of the eye is the nasolacrimal drainage system, which serves as a conduit for the fluid of the
     eye, called tears. Tears flow from the external eye to the nasal cavity by the lacrimal apparatus, which is composed
     of the structures involved in tear production (Figure 21.6). The lacrimal gland, above the eye, secretes tears to keep
     the eye moist. There are two small openings, one on the inside edge of the upper eyelid and one on the inside edge
     of the lower eyelid, near the nose. Each of these openings is called a lacrimal punctum. Together, these lacrimal
     puncta collect tears from the eye that are then conveyed through lacrimal ducts to a reservoir for tears called the
     lacrimal sac, also known as the dacrocyst or tear sac.
     From the sac, tear fluid flows via a nasolacrimal duct to the inner nose. Each nasolacrimal duct is located
     underneath the skin and passes through the bones of the face into the nose. Chemicals in tears, such as defensins,

microbes from the surface of the eye.

The surfaces of the eyeball and inner eyelid are mucous membranes called conjunctiva. The normal conjunctival
microbiota has not been well characterized, but does exist. One small study (part of the Ocular Microbiome project)
found twelve genera that were consistently present in the conjunctiva.4 These microbes are thought to help defend
the membranes against pathogens. However, it is still unclear which microbes may be transient and which may form
a stable microbiota.5

Use of contact lenses can cause changes in the normal microbiota of the conjunctiva by introducing another surface
into the natural anatomy of the eye. Research is currently underway to better understand how contact lenses may
impact the normal microbiota and contribute to eye disease.

The watery material inside of the eyeball is called the vitreous humor. Unlike the conjunctiva, it is protected from
contact with the environment and is almost always sterile, with no normal microbiota (Figure 21.7).

                        FIGURE 21.7 Some microbes live on the conjunctiva of the human eye, but the vitreous humor is sterile.

Infections of the Eye

The conjunctiva is a frequent site of infection of the eye; like other mucous membranes, it is also a common portal of
entry for pathogens. Inflammation of the conjunctiva is called conjunctivitis, although it is commonly known as
pinkeye because of the pink appearance in the eye. Infections of deeper structures, beneath the cornea, are less
common (Figure 21.8). Conjunctivitis occurs in multiple forms. It may be acute or chronic. Acute purulent

     conjunctivitis is associated with pus formation, while acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is associated with bleeding in
     the conjunctiva. The term blepharitis refers to an inflammation of the eyelids, while keratitis refers to an
     inflammation of the cornea (Figure 21.8); keratoconjunctivitis is an inflammation of both the cornea and the
     conjunctiva, and dacryocystitis is an inflammation of the lacrimal sac that can often occur when a nasolacrimal duct
     is blocked.

     Infections leading to conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, or dacryocystitis may be caused by bacteria or
     viruses, but allergens, pollutants, or chemicals can also irritate the eye and cause inflammation of various
     structures. Viral infection is a more likely cause of conjunctivitis in cases with symptoms such as fever and watery
     discharge that occurs with upper respiratory infection and itchy eyes. Table 21.2 summarizes some common forms
     of conjunctivitis and blepharitis.

21.2 Bacterial Infections of the Skin and Eyes

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common bacterial pathogens that cause infections of the skin and eyes
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific bacterial diseases affecting the skin and eyes

Despite the skin's protective functions, infections are common. Gram-positive Staphylococcus spp. and
Streptococcus spp. are responsible for many of the most common skin infections. However, many skin conditions
are not strictly associated with a single pathogen. Opportunistic pathogens of many types may infect skin wounds,
and individual cases with identical symptoms may result from different pathogens or combinations of pathogens.

In this section, we will examine some of the most important bacterial infections of the skin and eyes and discuss
how biofilms can contribute to and exacerbate such infections. Key features of bacterial skin and eye infections are
also summarized in the Disease Profile boxes throughout this section.

Staphylococcal Infections of the Skin

Staphylococcus species are commonly found on the skin, with S. epidermidis and S. hominis being prevalent in the
normal microbiota. S. aureus is also commonly found in the nasal passages and on healthy skin, but pathogenic
strains are often the cause of a broad range of infections of the skin and other body systems.

S. aureus is quite contagious. It is spread easily through skin-to-skin contact, and because many people are chronic
nasal carriers (asymptomatic individuals who carry S. aureus in their nares), the bacteria can easily be transferred
from the nose to the hands and then to fomites or other individuals. Because it is so contagious, S. aureus is
prevalent in most community settings. This prevalence is particularly problematic in hospitals, where antibiotic-
resistant strains of the bacteria may be present, and where immunocompromised patients may be more susceptible
to infection. Resistant strains include methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which can be acquired through health-
care settings (hospital-acquired MRSA, or HA-MRSA) or in the community (community-acquired MRSA, or CA-
MRSA). Hospital patients often arrive at health-care facilities already colonized with antibiotic-resistant strains of S.
aureus that can be transferred to health-care providers and other patients. Some hospitals have attempted to detect
these individuals in order to institute prophylactic measures, but they have had mixed success (see Eye on Ethics:
Screening Patients for MRSA).

When a staphylococcal infection develops, choice of medication is important. As discussed above, many
staphylococci (such as MRSA) are resistant to some or many antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic sensitivity is measured to
identify the most suitable antibiotic. However, even before receiving the results of sensitivity analysis, suspected S.
aureus infections are often initially treated with drugs known to be effective against MRSA, such as trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), clindamycin, a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline), or linezolid.

The pathogenicity of staphylococcal infections is often enhanced by characteristic chemicals secreted by some
834  21 · Skin and Eye Infections

     strains. Staphylococcal virulence factors include hemolysins called staphylolysins, which are cytotoxic for many
     types of cells, including skin cells and white blood cells. Virulent strains of S. aureus are also coagulase-positive,
     meaning they produce coagulase, a plasma-clotting protein that is involved in abscess formation. They may also
     produce leukocidins, which kill white blood cells and can contribute to the production of pus and Protein A, which
     inhibits phagocytosis by binding to the constant region of antibodies. Some virulent strains of S. aureus also produce
     other toxins, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens).

     To confirm the causative agent of a suspected staphylococcal skin infection, samples from the wound are cultured.
     Under the microscope, gram-positive Staphylococcus species have cellular arrangements that form grapelike
     clusters; when grown on blood agar, colonies have a unique pigmentation ranging from opaque white to cream. A
     catalase test is used to distinguish Staphylococcus from Streptococcus, which is also a genus of gram-positive cocci
     and a common cause of skin infections. Staphylococcus species are catalase-positive while Streptococcus species
     are catalase-negative.

     Other tests are performed on samples from the wound in order to distinguish coagulase-positive species of
     Staphylococcus (CoPS) such as S. aureus from common coagulase-negative species (CoNS) such as S. epidermidis.
     Although CoNS are less likely than CoPS to cause human disease, they can cause infections when they enter the
     body, as can sometimes occur via catheters, indwelling medical devices, and wounds. Passive agglutination testing
     can be used to distinguish CoPS from CoNS. If the sample is coagulase-positive, the sample is generally presumed
     to contain S. aureus. Additional genetic testing would be necessary to identify the particular strain of S. aureus.

     Another way to distinguish CoPS from CoNS is by culturing the sample on mannitol salt agar (MSA). Staphylococcus
     species readily grow on this medium because they are tolerant of the high concentration of sodium chloride (7.5%
     NaCl). However, CoPS such as S. aureus ferment mannitol (which will be evident on a MSA plate), whereas CoNS
     such as S. epidermidis do not ferment mannitol but can be distinguished by the fermentation of other sugars such as
     lactose, malonate, and raffinose (Figure 21.9).

     FIGURE 21.9 (a) A mannitol salt agar plate is used to distinguish different species of staphylococci. In this plate, S. aureus is on the left and
     S. epidermidis is in the right. Because S. aureus is capable of fermenting mannitol, it produces acids that cause the color to change to
     yellow. (b) This scanning electron micrograph shows the characteristic grapelike clusters of S. aureus. (credit a: modification of work by

       EYE ON ETHICS
       Screening Patients for MRSA

       According to the CDC, 86% of invasive MRSA infections are associated in some way with healthcare, as opposed
       to being community-acquired. In hospitals and clinics, asymptomatic patients who harbor MRSA may spread the
       bacteria to individuals who are more susceptible to serious illness.
       In an attempt to control the spread of MRSA, hospitals have tried screening patients for MRSA. If patients test
       positive following a nasal swab test, they can undergo decolonization using chlorhexidine washes or intranasal
       mupirocin. Some studies have reported substantial reductions in MRSA disease following implementation of

these protocols, while others have not. This is partly because there is no standard protocol for these procedures.
Several different MRSA identification tests may be used, some involving slower culturing techniques and others
rapid testing. Other factors, such as the effectiveness of general hand-washing protocols, may also play a role in
helping to prevent MRSA transmission. There are still other questions that need to be addressed: How
frequently should patients be screened? Which individuals should be tested? From where on the body should
samples be collected? Will increased resistance develop from the decolonization procedures?

Even if identification and decolonization procedures are perfected, ethical questions will remain. Should
patients have the right to decline testing? Should a patient who tests positive for MRSA have the right to decline
the decolonization procedure, and if so, should hospitals have the right to refuse treatment to the patient? How
do we balance the individual's right to receive care with the rights of other patients who could be exposed to
disease as a result?

Superficial Staphylococcal Infections
S. aureus is often associated with pyoderma, skin infections that are purulent. Pus formation occurs because many
strains of S. aureus produce leukocidins, which kill white blood cells. These purulent skin infections may initially
manifest as folliculitis, but can lead to furuncles or deeper abscesses called carbuncles.

Folliculitis generally presents as bumps and pimples that may be itchy, red, and/or pus-filled. In some cases,
folliculitis is self-limiting, but if it continues for more than a few days, worsens, or returns repeatedly, it may require
medical treatment. Sweat, skin injuries, ingrown hairs, tight clothing, irritation from shaving, and skin conditions can
all contribute to folliculitis. Avoidance of tight clothing and skin irritation can help to prevent infection, but topical
antibiotics (and sometimes other treatments) may also help. Folliculitis can be identified by skin inspection;
treatment is generally started without first culturing and identifying the causative agent.

In contrast, furuncles (boils) are deeper infections (Figure 21.10). They are most common in those individuals
(especially young adults and teenagers) who play contact sports, share athletic equipment, have poor nutrition, live
in close quarters, or have weakened immune systems. Good hygiene and skin care can often help to prevent
furuncles from becoming more infective, and they generally resolve on their own. However, if furuncles spread,
increase in number or size, or lead to systemic symptoms such as fever and chills, then medical care is needed. They
may sometimes need to be drained (at which time the pathogens can be cultured) and treated with antibiotics.

When multiple boils develop into a deeper lesion, it is called a carbuncle (Figure 21.10). Because carbuncles are
deeper, they are more commonly associated with systemic symptoms and a general feeling of illness. Larger,
recurrent, or worsening carbuncles require medical treatment, as do those associated with signs of illness such as
fever. Carbuncles generally need to be drained and treated with antibiotics. While carbuncles are relatively easy to
identify visually, culturing and laboratory analysis of the wound may be recommended for some infections because
antibiotic resistance is relatively common.

Proper hygiene is important to prevent these types of skin infections or to prevent the progression of existing
infections.

pus and exhibits swelling. (b) A carbuncle is a pus-filled lesion that is typically deeper than the furuncle. It often forms from multiple

     Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is another superficial infection caused by S. aureus that is most
     commonly seen in young children, especially infants. Bacterial exotoxins first produce erythema (redness of the
     skin) and then severe peeling of the skin, as might occur after scalding (Figure 21.11). SSSS is diagnosed by
     examining characteristics of the skin (which may rub off easily), using blood tests to check for elevated white blood
     cell counts, culturing, and other methods. Intravenous antibiotics and fluid therapy are used as treatment.

     modification of work by D Jeyakumari, R Gopal, M Eswaran, and C MaheshKumar)

     Impetigo
     The skin infection impetigo causes the formation of vesicles, pustules, and possibly bullae, often around the nose
     and mouth. Bullae are large, fluid-filled blisters that measure at least 5 mm in diameter. Impetigo can be diagnosed
     as either nonbullous or bullous. In nonbullous impetigo, vesicles and pustules rupture and become encrusted sores.
     Typically the crust is yellowish, often with exudate draining from the base of the lesion. In bullous impetigo, the
     bullae fill and rupture, resulting in larger, draining, encrusted lesions (Figure 21.12).

     Especially common in children, impetigo is particularly concerning because it is highly contagious. Impetigo can be
     caused by S. aureus alone, by Streptococcus pyogenes alone, or by coinfection of S. aureus and S. pyogenes.
     Impetigo is often diagnosed through observation of its characteristic appearance, although culture and
     susceptibility testing may also be used.

     Topical or oral antibiotic treatment is typically effective in treating most cases of impetigo. However, cases caused
     by S. pyogenes can lead to serious sequelae (pathological conditions resulting from infection, disease, injury,
     therapy, or other trauma) such as acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), which is severe inflammation in the kidneys.

     Nosocomial S. epidermidis Infections
     Though not as virulent as S. aureus, the staphylococcus S. epidermidis can cause serious opportunistic infections.
     Such infections usually occur only in hospital settings. S. epidermidis is usually a harmless resident of the normal
     skin microbiota. However, health-care workers can inadvertently transfer S. epidermidis to medical devices that are

inserted into the body, such as catheters, prostheses, and indwelling medical devices. Once it has bypassed the skin
barrier, S. epidermidis can cause infections inside the body that can be difficult to treat. Like S. aureus, S.
epidermidis is resistant to many antibiotics, and localized infections can become systemic if not treated quickly. To
reduce the risk of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) S. epidermidis, health-care workers must follow strict procedures
for handling and sterilizing medical devices before and during surgical procedures.

Streptococcal Infections of the Skin

Streptococcus are gram-positive cocci with a microscopic morphology that resembles chains of bacteria. Colonies
are typically small (1-2 mm in diameter), translucent, entire edge, with a slightly raised elevation that can be either
nonhemolytic, alpha-hemolytic, or beta-hemolytic when grown on blood agar (Figure 21.13). Additionally, they are
facultative anaerobes that are catalase-negative.

 FIGURE 21.13 Streptococcus pyogenes forms chains of cocci. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

The genus Streptococcus includes important pathogens that are categorized in serological Lancefield groups based
on the distinguishing characteristics of their surface carbohydrates. The most clinically important streptococcal
species in humans is S. pyogenes, also known as group A streptococcus (GAS). S. pyogenes produces a variety of
extracellular enzymes, including streptolysins O and S, hyaluronidase, and streptokinase. These enzymes can aid in
transmission and contribute to the inflammatory response.6 S. pyogenes also produces a capsule and M protein, a
streptococcal cell wall protein. These virulence factors help the bacteria to avoid phagocytosis while provoking a
substantial immune response that contributes to symptoms associated with streptococcal infections.

S. pyogenes causes a wide variety of diseases not only in the skin, but in other organ systems as well. Examples of
diseases elsewhere in the body include pharyngitis and scarlet fever, which will be covered in later chapters.

Cellulitis, Erysipelas, and Erythema Nosodum
Common streptococcal conditions of the skin include cellulitis, erysipelas, and erythema nodosum. An infection that
develops in the dermis or hypodermis can cause cellulitis, which presents as a reddened area of the skin that is
warm to the touch and painful. The causative agent is often S. pyogenes, which may breach the epidermis through a
cut or abrasion, although cellulitis may also be caused by staphylococci. S. pyogenes can also cause erysipelas, a
condition that presents as a large, intensely inflamed patch of skin involving the dermis (often on the legs or face).
These infections can be suppurative, which results in a bullous form of erysipelas. Streptococcal and other
pathogens may also cause a condition called erythema nodosum, characterized by inflammation in the
subcutaneous fat cells of the hypodermis. It sometimes results from a streptococcal infection, though other
pathogens can also cause the condition. It is not suppurative, but leads to red nodules on the skin, most frequently

     on the shins (Figure 21.14).

     In general, streptococcal infections are best treated through identification of the specific pathogen followed by
     treatment based upon that particular pathogen's susceptibility to different antibiotics. Many immunological tests,
     including agglutination reactions and ELISAs, can be used to detect streptococci. Penicillin is commonly prescribed
     for treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas because resistance is not widespread in streptococci at this time. In most
     patients, erythema nodosum is self-limiting and is not treated with antimicrobial drugs. Recommended treatments
     may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cool wet compresses, elevation, and bed rest.

     Necrotizing Fasciitis
     Streptococcal infections that start in the skin can sometimes spread elsewhere, resulting in a rare but potentially
     life-threatening condition called necrotizing fasciitis, sometimes referred to as flesh-eating bacterial syndrome. S.
     pyogenes is one of several species that can cause this rare but potentially-fatal condition; others include Klebsiella,
     Clostridium, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and Aeromonas hydrophila.

     Necrotizing fasciitis occurs when the fascia, a thin layer of connective tissue between the skin and muscle, becomes
     infected. Severe invasive necrotizing fasciitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes occurs when virulence factors that are
     responsible for adhesion and invasion overcome host defenses. S. pyogenes invasins allow bacterial cells to adhere
     to tissues and establish infection. Bacterial proteases unique to S. pyogenes aggressively infiltrate and destroy host
     tissues, inactivate complement, and prevent neutrophil migration to the site of infection. The infection and resulting
     tissue death can spread very rapidly, as large areas of skin become detached and die. Treatment generally requires
     debridement (surgical removal of dead or infected tissue) or amputation of infected limbs to stop the spread of the
     infection; surgical treatment is supplemented with intravenous antibiotics and other therapies (Figure 21.15).

     Necrotizing fasciitis does not always originate from a skin infection; in some cases there is no known portal of entry.
     Some studies have suggested that experiencing a blunt force trauma can increase the risk of developing
     streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis.7

Pseudomonas Infections of the Skin

Another important skin pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative, oxidase-positive, aerobic bacillus
that is commonly found in water and soil as well as on human skin. P. aeruginosa is a common cause of
opportunistic infections of wounds and burns. It can also cause hot tub rash, a condition characterized by folliculitis
that frequently afflicts users of pools and hot tubs (recall the Clinical Focus case in Microbial Biochemistry). P.
aeruginosa is also the cause of otitis externa (swimmer's ear), an infection of the ear canal that causes itching,
redness, and discomfort, and can progress to fever, pain, and swelling (Figure 21.16).

FIGURE 21.16 (a) Hot tub folliculitis presents as an itchy red rash. It is typically caused by P. aeruginosa, a bacterium that thrives in wet,
warm environments such as hot tubs. (b) Otitis externa (swimmer's ear) may also be caused by P. aeruginosa or other bacteria commonly
found in water. Inflammation of the outer ear and ear canal can lead to painful swelling. (credit b: modification of work by Klaus D. Peter)

Wounds infected with P. aeruginosa have a distinctive odor resembling grape soda or fresh corn tortillas. This odor is
caused by the 2-aminoacetophenone that is used by P. aeruginosa in quorum sensing and contributes to its
pathogenicity. Wounds infected with certain strains of P. aeruginosa also produce a blue-green pus due to the
pigments pyocyanin and pyoverdin, which also contribute to its virulence. Pyocyanin and pyoverdin are
siderophores that help P. aeruginosa survive in low-iron environments by enhancing iron uptake. P. aeruginosa also
produces several other virulence factors, including phospholipase C (a hemolysin capable of breaking down red
blood cells), exoenzyme S (involved in adherence to epithelial cells), and exotoxin A (capable of causing tissue
necrosis). Other virulence factors include a slime that allows the bacterium to avoid being phagocytized, fimbriae for
840  21 · Skin and Eye Infections

     adherence, and proteases that cause tissue damage. P. aeruginosa can be detected through the use of cetrimide
     agar, which is selective for Pseudomonas species (Figure 21.17).

     FIGURE 21.17 (a) These P. aeruginosa colonies are growing on xylose lysine sodium deoxycholate (XLD) agar. (b) Pseudomonas spp. can
     produce a variety of blue-green pigments. (c) Pseudomonas spp. may produce fluorescein, which fluoresces green under ultraviolet light
     under the right conditions. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Pseudomonas spp. tend to be resistant to most antibiotics. They often produce -lactamases, may have mutations
     affecting porins (small cell wall channels) that affect antibiotic uptake, and may pump some antibiotics out of the
     cell, contributing to this resistance. Polymyxin B and gentamicin are effective, as are some fluoroquinolones. Otitis
     externa is typically treated with ear drops containing acetic acid, antibacterials, and/or steroids to reduce
     inflammation; ear drops may also include antifungals because fungi can sometimes cause or contribute to otitis
     externa. Wound infections caused by Pseudomonas spp. may be treated with topical antibiofilm agents that disrupt
     the formation of biofilms.

     Acne

     One of the most ubiquitous skin conditions is acne. Acne afflicts nearly 80% of teenagers and young adults, but it
     can be found in individuals of all ages. Higher incidence among adolescents is due to hormonal changes that can
     result in overproduction of sebum.

     Acne occurs when hair follicles become clogged by shed skin cells and sebum, causing non-inflammatory lesions
     called comedones. Comedones (singular "comedo") can take the form of whitehead and blackhead pimples.
     Whiteheads are covered by skin, whereas blackhead pimples are not; the black color occurs when lipids in the
     clogged follicle become exposed to the air and oxidize (Figure 21.18).

visible as black spots on the skin, have a dark appearance due to the oxidation of lipids in sebum via exposure to the air. (credit a:
modification of work by Bruce Blaus)

Often comedones lead to infection by Propionibacterium acnes, a gram-positive, non-spore-forming, aerotolerant
anaerobic bacillus found on skin that consumes components of sebum. P. acnes secretes enzymes that damage the
hair follicle, causing inflammatory lesions that may include papules, pustules, nodules, or pseudocysts, depending
on their size and severity.

Treatment of acne depends on the severity of the case. There are multiple ways to grade acne severity, but three
levels are usually considered based on the number of comedones, the number of inflammatory lesions, and the
types of lesions. Mild acne is treated with topical agents that may include salicylic acid (which helps to remove old
skin cells) or retinoids (which have multiple mechanisms, including the reduction of inflammation). Moderate acne
may be treated with antibiotics (erythromycin, clindamycin), acne creams (e.g., benzoyl peroxide), and hormones.
Severe acne may require treatment using strong medications such as isotretinoin (a retinoid that reduces oil
buildup, among other effects, but that also has serious side effects such as photosensitivity). Other treatments,
such as phototherapy and laser therapy to kill bacteria and possibly reduce oil production, are also sometimes used.

  Resolution

  Sam uses the topical antibiotic over the weekend to treat his wound, but he does not see any improvement. On
  Monday, the doctor calls to inform him that the results from his laboratory tests are in. The tests show evidence
  of both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus in his wound. The bacterial species were confirmed using several
  tests. A passive agglutination test confirmed the presence of S. aureus. In this type of test, latex beads with
  antibodies cause agglutination when S. aureus is present. Streptococcus pyogenes was confirmed in the wound
  based on bacitracin (0.04 units) susceptibility as well as latex agglutination tests specific for S. pyogenes.

  Because many strains of S. aureus are resistant to antibiotics, the doctor had also requested an antimicrobial
  susceptibility test (AST) at the same time the specimen was submitted for identification. The results of the AST
  indicated no drug resistance for the Streptococcus spp.; the Staphylococcus spp. showed resistance to several
  common antibiotics, but were susceptible to cefoxitin and oxacillin. Once Sam began to use these new
  antibiotics, the infection resolved within a week and the lesion healed.

     Anthrax

     The zoonotic disease anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, endospore-forming, facultative
     anaerobe. Anthrax mainly affects animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, and deer, but can be found in humans as
     well. Sometimes called wool sorter's disease, it is often transmitted to humans through contact with infected
     animals or animal products, such as wool or hides. However, exposure to B. anthracis can occur by other means, as
     the endospores are widespread in soils and can survive for long periods of time, sometimes for hundreds of years.

     The vast majority of anthrax cases (95-99%) occur when anthrax endospores enter the body through abrasions of
     the skin.8 This form of the disease is called cutaneous anthrax. It is characterized by the formation of a nodule on
     the skin; the cells within the nodule die, forming a black eschar, a mass of dead skin tissue (Figure 21.19). The
     localized infection can eventually lead to bacteremia and septicemia. If untreated, cutaneous anthrax can cause
     death in 20% of patients.9 Once in the skin tissues, B. anthracis endospores germinate and produce a capsule,
     which prevents the bacteria from being phagocytized, and two binary exotoxins that cause edema and tissue
     damage. The first of the two exotoxins consists of a combination of protective antigen (PA) and an enzymatic lethal
     factor (LF), forming lethal toxin (LeTX). The second consists of protective antigen (PA) and an edema factor (EF),
     forming edema toxin (EdTX).

     FIGURE 21.19 (a) Cutaneous anthrax is an infection of the skin by B. anthracis, which produces tissue-damaging exotoxins. Dead tissues
     accumulating in this nodule have produced a small black eschar. (b) Colonies of B. anthracis grown on sheep's blood agar. (credit a, b:
     modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Less commonly, anthrax infections can be initiated through other portals of entry such as the digestive tract
     (gastrointestinal anthrax) or respiratory tract (pulmonary anthrax or inhalation anthrax). Typically, cases of
     noncutaneous anthrax are more difficult to treat than the cutaneous form. The mortality rate for gastrointestinal
     anthrax can be up to 40%, even with treatment. Inhalation anthrax, which occurs when anthrax spores are inhaled,
     initially causes influenza-like symptoms, but mortality rates are approximately 45% in treated individuals and 85%
     in those not treated. A relatively new form of the disease, injection anthrax, has been reported in Europe in
     intravenous drug users; it occurs when drugs are contaminated with B. anthracis. Patients with injection anthrax
     show signs and symptoms of severe soft tissue infection that differ clinically from cutaneous anthrax. This often
     delays diagnosis and treatment, and leads to a high mortality rate.10

     B. anthracis colonies on blood agar have a rough texture and serrated edges that eventually form an undulating
     band (Figure 21.19). Broad spectrum antibiotics such as penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline are often effective
     treatments.

Unfortunately, B. anthracis has been used as a biological weapon and remains on the United Nations' list of potential
agents of bioterrorism.11 Over a period of several months in 2001, a number of letters were mailed to members of
the news media and the United States Congress. As a result, 11 individuals developed cutaneous anthrax and
another 11 developed inhalation anthrax. Those infected included recipients of the letters, postal workers, and two
other individuals. Five of those infected with pulmonary anthrax died. The anthrax spores had been carefully
prepared to aerosolize, showing that the perpetrator had a high level of expertise in microbiology.12

A vaccine is available to protect individuals from anthrax. However, unlike most routine vaccines, the current anthrax
vaccine is unique in both its formulation and the protocols dictating who receives it.13 The vaccine is administered
through five intramuscular injections over a period of 18 months, followed by annual boosters. The US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved administration of the vaccine prior to exposure for at-risk adults, such
as individuals who work with anthrax in a laboratory, some individuals who handle animals or animal products (e.g.,
some veterinarians), and some members of the United States military. The vaccine protects against cutaneous and
inhalation anthrax using cell-free filtrates of microaerophilic cultures of an avirulent, nonencapsulated strain of B.
anthracis.14 The FDA has not approved the vaccine for routine use after exposure to anthrax, but if there were ever
an anthrax emergency in the United States, patients could be given anthrax vaccine after exposure to help prevent
disease.

Bacterial Infections of the Skin

Bacterial infections of the skin can cause a wide range of symptoms and syndromes, ranging from the superficial
and relatively harmless to the severe and even fatal. Most bacterial skin infections can be diagnosed by culturing
the bacteria and treated with antibiotics. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is also often necessary because
many strains of bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance. Figure 21.20 summarizes the characteristics of

     Bacterial Conjunctivitis

     Like the skin, the surface of the eye comes in contact with the outside world and is somewhat prone to infection by
     bacteria in the environment. Bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the
     conjunctiva, often accompanied by a discharge of sticky fluid (described as acute purulent conjunctivitis) (Figure
     21.21). Conjunctivitis can affect one eye or both, and it usually does not affect vision permanently. Bacterial
     conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae, but can also be caused by other species such
     as Moraxella catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. The causative agent may be identified using bacterial
     cultures, Gram stain, and diagnostic biochemical, antigenic, or nucleic acid profile tests of the isolated pathogen.
     Bacterial conjunctivitis is very contagious, being transmitted via secretions from infected individuals, but it is also
     self-limiting. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves in a few days, but topical antibiotics are sometimes prescribed.
     Because this condition is so contagious, medical attention is recommended whenever it is suspected. Individuals
     who use contact lenses should discontinue their use when conjunctivitis is suspected. Certain symptoms, such as
     blurred vision, eye pain, and light sensitivity, can be associated with serious conditions and require medical
     attention.

Neonatal Conjunctivitis
Infants born to people who have certain sexually transmitted infections are at risk of contracting ophthalmia
neonatorum or inclusion conjunctivitis, which are two forms of neonatal conjunctivitis contracted through
exposure to pathogens during passage through the birth canal. Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum is caused by
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes the STD gonorrhea (Figure 21.22). Inclusion (chlamydial)
conjunctivitis is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, the anaerobic, obligate, intracellular parasite that causes the STD
chlamydia.
To prevent gonoccocal ophthalmia neonatorum, silver nitrate ointments were once routinely applied to all infants'
eyes shortly after birth; however, it is now more common to apply antibacterial creams or drops, such as
erythromycin. Most hospitals are required by law to provide this preventative treatment to all infants, because
conjunctivitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, or other bacteria acquired during a vaginal delivery can
have serious complications. If untreated, the infection can spread to the cornea, resulting in ulceration or
perforation that can cause vision loss or even permanent blindness. As such, neonatal conjunctivitis is treated
aggressively with oral or intravenous antibiotics to stop the spread of the infection. Causative agents of inclusion
conjunctivitis may be identified using bacterial cultures, Gram stain, and diagnostic biochemical, antigenic, or
nucleic acid profile tests.

Trachoma

Trachoma, or granular conjunctivitis, is a common cause of preventable blindness that is rare in the United States
but widespread in developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia. The condition is caused by the same species
that causes neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis in infants, Chlamydia trachomatis. C. trachomatis can be transmitted
easily through fomites such as contaminated towels, bed linens, and clothing and also by direct contact with
infected individuals. C. trachomatis can also be spread by flies that transfer infected mucous containing C.
trachomatis from one human to another.
Infection by C. trachomatis causes chronic conjunctivitis, which leads to the formation of necrotic follicles and

     scarring in the upper eyelid. The scars turn the eyelashes inward (a condition known as trichiasis) and mechanical
     abrasion of the cornea leads to blindness (Figure 21.23). Antibiotics such as azithromycin are effective in treating
     trachoma, and outcomes are good when the disease is treated promptly. In areas where this disease is common,
     large public health efforts are focused on reducing transmission by teaching people how to avoid the risks of the
     infection.

     SAFE Eradication of Trachoma

     Though uncommon in the United States and other developed nations, trachoma is the leading cause of preventable
     blindness worldwide, with more than 4 million people at immediate risk of blindness from trichiasis. The vast
     majority of those affected by trachoma live in Africa and the Middle East in isolated rural or desert communities with
     limited access to clean water and sanitation. These conditions provide an environment conducive to the growth and
     spread of Chlamydia trachomatis, the bacterium that causes trachoma, via wastewater and eye-seeking flies.
     In response to this crisis, recent years have seen major public health efforts aimed at treating and preventing
     trachoma. The Alliance for Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET 2020), coordinated by the World Health
     Organization (WHO), promotes an initiative dubbed "SAFE," which stands for "Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial
     cleanliness, and Environmental improvement." The Carter Center, a charitable, nongovernment organization led by
     former US President Jimmy Carter, has partnered with the WHO to promote the SAFE initiative in six of the most
     critically impacted nations in Africa. Through its Trachoma Control Program, the Carter Center trains and equips
     local surgeons to correct trichiasis and distributes antibiotics to treat trachoma. The program also promotes better
     personal hygiene through health education and improves sanitation by funding the construction of household
     latrines. This reduces the prevalence of open sewage, which provides breeding grounds for the flies that spread
     trachoma.

epidermidis and P. aeruginosa both adhere well to the surface of the lenses. Risk of infection can be greatly reduced
by proper care of contact lenses and avoiding wearing lenses overnight. Because the infection can quickly lead to

Biofilms and Infections of the Skin and Eyes

When treating bacterial infections of the skin and eyes, it is important to consider that few such infections can be
attributed to a single pathogen. While biofilms may develop in other parts of the body, they are especially relevant to
skin infections (such as those caused by S. aureus or P. aeruginosa) because of their prevalence in chronic skin
wounds. Biofilms develop when bacteria (and sometimes fungi) attach to a surface and produce extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) in which cells of multiple organisms may be embedded. When a biofilm develops on a
wound, it may interfere with the natural healing process as well as diagnosis and treatment.

Because biofilms vary in composition and are difficult to replicate in the lab, they are still not thoroughly understood.
The extracellular matrix of a biofilm consists of polymers such as polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, proteins, and
lipids, but the exact makeup varies. The organisms living within the extracellular matrix may include familiar
pathogens as well as other bacteria that do not grow well in cultures (such as numerous obligate anaerobes). This
presents challenges when culturing samples from infections that involve a biofilm. Because only some species grow
in vitro, the culture may contain only a subset of the bacterial species involved in the infection.

Biofilms confer many advantages to the resident bacteria. For example, biofilms can facilitate attachment to
surfaces on or in the host organism (such as wounds), inhibit phagocytosis, prevent the invasion of neutrophils, and
sequester host antibodies. Additionally, biofilms can provide a level of antibiotic resistance not found in the isolated
cells and colonies that are typical of laboratory cultures. The extracellular matrix provides a physical barrier to
antibiotics, shielding the target cells from exposure. Moreover, cells within a biofilm may differentiate to create
subpopulations of dormant cells called persister cells. Nutrient limitations deep within a biofilm add another level of
resistance, as stress responses can slow metabolism and increase drug resistance.

  Bacterial Infections of the Eyes

  A number of bacteria are able to cause infection when introduced to the mucosa of the eye. In general, bacterial
  eye infections can lead to inflammation, irritation, and discharge, but they vary in severity. Some are typically
  short-lived, and others can become chronic and lead to permanent eye damage. Prevention requires limiting
  exposure to contagious pathogens. When infections do occur, prompt treatment with antibiotics can often limit
  or prevent permanent damage. Figure 21.24 summarizes the characteristics of some common bacterial
  infections of the eyes.

     21.3 Viral Infections of the Skin and Eyes

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the most common viruses associated with infections of the skin and eyes
         · Compare the major characteristics of specific viral diseases affecting the skin and eyes

     Until recently, it was thought that the normal microbiota of the body consisted primarily of bacteria and some fungi.
     However, in addition to bacteria, the skin is colonized by viruses, and recent studies suggest that Papillomaviridae,
     Polyomaviridae and Circoviridae also contribute to the normal skin microbiota. However, some viruses associated
     with skin are pathogenic, and these viruses can cause diseases with a wide variety of presentations.

     Numerous types of viral infections cause rashes or lesions on the skin; however, in many cases these skin conditions
     result from infections that originate in other body systems. In this chapter, we will limit the discussion to viral skin
     infections that use the skin as a portal of entry. Later chapters will discuss viral infections such as chickenpox,
     measles, and rubella--diseases that cause skin rashes but invade the body through portals of entry other than the
     skin.

     Papillomas

     Papillomas (warts) are the expression of common skin infections by human papillomavirus (HPV) and are
     transmitted by direct contact. There are many types of HPV, and they lead to a variety of different presentations,
     such as common warts, plantar warts, flat warts, and filiform warts. HPV can also cause sexually-transmitted genital
     warts, which will be discussed in Urogenital System Infections. Vaccination is available for some strains of HPV.

     Common warts tend to develop on fingers, the backs of hands, and around nails in areas with broken skin. In
     contrast, plantar warts (also called foot warts) develop on the sole of the foot and can grow inwards, causing pain
     and pressure during walking. Flat warts can develop anywhere on the body, are often numerous, and are relatively
     smooth and small compared with other wart types. Filiform warts are long, threadlike warts that grow quickly.

     In some cases, the immune system may be strong enough to prevent warts from forming or to eradicate established

warts. However, treatment of established warts is typically required. There are many available treatments for warts,
and their effectiveness varies. Common warts can be frozen off with liquid nitrogen. Topical applications of salicylic
acid may also be effective. Other options are electrosurgery (burning), curettage (cutting), excision, painting with
cantharidin (which causes the wart to die so it can more easily be removed), laser treatments, treatment with
bleomycin, chemical peels, and immunotherapy (Figure 21.25).

FIGURE 21.25 Warts can vary in shape and in location. (a) Multiple plantar warts have grown on this toe. (b) A filiform wart has grown on

Oral Herpes

Another common skin virus is herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV has historically been divided into two types, HSV-1
and HSV-2. HSV-1 is typically transmitted by direct oral contact between individuals, and is usually associated with
oral herpes. HSV-2 is usually transmitted sexually and is typically associated with genital herpes. However, both
HSV-1 and HSV-2 are capable of infecting any mucous membrane, and the incidence of genital HSV-1 and oral
HSV-2 infections has been increasing in recent years. In this chapter, we will limit our discussion to infections
caused by HSV-1; HSV-2 and genital herpes will be discussed in Urogenital System Infections.
Infection by HSV-1 commonly manifests as cold sores or fever blisters, usually on or around the lips (Figure 21.26).
HSV-1 is highly contagious, with some studies suggesting that up to 65% of the US population is infected; however,
many infected individuals are asymptomatic.15 Moreover, the virus can be latent for long periods, residing in the
trigeminal nerve ganglia between recurring bouts of symptoms. Recurrence can be triggered by stress or
environmental conditions (systemic or affecting the skin). When lesions are present, they may blister, break open,
and crust. The virus can be spread through direct contact, even when a patient is asymptomatic.
While the lips, mouth, and face are the most common sites for HSV-1 infections, lesions can spread to other areas of
the body. Wrestlers and other athletes involved in contact sports may develop lesions on the neck, shoulders, and
trunk. This condition is often called herpes gladiatorum. Herpes lesions that develop on the fingers are often called
herpetic whitlow.
HSV-1 infections are commonly diagnosed from their appearance, although laboratory testing can confirm the
diagnosis. There is no cure, but antiviral medications such as acyclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are
used to reduce symptoms and risk of transmission. Topical medications, such as creams with n-docosanol and
penciclovir, can also be used to reduce symptoms such as itching, burning, and tingling.

     Roseola and Fifth Disease

     The viral diseases roseola and fifth disease are somewhat similar in terms of their presentation, but they are
     caused by different viruses. Roseola, sometimes called roseola infantum or exanthem subitum ("sudden rash"), is a
     mild viral infection usually caused by human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and occasionally by HHV-7. It is spread via
     direct contact with the saliva or respiratory secretions of an infected individual, often through droplet aerosols.
     Roseola is very common in children, with symptoms including a runny nose, a sore throat, and a cough, along with
     (or followed by) a high fever (39.4 ºC). About three to five days after the fever subsides, a rash may begin to appear
     on the chest and abdomen. The rash, which does not cause discomfort, initially forms characteristic macules that
     are flat or papules that are firm and slightly raised; some macules or papules may be surrounded by a white ring.
     The rash may eventually spread to the neck and arms, and sometimes continues to spread to the face and legs. The
     diagnosis is generally made based upon observation of the symptoms. However, it is possible to perform serological
     tests to confirm the diagnosis. While treatment may be recommended to control the fever, the disease usually
     resolves without treatment within a week after the fever develops. For individuals at particular risk, such as those
     who are immunocompromised, the antiviral medication ganciclovir may be used.
     Fifth disease (also known as erythema infectiosum) is another common, highly contagious illness that causes a
     distinct rash that is critical to diagnosis. Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19, and is transmitted by contact
     with respiratory secretions from an infected individual. Infection is more common in children than adults. While
     approximately 20% of individuals will be asymptomatic during infection,16 others will exhibit cold-like symptoms
     (headache, fever, and upset stomach) during the early stages when the illness is most infectious. Several days later,
     a distinct red facial rash appears, often called "slapped cheek" rash (Figure 21.27). Within a few days, a second rash
     may appear on the arms, legs, chest, back, or buttocks. The rash may come and go for several weeks, but usually
     disappears within seven to twenty-one days, gradually becoming lacy in appearance as it recedes.
     In children, the disease usually resolves on its own without medical treatment beyond symptom relief as needed.
     Adults may experience different and possibly more serious symptoms. Many adults with fifth disease do not develop
     any rash, but may experience joint pain and swelling that lasts several weeks or months. Immunocompromised
     individuals can develop severe anemia and may need blood transfusions or immune globulin injections. While the
     rash is the most important component of diagnosis (especially in children), the symptoms of fifth disease are not
     always consistent. Serological testing can be conducted for confirmation.

Viral Conjunctivitis

Like bacterial conjunctivitis viral infections of the eye can cause inflammation of the conjunctiva and discharge from
the eye. However, viral conjunctivitis tends to produce a discharge that is more watery than the thick discharge
associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. The infection is contagious and can easily spread from one eye to the other
or to other individuals through contact with eye discharge.

Viral conjunctivitis is commonly associated with colds caused by adenoviruses; however, other viruses can also
cause conjunctivitis. If the causative agent is uncertain, eye discharge can be tested to aid in diagnosis. Antibiotic
treatment of viral conjunctivitis is ineffective, and symptoms usually resolve without treatment within a week or two.

Herpes Keratitis
Herpes infections caused by HSV-1 can sometimes spread to the eye from other areas of the body, which may result
in keratoconjunctivitis. This condition, generally called herpes keratitis or herpetic keratitis, affects the conjunctiva
and cornea, causing irritation, excess tears, and sensitivity to light. Deep lesions in the cornea may eventually form,
leading to blindness. Because keratitis can have numerous causes, laboratory testing is necessary to confirm the
diagnosis when HSV-1 is suspected; once confirmed, antiviral medications may be prescribed.

  Viral Infections of the Skin and Eyes

  A number of viruses can cause infections via direct contact with skin and eyes, causing signs and symptoms
  ranging from rashes and lesions to warts and conjunctivitis. All of these viral diseases are contagious, and while
  some are more common in children (fifth disease and roseola), others are prevalent in people of all ages (oral
  herpes, viral conjunctivitis, papillomas). In general, the best means of prevention is avoiding contact with
  infected individuals. Treatment may require antiviral medications; however, several of these conditions are mild
  and typically resolve without treatment. Figure 21.28 summarizes the characteristics of some common viral
  infections of the skin and eyes.

     21.4 Mycoses of the Skin

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the most common fungal pathogens associated with cutaneous and subcutaneous mycoses
         · Compare the major characteristics of specific fungal diseases affecting the skin

     Many fungal infections of the skin involve fungi that are found in the normal skin microbiota. Some of these fungi can
     cause infection when they gain entry through a wound; others mainly cause opportunistic infections in
     immunocompromised patients. Other fungal pathogens primarily cause infection in unusually moist environments
     that promote fungal growth; for example, sweaty shoes, communal showers, and locker rooms provide excellent
     breeding grounds that promote the growth and transmission of fungal pathogens.

     Fungal infections, also called mycoses, can be divided into classes based on their invasiveness. Mycoses that cause
     superficial infections of the epidermis, hair, and nails, are called cutaneous mycoses. Mycoses that penetrate the
     epidermis and the dermis to infect deeper tissues are called subcutaneous mycoses. Mycoses that spread
     throughout the body are called systemic mycoses.

     Tineas

     A group of cutaneous mycoses called tineas are caused by dermatophytes, fungal molds that require keratin, a
     protein found in skin, hair, and nails, for growth. There are three genera of dermatophytes, all of which can cause
     cutaneous mycoses: Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum. Tineas on most areas of the body are
     generally called ringworm, but tineas in specific locations may have distinctive names and symptoms (see Table

21.3 and Figure 21.29). Keep in mind that these names--even though they are Latinized--refer to locations on the
body, not causative organisms. Tineas can be caused by different dermatophytes in most areas of the body.

Prevention; credit b: modification of work by Al Hasan M, Fitzgerald SM, Saoudian M, Krishnaswamy G)

Dermatophytes are commonly found in the environment and in soils and are frequently transferred to the skin via
contact with other humans and animals. Fungal spores can also spread on hair. Many dermatophytes grow well in
moist, dark environments. For example, tinea pedis (athlete's foot) commonly spreads in public showers, and the
causative fungi grow well in the dark, moist confines of sweaty shoes and socks. Likewise, tinea cruris (jock itch)
often spreads in communal living environments and thrives in warm, moist undergarments.

Tineas on the body (tinea corporis) often produce lesions that grow radially and heal towards the center. This
causes the formation of a red ring, leading to the misleading name of ringworm recall the Clinical Focus case in The
Eukaryotes of Microbiology.

Several approaches may be used to diagnose tineas. A Wood's lamp (also called a black lamp) with a wavelength of
365 nm is often used. When directed on a tinea, the ultraviolet light emitted from the Wood's lamp causes the fungal
elements (spores and hyphae) to fluoresce. Direct microscopic evaluation of specimens from skin scrapings, hair, or
nails can also be used to detect fungi. Generally, these specimens are prepared in a wet mount using a potassium
hydroxide solution (10%-20% aqueous KOH), which dissolves the keratin in hair, nails, and skin cells to allow for
visualization of the hyphae and fungal spores. The specimens may be grown on Sabouraud dextrose CC
(chloramphenicol/cyclohexamide), a selective agar that supports dermatophyte growth while inhibiting the growth
of bacteria and saprophytic fungi (Figure 21.30). Macroscopic colony morphology is often used to initially identify
the genus of the dermatophyte; identification can be further confirmed by visualizing the microscopic morphology
using either a slide culture or a sticky tape prep stained with lactophenol cotton blue.

Various antifungal treatments can be effective against tineas. Allylamine ointments that include terbinafine are
commonly used; miconazole and clotrimazole are also available for topical treatment, and griseofulvin is used orally.

     Cutaneous Aspergillosis

     Another cause of cutaneous mycoses is Aspergillus, a genus consisting of molds of many different species, some of
     which cause a condition called aspergillosis. Primary cutaneous aspergillosis, in which the infection begins in the
     skin, is rare but does occur. More common is secondary cutaneous aspergillosis, in which the infection begins in the
     respiratory system and disseminates systemically. Both primary and secondary cutaneous aspergillosis result in
     distinctive eschars that form at the site or sites of infection (Figure 21.31). Pulmonary aspergillosis will be discussed
     more thoroughly in Respiratory Mycoses).

     FIGURE 21.31 (a) Eschar on a patient with secondary cutaneous aspergillosis. (b) Micrograph showing a conidiophore of Aspergillus. (credit

     Primary cutaneous aspergillosis usually occurs at the site of an injury and is most often caused by Aspergillus
     fumigatus or Aspergillus flavus. It is usually reported in patients who have had an injury while working in an
     agricultural or outdoor environment. However, opportunistic infections can also occur in health-care settings, often
     at the site of intravenous catheters, venipuncture wounds, or in association with burns, surgical wounds, or
     occlusive dressing. After candidiasis, aspergillosis is the second most common hospital-acquired fungal infection

and often occurs in immunocompromised patients, who are more vulnerable to opportunistic infections.
Cutaneous aspergillosis is diagnosed using patient history, culturing, histopathology using a skin biopsy. Treatment
involves the use of antifungal medications such as voriconazole (preferred for invasive aspergillosis), itraconazole,
and amphotericin B if itraconazole is not effective. For immunosuppressed individuals or burn patients, medication
may be used and surgical or immunotherapy treatments may be needed.

Candidiasis of the Skin and Nails

Candida albicans and other yeasts in the genus Candida can cause skin infections referred to as cutaneous
candidiasis. Candida spp. are sometimes responsible for intertrigo, a general term for a rash that occurs in a skin
fold, or other localized rashes on the skin. Candida can also infect the nails, causing them to become yellow and
harden (Figure 21.32).

FIGURE 21.32 (a) This red, itchy rash is the result of cutaneous candidiasis, an opportunistic infection of the skin caused by the yeast
Candida albicans. (b) Fungal infections of the nail (tinea unguium) can be caused by dermatophytes or Candida spp. The nail becomes

agar. (credit a: modification of work by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; credit c: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention)

Candidiasis of the skin and nails is diagnosed through clinical observation and through culture, Gram stain, and KOH
wet mounts. Susceptibility testing for anti-fungal agents can also be done. Cutaneous candidiasis can be treated
with topical or systemic azole antifungal medications. Because candidiasis can become invasive, patients suffering
from HIV/AIDS, cancer, or other conditions that compromise the immune system may benefit from preventive
treatment. Azoles, such as clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole; nystatin;
terbinafine; and naftifine may be used for treatment. Long-term treatment with medications such as itraconazole or
ketoconazole may be used for chronic infections. Repeat infections often occur, but this risk can be reduced by
carefully following treatment recommendations, avoiding excessive moisture, maintaining good health, practicing
good hygiene, and having appropriate clothing (including footwear).

Candida also causes infections in other parts of the body besides the skin. These include vaginal yeast infections
(see Fungal Infections of the Reproductive System) and oral thrush (see Microbial Diseases of the Mouth and Oral
Cavity).

Sporotrichosis

Whereas cutaneous mycoses are superficial, subcutaneous mycoses can spread from the skin to deeper tissues. In
temperate regions, the most common subcutaneous mycosis is a condition called sporotrichosis, caused by the
856  21 · Skin and Eye Infections

     fungus Sporothrix schenkii and commonly known as rose gardener's disease or rose thorn disease (recall Case in
     Point: Every Rose Has Its Thorn). Sporotrichosis is often contracted after working with soil, plants, or timber, as the
     fungus can gain entry through a small wound such as a thorn-prick or splinter. Sporotrichosis can generally be
     avoided by wearing gloves and protective clothing while gardening and promptly cleaning and disinfecting any
     wounds sustained during outdoor activities.

     Sporothrix infections initially present as small ulcers in the skin, but the fungus can spread to the lymphatic system
     and sometimes beyond. When the infection spreads, nodules appear, become necrotic, and may ulcerate. As more
     lymph nodes become affected, abscesses and ulceration may develop over a larger area (often on one arm or hand).
     In severe cases, the infection may spread more widely throughout the body, although this is relatively uncommon.

     Sporothrix infection can be diagnosed based upon histologic examination of the affected tissue. Its macroscopic
     morphology can be observed by culturing the mold on potato dextrose agar, and its microscopic morphology can be
     observed by staining a slide culture with lactophenol cotton blue. Treatment with itraconazole is generally
     recommended.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify two parasites that commonly cause infections of the skin and eyes
    · Identify the major characteristics of specific parasitic diseases affecting the skin and eyes

Many parasitic protozoans and helminths use the skin or eyes as a portal of entry. Some may physically burrow into
the skin or the mucosa of the eye; others breach the skin barrier by means of an insect bite. Still others take
advantage of a wound to bypass the skin barrier and enter the body, much like other opportunistic pathogens.
Although many parasites enter the body through the skin, in this chapter we will limit our discussion to those for
which the skin or eyes are the primary site of infection. Parasites that enter through the skin but travel to a different
site of infection will be covered in other chapters. In addition, we will limit our discussion to microscopic parasitic
infections of the skin and eyes. Macroscopic parasites such as lice, scabies, mites, and ticks are beyond the scope of
this text.

Acanthamoeba Infections

Acanthamoeba is a genus of free-living protozoan amoebae that are common in soils and unchlorinated bodies of
fresh water. (This is one reason why some swimming pools are treated with chlorine.) The genus contains a few
parasitic species, some of which can cause infections of the eyes, skin, and nervous system. Such infections can
sometimes travel and affect other body systems. Skin infections may manifest as abscesses, ulcers, and nodules.
When acanthamoebae infect the eye, causing inflammation of the cornea, the condition is called Acanthamoeba
keratitis. Figure 21.34 illustrates the Acanthamoeba life cycle and various modes of infection.

While Acanthamoeba keratitis is initially mild, it can lead to severe corneal damage, vision impairment, or even
blindness if left untreated. Similar to eye infections involving P. aeruginosa, Acanthamoeba poses a much greater
risk to wearers of contact lenses because the amoeba can thrive in the space between contact lenses and the
cornea. Prevention through proper contact lens care is important. Lenses should always be properly disinfected
858  21 · Skin and Eye Infections

     prior to use, and should never be worn while swimming or using a hot tub.

     Acanthamoeba can also enter the body through other pathways, including skin wounds and the respiratory tract. It
     usually does not cause disease except in immunocompromised individuals; however, in rare cases, the infection can
     spread to the nervous system, resulting in a usually fatal condition called granulomatous amoebic encephalitis
     (GAE) (see Fungal and Parasitic Diseases of the Nervous System). Disseminated infections, lesions, and
     Acanthamoeba keratitis can be diagnosed by observing symptoms and examining patient samples under the
     microscope to view the parasite. Skin biopsies may be used.

     Acanthamoeba keratitis is difficult to treat, and prompt treatment is necessary to prevent the condition from
     progressing. The condition generally requires three to four weeks of intensive treatment to resolve. Common
     treatments include topical antiseptics (e.g., polyhexamethylene biguanide, chlorhexidine, or both), sometimes with
     painkillers or corticosteroids (although the latter are controversial because they suppress the immune system,
     which can worsen the infection). Azoles are sometimes prescribed as well. Advanced cases of keratitis may require
     a corneal transplant to prevent blindness.

     FIGURE 21.34 Acanthamoeba spp. are waterborne parasites very common in unchlorinated aqueous environments. As shown in this life
     cycle, Acanthamoeba cysts and trophozoites are both capable of entering the body through various routes, causing infections of the eye,

Loiasis

The helminth Loa loa, also known as the African eye worm, is a nematode that can cause loiasis, a disease endemic
to West and Central Africa (Figure 21.36). The disease does not occur outside that region except when carried by
travelers. There is evidence that individual genetic differences affect susceptibility to developing loiasis after
infection by the Loa loa worm. Even in areas in which Loa loa worms are common, the disease is generally found in
less than 30% of the population.17 It has been suggested that travelers who spend time in the region may be
somewhat more susceptible to developing symptoms than the native population, and the presentation of infection
may differ.18

The parasite is spread by deerflies (genus Chrysops), which can ingest the larvae from an infected human via a
blood meal (Figure 21.36). When the deerfly bites other humans, it deposits the larvae into their bloodstreams.
After about five months in the human body, some larvae develop into adult worms, which can grow to several
centimeters in length and live for years in the subcutaneous tissue of the host.

The name "eye worm" alludes to the visible migration of worms across the conjunctiva of the eye. Adult worms live
in the subcutaneous tissues and can travel at about 1 cm per hour. They can often be observed when migrating
through the eye, and sometimes under the skin; in fact, this is generally how the disease is diagnosed. It is also
possible to test for antibodies, but the presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate a current infection; it
only means that the individual was exposed at some time. Some patients are asymptomatic, but in others the
migrating worms can cause fever and areas of allergic inflammation known as Calabar swellings. Worms migrating
through the conjunctiva can cause temporary eye pain and itching, but generally there is no lasting damage to the
eye. Some patients experience a range of other symptoms, such as widespread itching, hives, and joint and muscle
pain.

Worms can be surgically removed from the eye or the skin, but this treatment only relieves discomfort; it does not
cure the infection, which involves many worms. The preferred treatment is diethylcarbamazine, but this medication
produces severe side effects in some individuals, such as brain inflammation and possible death in patients with
heavy infections. Albendazole is also sometimes used if diethylcarbamazine is not appropriate or not successful. If
left untreated for many years, loiasis can damage the kidneys, heart, and lungs, though these symptoms are rare.

INTRODUCTION The respiratory tract is one of the main portals of entry into the human body for microbial
pathogens. On average, a human takes about 20,000 breaths each day. This roughly corresponds to 10,000 liters, or
10 cubic meters, of air. Suspended within this volume of air are millions of microbes of terrestrial, animal, and
human origin--including many potential pathogens. A few of these pathogens will cause relatively mild infections
like sore throats and colds. Others, however, are less benign. According to the World Health Organization,
respiratory tract infections such as tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia were responsible for more than 4 million
deaths worldwide in 2012.1
At one time, it was thought that antimicrobial drugs and preventive vaccines might hold respiratory infections in
check in the developed world, but recent developments suggest otherwise. The rise of multiple-antibiotic resistance
in organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rendered many of our modern drugs ineffective. In addition, there
has been a recent resurgence in diseases like whooping cough and measles, once-common childhood illnesses
made rare by effective vaccines. Despite advances in medicine and public health programs, it is likely that
respiratory pathogens will remain formidable adversaries for the foreseeable future.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       John, a 65-year-old man with asthma and type 2 diabetes, works as a sales associate at a local home
       improvement store. Recently, he began to feel quite ill and made an appointment with his family physician. At
       the clinic, John reported experiencing headache, chest pain, coughing, and shortness of breath. Over the past
       day, he had also experienced some nausea and diarrhea. A nurse took his temperature and found that he was
       running a fever of 40 °C (104 °F).

       John suggested that he must have a case of influenza (flu), and regretted that he had put off getting his flu
       vaccine this year. After listening to John's breathing through a stethoscope, the physician ordered a chest
       radiography and collected blood, urine, and sputum samples.

     The primary function of the respiratory tract is to exchange gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) for metabolism.
     However, inhalation and exhalation (particularly when forceful) can also serve as a vehicle of transmission for
     pathogens between individuals.

     Anatomy of the Upper Respiratory System

     The respiratory system can be conceptually divided into upper and lower regions at the point of the epiglottis, the
     structure that seals off the lower respiratory system from the pharynx during swallowing (Figure 22.2). The upper
     respiratory system is in direct contact with the external environment. The nares (or nostrils) are the external
     openings of the nose that lead back into the nasal cavity, a large air-filled space behind the nares. These anatomical
     sites constitute the primary opening and first section of the respiratory tract, respectively. The nasal cavity is lined
     with hairs that trap large particles, like dust and pollen, and prevent their access to deeper tissues. The nasal cavity
     is also lined with a mucous membrane and Bowman's glands that produce mucus to help trap particles and
     microorganisms for removal. The nasal cavity is connected to several other air-filled spaces. The sinuses, a set of
     four, paired small cavities in the skull, communicate with the nasal cavity through a series of small openings. The
     nasopharynx is part of the upper throat extending from the posterior nasal cavity. The nasopharynx carries air
     inhaled through the nose. The middle ear is connected to the nasopharynx through the eustachian tube. The middle
     ear is separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane, or ear drum. And finally, the lacrimal glands drain
     to the nasal cavity through the nasolacrimal ducts (tear ducts). The open connections between these sites allow
     microorganisms to move from the nasal cavity to the sinuses, middle ears (and back), and down into the lower
     respiratory tract from the nasopharynx.

     The oral cavity is a secondary opening for the respiratory tract. The oral and nasal cavities connect through the
     fauces to the pharynx, or throat. The pharynx can be divided into three regions: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx,
     and the laryngopharynx. Air inhaled through the mouth does not pass through the nasopharynx; it proceeds first
     through the oropharynx and then through the laryngopharynx. The palatine tonsils, which consist of lymphoid
     tissue, are located within the oropharynx. The laryngopharynx, the last portion of the pharynx, connects to the
     larynx, which contains the vocal fold (Figure 22.2).

Anatomy of the Lower Respiratory System

The lower respiratory system begins below the epiglottis in the larynx or voice box (Figure 22.3). The trachea, or
windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube extending from the larynx that provides an unobstructed path for air to reach the
lungs. The trachea bifurcates into the left and right bronchi as it reaches the lungs. These paths branch repeatedly
to form smaller and more extensive networks of tubes, the bronchioles. The terminal bronchioles formed in this
tree-like network end in cul-de-sacs called the alveoli. These structures are surrounded by capillary networks and
are the site of gas exchange in the respiratory system. Human lungs contain on the order of 400,000,000 alveoli.
The outer surface of the lungs is protected with a double-layered pleural membrane. This structure protects the
lungs and provides lubrication to permit the lungs to move easily during respiration.

     Defenses of the Respiratory System

     The inner lining of the respiratory system consists of mucous membranes (Figure 22.4) and is protected by multiple
     immune defenses. The goblet cells within the respiratory epithelium secrete a layer of sticky mucus. The viscosity
     and acidity of this secretion inhibits microbial attachment to the underlying cells. In addition, the respiratory tract
     contains ciliated epithelial cells. The beating cilia dislodge and propel the mucus, and any trapped microbes, upward
     to the epiglottis, where they will be swallowed. Elimination of microbes in this manner is referred to as the
     mucociliary escalator effect and is an important mechanism that prevents inhaled microorganisms from migrating
     further into the lower respiratory tract.

The upper respiratory system is under constant surveillance by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT),
including the adenoids and tonsils. Other mucosal defenses include secreted antibodies (IgA), lysozyme, surfactant,
and antimicrobial peptides called defensins. Meanwhile, the lower respiratory tract is protected by alveolar
macrophages. These phagocytes efficiently kill any microbes that manage to evade the other defenses. The
combined action of these factors renders the lower respiratory tract nearly devoid of colonized microbes.

Normal Microbiota of the Respiratory System

The upper respiratory tract contains an abundant and diverse microbiota. The nasal passages and sinuses are
primarily colonized by members of the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The most common bacteria
identified include Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci (VGS), Corynebacterium spp.
(diphtheroids), Propionibacterium spp., and Haemophilus spp. The oropharynx includes many of the same isolates
as the nose and sinuses, with the addition of variable numbers of bacteria like species of Prevotella, Fusobacterium,
Moraxella, and Eikenella, as well as some Candida fungal isolates. In addition, many healthy humans
asymptomatically carry potential pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. As much as 20% of the population carry
Staphylococcus aureus in their nostrils.2 The pharynx, too, can be colonized with pathogenic strains of
Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Neisseria.

The lower respiratory tract, by contrast, is scantily populated with microbes. Of the organisms identified in the lower
respiratory tract, species of Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Veillonella are the most
common. It is not clear at this time if these small populations of bacteria constitute a normal microbiota or if they
are transients.

Many members of the respiratory system's normal microbiota are opportunistic pathogens. To proliferate and cause

     host damage, they first must overcome the immune defenses of respiratory tissues. Many mucosal pathogens
     produce virulence factors such as adhesins that mediate attachment to host epithelial cells, or polysaccharide
     capsules that allow microbes to evade phagocytosis. The endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria can stimulate a
     strong inflammatory response that damages respiratory cells. Other pathogens produce exotoxins, and still others
     have the ability to survive within the host cells. Once an infection of the respiratory tract is established, it tends to
     impair the mucociliary escalator, limiting the body's ability to expel the invading microbes, thus making it easier for
     pathogens to multiply and spread.

     Vaccines have been developed for many of the most serious bacterial and viral pathogens. Several of the most
     important respiratory pathogens and their vaccines, if available, are summarized in Table 22.1. Components of
     these vaccines will be explained later in the chapter.

Signs and Symptoms of Respiratory Infection

Microbial diseases of the respiratory system typically result in an acute inflammatory response. These infections can
be grouped by the location affected and have names ending in "itis", which literally means inflammation of. For
instance, rhinitis is an inflammation of the nasal cavities, often characteristic of the common cold. Rhinitis may also
be associated with hay fever allergies or other irritants. Inflammation of the sinuses is called sinusitis inflammation
of the ear is called otitis. Otitis media is an inflammation of the middle ear. A variety of microbes can cause
pharyngitis, commonly known as a sore throat. An inflammation of the larynx is called laryngitis. The resulting
inflammation may interfere with vocal cord function, causing voice loss. When tonsils are inflamed, it is called
tonsillitis. Chronic cases of tonsillitis may be treated surgically with tonsillectomy. More rarely, the epiglottis can be
infected, a condition called epiglottitis. In the lower respiratory system, the inflammation of the bronchial tubes
results in bronchitis. Most serious of all is pneumonia, in which the alveoli in the lungs are infected and become
inflamed. Pus and edema accumulate and fill the alveoli with fluids (called consolidations). This reduces the lungs'
ability to exchange gases and often results in a productive cough expelling phlegm and mucus. Cases of pneumonia
can range from mild to life-threatening, and remain an important cause of mortality in the very young and very old.

  CASE IN POINT

  Smoking-Associated Pneumonia

  Camila is a 22-year-old student who has been a chronic smoker for 5 years. Recently, she developed a
  persistent cough that has not responded to over-the-counter treatments. Her doctor ordered a chest radiograph
  to investigate. The radiological results were consistent with pneumonia. In addition, Streptococcus pneumoniae
  was isolated from Camila's sputum.

  Smokers are at a greater risk of developing pneumonia than the general population. Several components of
  tobacco smoke have been demonstrated to impair the lungs' immune defenses. These effects include disrupting
  the function of the ciliated epithelial cells, inhibiting phagocytosis, and blocking the action of antimicrobial
  peptides. Together, these lead to a dysfunction of the mucociliary escalator effect. The organisms trapped in the
  mucus are therefore able to colonize the lungs and cause infections rather than being expelled or swallowed.

22.2 Bacterial Infections of the Respiratory Tract

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common bacteria that can cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific bacterial diseases of the respiratory tract

The respiratory tract can be infected by a variety of bacteria, both gram positive and gram negative. Although the
diseases that they cause may range from mild to severe, in most cases, the microbes remain localized within the
respiratory system. Fortunately, most of these infections also respond well to antibiotic therapy.

Streptococcal Infections

A common upper respiratory infection, streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is caused by Streptococcus
pyogenes. This gram-positive bacterium appears as chains of cocci, as seen in Figure 22.5. Rebecca Lancefield
serologically classified streptococci in the 1930s using carbohydrate antigens from the bacterial cell walls. S.
pyogenes is the sole member of the Lancefield group A streptococci and is often referred to as GAS, or group A
strep.
874  22 · Respiratory System Infections

     FIGURE 22.5 This scanning electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes shows the characteristic cellular phenotype resembling chains
     of cocci. (credit: modification of work by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Medical Illustrator)

     Similar to streptococcal infections of the skin, the mucosal membranes of the pharynx are damaged by the release
     of a variety of exoenzymes and exotoxins by this extracellular pathogen. Many strains of S. pyogenes can degrade
     connective tissues by using hyaluronidase, collagenase and streptokinase. Streptokinase activates plasmin, which
     leads to degradation of fibrin and, in turn, dissolution of blood clots, which assists in the spread of the pathogen.
     Released toxins include streptolysins that can destroy red and white blood cells. The classic signs of streptococcal
     pharyngitis are a fever higher than 38 °C (100.4 °F); intense pharyngeal pain; erythema associated with pharyngeal
     inflammation; and swollen, dark-red palatine tonsils, often dotted with patches of pus; and petechiae
     (microcapillary hemorrhages) on the soft or hard palate (roof of the mouth) (Figure 22.6). The submandibular lymph
     nodes beneath the angle of the jaw are also often swollen during strep throat.
     Some strains of group A streptococci produce erythrogenic toxin. This exotoxin is encoded by a temperate
     bacteriophage (bacterial virus) and is an example of phage conversion (see The Viral Life Cycle). The toxin attacks
     the plasma membranes of capillary endothelial cells and leads to scarlet fever (or scarlatina), a disseminated fine
     red rash on the skin, and strawberry tongue, a red rash on the tongue (Figure 22.6). Severe cases may even lead to
     streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which results from massive superantigen production that leads to septic
     shock and death.
     S. pyogenes can be easily spread by direct contact or droplet transmission through coughing and sneezing. The
     disease can be diagnosed quickly using a rapid enzyme immunoassay for the group A antigen. However, due to a
     significant rate of false-negative results (up to 30%4 ), culture identification is still the gold standard to confirm
     pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes. S. pyogenes can be identified as a catalase-negative, beta hemolytic bacterium that
     is susceptible to 0.04 units of bacitracin. Antibiotic resistance is limited for this bacterium, so most -lactams
     remain effective; oral amoxicillin and intramuscular penicillin G are those most commonly prescribed.

Sequelae of S. pyogenes Infections
One reason strep throat infections are aggressively treated with antibiotics is because they can lead to serious
sequelae, later clinical consequences of a primary infection. It is estimated that 1%-3% of untreated S. pyogenes
infections can be followed by nonsuppurative (without the production of pus) sequelae that develop 1-3 weeks
after the acute infection has resolved. Two such sequelae are acute rheumatic fever and acute
glomerulonephritis.

Acute rheumatic fever can follow pharyngitis caused by specific rheumatogenic strains of S. pyogenes (strains 1, 3,
5, 6, and 18). Although the exact mechanism responsible for this sequela remains unclear, molecular mimicry
between the M protein of rheumatogenic strains of S. pyogenes and heart tissue is thought to initiate the
autoimmune attack. The most serious and lethal clinical manifestation of rheumatic fever is damage to and
inflammation of the heart (carditis). Acute glomerulonephritis also results from an immune response to
streptococcal antigens following pharyngitis and cutaneous infections. Acute glomerulonephritis develops within
6-10 days after pharyngitis, but can take up to 21 days after a cutaneous infection. Similar to acute rheumatic fever,
there are strong associations between specific nephritogenic strains of S. pyogenes and acute glomerulonephritis,
and evidence suggests a role for antigen mimicry and autoimmunity. However, the primary mechanism of acute
glomerulonephritis appears to be the formation of immune complexes between S. pyogenes antigens and
antibodies, and their deposition between endothelial cells of the glomeruli of kidney. Inflammatory response
against the immune complexes leads to damage and inflammation of the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis).

Acute Otitis Media

An infection of the middle ear is called acute otitis media (AOM), but often it is simply referred to as an earache.
The condition is most common between ages 3 months and 3 years. In the United States, AOM is the second-
leading cause of visits to pediatricians by children younger than age 5 years, and it is the leading indication for
antibiotic prescription.5

AOM is characterized by the formation and accumulation of pus in the middle ear. Unable to drain, the pus builds up,
resulting in moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane and otalgia (ear pain). Inflammation resulting

     from the infection leads to swelling of the eustachian tubes, and may also lead to fever, nausea, vomiting, and
     diarrhea, particularly in infants. Infants and toddlers who cannot yet speak may exhibit nonverbal signs suggesting
     AOM, such as holding, tugging, or rubbing of the ear, as well as uncharacteristic crying or distress in response to the
     pain.

     AOM can be caused by a variety of bacteria. Among neonates, S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of AOM,
     but Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and group B Streptococcus species can also be involved. In older infants
     and children younger than 14 years old, the most common bacterial causes are S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus
     influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Among S. pneumoniae infections, encapsulated strains are frequent causes of
     AOM. By contrast, the strains of H. influenzae and M. cattarhalis that are responsible for AOM do not possess a
     capsule. Rather than direct tissue damage by these pathogens, bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide
     (LPS) in gram-negative pathogens induce an inflammatory response that causes swelling, pus, and tissue damage
     within the middle ear (Figure 22.7).

     Any blockage of the eustachian tubes, with or without infection, can cause fluid to become trapped and accumulate
     in the middle ear. This is referred to as otitis media with effusion (OME). The accumulated fluid offers an excellent
     reservoir for microbial growth and, consequently, secondary bacterial infections often ensue. This can lead to
     recurring and chronic earaches, which are especially common in young children. The higher incidence in children
     can be attributed to many factors. Children have more upper respiratory infections, in general, and their eustachian
     tubes are also shorter and drain at a shallower angle. Young children also tend to spend more time lying down than
     adults, which facilitates drainage from the nasopharynx through the eustachian tube and into the middle ear. Bottle
     feeding while lying down enhances this risk because the sucking action on the bottle causes negative pressure to
     build up within the eustachian tube, promoting the movement of fluid and bacteria from the nasopharynx.

     Diagnosis is typically made based on clinical signs and symptoms, without laboratory testing to determine the
     specific causative agent. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for the treatment of AOM. High-dose amoxicillin is the
     first-line drug, but with increasing resistance concerns, macrolides and cephalosporins may also be used. The
     pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) contains serotypes that are important causes of AOM, and vaccination
     has been shown to decrease the incidence of AOM. Vaccination against influenza has also been shown to decrease
     the risk for AOM, likely because viral infections like influenza predispose patients to secondary infections with S.
     pneumoniae. Although there is a conjugate vaccine available for the invasive serotype B of H. influenzae, this
     vaccine does not impact the incidence of H. influenzae AOM. Because unencapsulated strains of H. influenzae and
     M. catarrhalis are involved in AOM, vaccines against bacterial cellular factors other than capsules will need to be
     developed.

Bacterial Rhinosinusitis
The microbial community of the nasopharynx is extremely diverse and harbors many opportunistic pathogens, so it
is perhaps not surprising that infections leading to rhinitis and sinusitis have many possible causes. These
conditions often occur as secondary infections after a viral infection, which effectively compromises the immune
defenses and allows the opportunistic bacteria to establish themselves. Bacterial sinusitis involves infection and
inflammation within the paranasal sinuses. Because bacterial sinusitis rarely occurs without rhinitis, the preferred
term is rhinosinusitis. The most common causes of bacterial rhinosinusitis are similar to those for AOM, including S.
pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis.

Diphtheria

The causative agent of diphtheria, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, is a club-shaped, gram-positive rod that belongs
to the phylum Actinobacteria. Diphtheroids are common members of the normal nasopharyngeal microbiota.
However, some strains of C. diphtheriae become pathogenic because of the presence of a temperate bacteriophage-
encoded protein--the diphtheria toxin. Diphtheria is typically a respiratory infection of the oropharynx but can also
cause impetigo-like lesions on the skin. Although the disease can affect people of all ages, it tends to be most
severe in those younger than 5 years or older than 40 years. Like strep throat, diphtheria is commonly transmitted in
the droplets and aerosols produced by coughing. After colonizing the throat, the bacterium remains in the oral cavity
and begins producing the diphtheria toxin. This protein is an A-B toxin that blocks host-cell protein synthesis by
inactivating elongation factor (EF)-2 (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens). The toxin's action
leads to the death of the host cells and an inflammatory response. An accumulation of grayish exudate consisting of
dead host cells, pus, red blood cells, fibrin, and infectious bacteria results in the formation of a pseudomembrane.
The pseudomembrane can cover mucous membranes of the nasal cavity, tonsils, pharynx, and larynx (Figure 22.8).
This is a classic sign of diphtheria. As the disease progresses, the pseudomembrane can enlarge to obstruct the
fauces of the pharynx or trachea and can lead to suffocation and death. Sometimes, intubation, the placement of a
breathing tube in the trachea, is required in advanced infections. If the diphtheria toxin spreads throughout the
body, it can damage other tissues as well. This can include myocarditis (heart damage) and nerve damage that may
impair breathing.

     blood cells, and infectious microbes. (credit: modification of work by Putnong N, Agustin G, Pasubillo M, Miyagi K, Dimaano EM)

     The presumptive diagnosis of diphtheria is primarily based on the clinical symptoms (i.e., the pseudomembrane)
     and vaccination history, and is typically confirmed by identifying bacterial cultures obtained from throat swabs. The
     diphtheria toxin itself can be directly detected in vitro using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based, direct
     detection systems for the diphtheria tox gene, and immunological techniques like radial immunodiffusion or Elek's
     immunodiffusion test.
     Broad-spectrum antibiotics like penicillin and erythromycin tend to effectively control C. diphtheriae infections.
     Regrettably, they have no effect against preformed toxins. If toxin production has already occurred in the patient,
     antitoxins (preformed antibodies against the toxin) are administered. Although this is effective in neutralizing the
     toxin, the antitoxins may lead to serum sickness because they are produced in horses (see Hypersensitivities).
     Widespread vaccination efforts have reduced the occurrence of diphtheria worldwide. There are currently four
     combination toxoid vaccines available that provide protection against diphtheria and other diseases: DTaP, Tdap, DT,
     and Td. In all cases, the letters "d," "t," and "p" stand for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, respectively; the "a"
     stands for acellular. If capitalized, the letters indicate a full-strength dose; lowercase letters indicate reduced
     dosages. According to current recommendations, children should receive five doses of the DTaP vaccine in their
     youth and a Td booster every 10 years. Children with adverse reactions to the pertussis vaccine may be given the DT
     vaccine in place of the DTaP.

Bacterial Pneumonia

Pneumonia is a general term for infections of the lungs that lead to inflammation and accumulation of fluids and
white blood cells in the alveoli. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, although
the vast majority of pneumonias are bacterial in origin. Bacterial pneumonia is a prevalent, potentially serious
infection; it caused more 50,000 deaths in the United States in 2014.6 As the alveoli fill with fluids and white blood
cells (consolidation), air exchange becomes impaired and patients experience respiratory distress (Figure 22.9). In
addition, pneumonia can lead to pleurisy, an infection of the pleural membrane surrounding the lungs, which can
make breathing very painful. Although many different bacteria can cause pneumonia under the right circumstances,
three bacterial species cause most clinical cases: Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae. In addition to these, we will also examine some of the less common causes of pneumonia.

Pneumococcal Pneumonia
The most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This gram-
positive, alpha hemolytic streptococcus is commonly found as part of the normal microbiota of the human
respiratory tract. The cells tend to be somewhat lancet-shaped and typically appear as pairs (Figure 22.10). The
pneumococci initially colonize the bronchioles of the lungs. Eventually, the infection spreads to the alveoli, where
the microbe's polysaccharide capsule interferes with phagocytic clearance. Other virulence factors include
autolysins like Lyt A, which degrade the microbial cell wall, resulting in cell lysis and the release of cytoplasmic
virulence factors. One of these factors, pneumolysin O, is important in disease progression; this pore-forming
protein damages host cells, promotes bacterial adherence, and enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
The resulting inflammatory response causes the alveoli to fill with exudate rich in neutrophils and red blood cells. As
a consequence, infected individuals develop a productive cough with bloody sputum.

     Disease Control and Prevention; credit b: modification of work by Janice Carr, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Pneumococci can be presumptively identified by their distinctive gram-positive, lancet-shaped cell morphology and
     diplococcal arrangement. In blood agar cultures, the organism demonstrates alpha hemolytic colonies that are
     autolytic after 24 to 48 hours. In addition, S. pneumoniae is extremely sensitive to optochin and colonies are rapidly
     destroyed by the addition of 10% solution of sodium deoxycholate. All clinical pneumococcal isolates are serotyped
     using the quellung reaction with typing antisera produced by the CDC. Positive quellung reactions are considered
     definitive identification of pneumococci.
     Antibiotics remain the mainstay treatment for pneumococci. -Lactams like penicillin are the first-line drugs, but
     resistance to -lactams is a growing problem. When -lactam resistance is a concern, macrolides and
     fluoroquinolones may be prescribed. However, S. pneumoniae resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones is
     increasing as well, limiting the therapeutic options for some infections. There are currently two pneumococcal
     vaccines available: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).
     These are generally given to the most vulnerable populations of individuals: children younger than 2 years and
     adults older than 65 years.
     Haemophilus Pneumonia
     Encapsulated strains of Haemophilus influenzae are known for causing meningitis, but nonencapsulated strains are
     important causes of pneumonia. This small, gram-negative coccobacillus is found in the pharynx of the majority of
     healthy children; however, Haemophilus pneumonia is primarily seen in the elderly. Like other pathogens that cause
     pneumonia, H. influenzae is spread by droplets and aerosols produced by coughing. A fastidious organism, H.
     influenzae will only grow on media with available factor X (hemin) and factor V (NAD), like chocolate agar (Figure
     22.11). Serotyping must be performed to confirm identity of H. influenzae isolates.
     Infections of the alveoli by H. influenzae result in inflammation and accumulation of fluids. Increasing resistance to
     -lactams, macrolides, and tetracyclines presents challenges for the treatment of Haemophilus pneumonia.
     Resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare among isolates of H. influenzae but has been observed. As discussed for
     AOM, a vaccine directed against nonencapsulated H. influenzae, if developed, would provide protection against
     pneumonia caused by this pathogen.

  CASE IN POINT

  Why Me?

  Tracy is a 6-year old who developed a serious cough that would not seem to go away. After 2 weeks, her parents
  became concerned and took her to the pediatrician, who suspected a case of bacterial pneumonia. Tests
  confirmed that the cause was Haemophilus influenzae. Fortunately, Tracy responded well to antibiotic treatment
  and eventually made a full recovery.

  Because there had been several other cases of bacterial pneumonia at Tracy's elementary school, local health
  officials urged parents to have their children screened. Of the children who were screened, it was discovered
  that greater than 50% carried H. influenzae in their nasal cavities, yet all but two of them were asymptomatic.

  Why is it that some individuals become seriously ill from bacterial infections that seem to have little or no effect
  on others? The pathogenicity of an organism--its ability to cause host damage--is not solely a property of the
  microorganism. Rather, it is the product of a complex relationship between the microbe's virulence factors and
  the immune defenses of the individual. Preexisting conditions and environmental factors such as exposure to
  secondhand smoke can make some individuals more susceptible to infection by producing conditions favorable
  to microbial growth or compromising the immune system. In addition, individuals may have genetically
  determined immune factors that protect them--or not--from particular strains of pathogens. The interactions
  between these host factors and the pathogenicity factors produced by the microorganism ultimately determine
  the outcome of the infection. A clearer understanding of these interactions may allow for better identification of
  at-risk individuals and prophylactic interventions in the future.

Mycoplasma Pneumonia (Walking Pneumonia)
Primary atypical pneumonia is caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This bacterium is not part of the respiratory
tract's normal microbiota and can cause epidemic disease outbreaks. Also known as walking pneumonia,
mycoplasma pneumonia infections are common in crowded environments like college campuses and military
bases. It is spread by aerosols formed when coughing or sneezing. The disease is often mild, with a low fever and
persistent cough. These bacteria, which do not have cell walls, use a specialized attachment organelle to bind to
ciliated cells. In the process, epithelial cells are damaged and the proper function of the cilia is hindered (Figure
22.12).

Mycoplasma grow very slowly when cultured. Therefore, penicillin and thallium acetate are added to agar to prevent
the overgrowth by faster-growing potential contaminants. Since M. pneumoniae does not have a cell wall, it is
resistant to these substances. Without a cell wall, the microbial cells appear pleomorphic. M. pneumoniae infections
tend to be self-limiting but may also respond well to macrolide antibiotic therapy. -lactams, which target cell wall
882  22 · Respiratory System Infections

     synthesis, are not indicated for treatment of infections with this pathogen.

     of an infected hamster. (credit: modification of work by American Society for Microbiology)

     Chlamydial Pneumonias and Psittacosis
     Chlamydial pneumonia can be caused by three different species of bacteria: Chlamydophila pneumoniae (formerly
     known as Chlamydia pneumoniae), Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci), and Chlamydia
     trachomatis. All three are obligate intracellular pathogens and cause mild to severe pneumonia and bronchitis. Of
     the three, Chlamydophila pneumoniae is the most common and is transmitted via respiratory droplets or aerosols.
     C. psittaci causes psittacosis, a zoonotic disease that primarily affects domesticated birds such as parakeets,
     turkeys, and ducks, but can be transmitted from birds to humans. Psittacosis is a relatively rare infection and is
     typically found in people who work with birds. Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of the sexually
     transmitted disease chlamydia, can cause pneumonia in infants when the infection is passed from a person giving
     birth to a baby.

     Diagnosis of chlamydia by culturing tends to be difficult and slow. Because they are intracellular pathogens, they
     require multiple passages through tissue culture. Recently, a variety of PCR- and serologically based tests have been
     developed to enable easier identification of these pathogens. Tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics are typically
     prescribed for treatment.

     Health Care-Associated Pneumonia
     A variety of opportunistic bacteria that do not typically cause respiratory disease in healthy individuals are common
     causes of health care-associated pneumonia. These include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and
     proteobacteria such as species of Escherichia, Proteus, and Serratia. Patients at risk include the elderly, those who
     have other preexisting lung conditions, and those who are immunocompromised. In addition, patients receiving
     supportive therapies such as intubation, antibiotics, and immunomodulatory drugs may also be at risk because
     these interventions disrupt the mucociliary escalator and other pulmonary defenses. Invasive medical devices such
     as catheters, medical implants, and ventilators can also introduce opportunistic pneumonia-causing pathogens into
     the body.7

     Pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae is characterized by lung necrosis and "currant jelly sputum," so named
     because it consists of clumps of blood, mucus, and debris from the thick polysaccharide capsule produced by the
     bacterium. K. pneumoniae is often multidrug resistant. Aminoglycoside and cephalosporin are often prescribed but
     are not always effective. Klebsiella pneumonia is frequently fatal even when treated.

Pseudomonas Pneumonia
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is another opportunistic pathogen that can cause serious cases of bacterial pneumonia in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and hospitalized patients assisted with artificial ventilators. This bacterium is
extremely antibiotic resistant and can produce a variety of exotoxins. Ventilator-associated pneumonia with P.
aeruginosa is caused by contaminated equipment that causes the pathogen to be aspirated into the lungs. In
patients with CF, a genetic defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor (CFTR) leads to the accumulation of
excess dried mucus in the lungs. This decreases the effectiveness of the defensins and inhibits the mucociliary
escalator. P. aeruginosa is known to infect more than half of all patients with CF. It adapts to the conditions in the
patient's lungs and begins to produce alginate, a viscous exopolysaccharide that inhibits the mucociliary escalator.
Lung damage from the chronic inflammatory response that ensues is the leading cause of mortality in patients with
CF.8

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in human history. Although tuberculosis infection rates
in the United States are extremely low, the CDC estimates that about one-third of the world's population is infected
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causal organism of TB, with 9.6 million new TB cases and 1.5 million deaths
worldwide in 2014.9

M. tuberculosis is an acid-fast, high G + C, gram-positive, nonspore-forming rod. Its cell wall is rich in waxy mycolic
acids, which make the cells impervious to polar molecules. It also causes these organisms to grow slowly. M.
tuberculosis causes a chronic granulomatous disease that can infect any area of the body, although it is typically
associated with the lungs. M. tuberculosis is spread by inhalation of respiratory droplets or aerosols from an
infected person. The infectious dose of M. tuberculosis is only 10 cells.10

After inhalation, the bacteria enter the alveoli (Figure 22.13). The cells are phagocytized by macrophages but can
survive and multiply within these phagocytes because of the protection by the waxy mycolic acid in their cell walls.
If not eliminated by macrophages, the infection can progress, causing an inflammatory response and an
accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the area. Several weeks or months may pass before an
immunological response is mounted by T cells and B cells. Eventually, the lesions in the alveoli become walled off,
forming small round lesions called tubercles. Bacteria continue to be released into the center of the tubercles and

     the chronic immune response results in tissue damage and induction of apoptosis (programmed host-cell death) in
     a process called liquefaction. This creates a caseous center, or air pocket, where the aerobic M. tuberculosis can
     grow and multiply. Tubercles may eventually rupture and bacterial cells can invade pulmonary capillaries; from
     there, bacteria can spread through the bloodstream to other organs, a condition known as miliary tuberculosis. The
     rupture of tubercles also facilitates transmission of the bacteria to other individuals via droplet aerosols that exit the
     body in coughs. Because these droplets can be very small and stay aloft for a long time, special precautions are
     necessary when caring for patients with TB, such as the use of face masks and negative-pressure ventilation and
     filtering systems.

     Eventually, most lesions heal to form calcified Ghon complexes. These structures are visible on chest radiographs
     and are a useful diagnostic feature. But even after the disease has apparently ended, viable bacteria remain
     sequestered in these locations. Release of these organisms at a later time can produce reactivation tuberculosis
     (or secondary TB). This is mainly observed in people with alcoholism, the elderly, or in otherwise
     immunocompromised individuals (Figure 22.13).

     FIGURE 22.13 In the infectious cycle of tuberculosis, the immune response of most infected individuals (approximately 90%) results in the
     formation of tubercles in which the infection is walled off.11 The remainder will suffer progressive primary tuberculosis. The sequestered
     bacteria may be reactivated to form secondary tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients at a later time. (credit: modification of work

Because TB is a chronic disease, chemotherapeutic treatments often continue for months or years. Multidrug
resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains of M. tuberculosis are a growing clinical
concern. These strains can arise due to misuse or mismanagement of antibiotic therapies. Therefore, it is imperative
that proper multidrug protocols are used to treat these infections. Common antibiotics included in these mixtures
are isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.

A TB vaccine is available that is based on the so-called bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) strain of M. bovis commonly
found in cattle. In the United States, the BCG vaccine is only given to health-care workers and members of the
military who are at risk of exposure to active cases of TB. It is used more broadly worldwide. Many individuals born
in other countries have been vaccinated with BCG strain. BCG is used in many countries with a high prevalence of
TB, to prevent childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary disease.

The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (Figure 22.14) is regularly used in the United States to screen for potential TB
exposure (see Hypersensitivities). However, prior vaccinations with the BCG vaccine can cause false-positive
results. Chest radiographs to detect Ghon complex formation are required, therefore, to confirm exposure.

Pertussis (Whooping Cough)

The causative agent of pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, is Bordetella pertussis, a gram-negative
coccobacillus. The disease is characterized by mucus accumulation in the lungs that leads to a long period of severe
coughing. Sometimes, following a bout of coughing, a sound resembling a "whoop" is produced as air is inhaled
through the inflamed and restricted airway--hence the name whooping cough. Although adults can be infected, the
symptoms of this disease are most pronounced in infants and children. Pertussis is highly communicable through
droplet transmission, so the uncontrollable coughing produced is an efficient means of transmitting the disease in a
susceptible population.
Following inhalation, B. pertussis specifically attaches to epithelial cells using an adhesin, filamentous

886  22 · Respiratory System Infections

     hemagglutinin. The bacteria then grow at the site of infection and cause disease symptoms through the production
     of exotoxins. One of the main virulence factors of this organism is an A-B exotoxin called the pertussis toxin (PT).
     When PT enters the host cells, it increases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and disrupts cellular
     signaling. PT is known to enhance inflammatory responses involving histamine and serotonin. In addition to PT, B.
     pertussis produces a tracheal cytotoxin that damages ciliated epithelial cells and results in accumulation of mucus
     in the lungs. The mucus can support the colonization and growth of other microbes and, as a consequence,
     secondary infections are common. Together, the effects of these factors produce the cough that characterizes this
     infection.

     A pertussis infection can be divided into three distinct stages. The initial infection, termed the catarrhal stage, is
     relatively mild and unremarkable. The signs and symptoms may include nasal congestion, a runny nose, sneezing,
     and a low-grade fever. This, however, is the stage in which B. pertussis is most infectious. In the paroxysmal stage,
     mucus accumulation leads to uncontrollable coughing spasms that can last for several minutes and frequently
     induce vomiting. The paroxysmal stage can last for several weeks. A long convalescence stage follows the
     paroxysmal stage, during which time patients experience a chronic cough that can last for up to several months. In
     fact, the disease is sometimes called the 100-day cough.

     In infants, coughing can be forceful enough to cause fractures to the ribs, and prolonged infections can lead to
     death. The CDC reported 20 pertussis-related deaths in 2012,12 but that number had declined to five by 2015.13

     During the first 2 weeks of infection, laboratory diagnosis is best performed by culturing the organism directly from a
     nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen collected from the posterior nasopharynx. The NP specimen is streaked onto
     Bordet-Gengou medium. The specimens must be transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible, even if
     transport media are used. Transport times of longer than 24 hours reduce the viability of B. pertussis significantly.

     Within the first month of infection, B. pertussis can be diagnosed using PCR techniques. During the later stages of
     infection, pertussis-specific antibodies can be immunologically detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
     assay (ELISA).

     Pertussis is generally a self-limiting disease. Antibiotic therapy with erythromycin or tetracycline is only effective at
     the very earliest stages of disease. Antibiotics given later in the infection, and prophylactically to uninfected
     individuals, reduce the rate of transmission. Active vaccination is a better approach to control this disease. The DPT
     vaccine was once in common use in the United States. In that vaccine, the P component consisted of killed whole-
     cell B. pertussis preparations. Because of some adverse effects, that preparation has now been superseded by the
     DTaP and Tdap vaccines. In both of these new vaccines, the "aP" component is a pertussis toxoid.

     Widespread vaccination has greatly reduced the number of reported cases and prevented large epidemics of
     pertussis. Recently, however, pertussis has begun to reemerge as a childhood disease in some states because of
     declining vaccination rates and an increasing population of susceptible children.

Legionnaires Disease

An atypical pneumonia called Legionnaires disease (also known as legionellosis) is caused by an aerobic gram-
negative bacillus, Legionella pneumophila. This bacterium infects free-living amoebae that inhabit moist
environments, and infections typically occur from human-made reservoirs such as air-conditioning cooling towers,
humidifiers, misting systems, and fountains. Aerosols from these reservoirs can lead to infections of susceptible
individuals, especially those suffering from chronic heart or lung disease or other conditions that weaken the
immune system.

When L. pneumophila bacteria enter the alveoli, they are phagocytized by resident macrophages. However, L.
pneumophila uses a secretion system to insert proteins in the endosomal membrane of the macrophage; these
proteins prevent lysosomal fusion, allowing L. pneumophila to continue to proliferate within the phagosome. The
resulting respiratory disease can range from mild to severe pneumonia, depending on the status of the host's
immune defenses. Although this disease primarily affects the lungs, it can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting,
confusion, and other neurological effects.

Diagnosis of Legionnaires disease is somewhat complicated. L. pneumophila is a fastidious bacterium and is difficult
to culture. In addition, since the bacterial cells are not efficiently stained with the Gram stain, other staining
techniques, such as the Warthin-Starry silver-precipitate procedure, must be used to visualize this pathogen. A rapid
diagnostic test has been developed that detects the presence of Legionella antigen in a patient's urine; results take
less than 1 hour, and the test has high selectivity and specificity (greater than 90%). Unfortunately, the test only
works for one serotype of L. pneumophila (type 1, the serotype responsible for most infections). Consequently,
isolation and identification of L. pneumophila from sputum remains the defining test for diagnosis.

Once diagnosed, Legionnaire disease can be effectively treated with fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics.
However, the disease is sometimes fatal; about 10% of patients die of complications.14 There is currently no
vaccine available.

Q Fever

The zoonotic disease Q fever is caused by a rickettsia, Coxiella burnetii. The primary reservoirs for this bacterium
are domesticated livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The bacterium may be transmitted by ticks or through
exposure to the urine, feces, milk, or amniotic fluid of an infected animal. In humans, the primary route of infection
is through inhalation of contaminated farmyard aerosols. It is, therefore, largely an occupational disease of farmers.
Humans are acutely sensitive to C. burnetii--the infective dose is estimated to be just a few cells.15 In addition, the
organism is hardy and can survive in a dry environment for an extended time. Symptoms associated with acute Q
fever include high fever, headache, coughing, pneumonia, and general malaise. In a small number of patients (less
than 5%16 ), the condition may become chronic, often leading to endocarditis, which may be fatal.

Diagnosing rickettsial infection by cultivation in the laboratory is both difficult and hazardous because of the easy
aerosolization of the bacteria, so PCR and ELISA are commonly used. Doxycycline is the first-line drug to treat acute
Q fever. In chronic Q fever, doxycycline is often paired with hydroxychloroquine.

     Bacterial Diseases of the Respiratory Tract

     Numerous pathogens can cause infections of the respiratory tract. Many of these infections produce similar
     signs and symptoms, but appropriate treatment depends on accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing. The
     tables in Figure 22.15 and Figure 22.16 summarize the most important bacterial respiratory infections, with the
     latter focusing specifically on forms of bacterial pneumonia.

890  22 · Respiratory System Infections

     Viruses are the most frequent cause of respiratory tract infections. Unlike the bacterial pathogens, we have few
     effective therapies to combat viral respiratory infections. Fortunately, many of these diseases are mild and self-
     limiting. A few respiratory infections manifest their primary symptoms at other locations in the body.

     The Common Cold

     The common cold is a generic term for a variety of mild viral infections of the nasal cavity. More than 200 different
     viruses are known to cause the common cold. The most common groups of cold viruses include rhinoviruses,
     coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. These infections are widely disseminated in the human population and are
     transmitted through direct contact and droplet transmission. Coughing and sneezing efficiently produce infectious
     aerosols, and rhinoviruses are known to persist on environmental surfaces for up to a week.17

     Viral contact with the nasal mucosa or eyes can lead to infection. Rhinoviruses tend to replicate best between 33 °C
     (91.4 °F) and 35 °C (95 °F), somewhat below normal body temperature (37 °C [98.6 °F]). As a consequence, they
     tend to infect the cooler tissues of the nasal cavities. Colds are marked by an irritation of the mucosa that leads to
     an inflammatory response. This produces common signs and symptoms such as nasal excess nasal secretions
     (runny nose), congestion, sore throat, coughing, and sneezing. The absence of high fever is typically used to
     differentiate common colds from other viral infections, like influenza. Some colds may progress to cause otitis
     media, pharyngitis, or laryngitis, and patients may also experience headaches and body aches. The disease,
     however, is self-limiting and typically resolves within 1-2 weeks.

     There are no effective antiviral treatments for the common cold and antibacterial drugs should not be prescribed
     unless secondary bacterial infections have been established. Many of the viruses that cause colds are related, so
     immunity develops throughout life. Given the number of viruses that cause colds, however, individuals are never
     likely to develop immunity to all causes of the common cold.

       Since antibiotic treatment had proven ineffective, John's doctor suspects that a viral or fungal pathogen may be
       the culprit behind John's case of pneumonia. Another possibility is that John could have an antibiotic-resistant
       bacterial infection that will require a different antibiotic or combination of antibiotics to clear.
       The RIDT tests both came back negative for type A and type B influenza. However, the diagnostic laboratory
       identified the sputum isolate as Legionella pneumophila. The doctor ordered tests of John's urine and, on the
       second day after his admission, results of an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were positive for the Legionella
       antigen. John's doctor added levofloxacin to his antibiotic therapy and continued to monitor him. The doctor also
       began to ask John where he had been over the past 10 to 14 days.

     Influenza

     Commonly known as the flu, influenza is a common viral disease caused by an orthomyxovirus that primarily affects
     the upper respiratory tract but can also extend into the lower respiratory tract. Influenza is pervasive worldwide and
     causes 3,000-50,000 deaths each year in the United States. The annual mortality rate can vary greatly depending
     on the virulence of the strain(s) responsible for seasonal epidemics. 18

Influenza infections are most typically characterized by fever, chills, and body aches. This is followed by symptoms
similar to the common cold that may last a week or more. Table 22.2 compares the signs and symptoms of influenza
and the common cold.

TABLE 22.2

In general, influenza is self-limiting. However, serious cases can lead to pneumonia and other complications that
can be fatal. Such cases are more common in the very young and the elderly; however, certain strains of influenza
virus (like the 1918-1919 variant discussed later in this chapter) are more lethal to young adults than to the very
young or old. Strains that affect young adults are believed to involve a cytokine storm--a positive feedback loop that
forms between cytokine production and leukocytes. This cytokine storm produces an acute inflammatory response
that leads to rapid fluid accumulation in the lungs, culminating in pulmonary failure. In such cases, the ability to
mount a vigorous immune response is actually detrimental to the patient. The very young and very old are less
susceptible to this effect because their immune systems are less robust.

A complication of influenza that occurs primarily in children and teenagers is Reye syndrome. This sequela causes
swelling in the liver and brain, and may progress to neurological damage, coma, or death. Reye syndrome may follow
other viral infections, like chickenpox, and has been associated with the use of aspirin. For this reason, the CDC and
other agencies recommend that aspirin and products containing aspirin never be used to treat viral illnesses in
children younger than age 19 years.19

The influenza virus is primarily transmitted by direct contact and inhalation of aerosols. The RNA genome of this
virus exists as seven or eight segments, each coated with ribonucleoprotein and encoding one or two specific viral
proteins. The influenza virus is surrounded by a lipid membrane envelope, and two of the main antigens of the
influenza virus are the spike proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), as shown in Figure 22.17. These
spike proteins play important roles in the viral infectious cycle.

     neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, and surrounds the individual seven or eight RNA genome segments. (credit: modification of work by Dan
     Higgins, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Following inhalation, the influenza virus uses the hemagglutinin protein to bind to sialic acid receptors on host
     respiratory epithelial cells. This facilitates endocytosis of the viral particle. Once inside the host cell, the negative
     strand viral RNA is replicated by the viral RNA polymerase to form mRNA, which is translated by the host to produce
     viral proteins. Additional viral RNA molecules are transcribed to produce viral genomic RNA, which assemble with
     viral proteins to form mature virions. Release of the virions from the host cell is facilitated by viral neuraminidase,
     which cleaves sialic-acid receptors to allow progeny viruses to make a clean exit when budding from an infected
     cell.

     There are three genetically related influenza viruses, called A, B, and C. The influenza A viruses have different
     subtypes based on the structure of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. There are currently 18 known
     subtypes of hemagglutinin and 11 known subtypes of neuraminidase. Influenza viruses are serologically
     characterized by the type of H and N proteins that they possess. Of the nearly 200 different combinations of H and
     N, only a few, such as the H1N1 strain, are associated with human disease. The influenza viruses A, B, and C make
     up three of the five major groups of orthomyxoviruses. The differences between the three types of influenza are
     summarized in Table 22.3. The most virulent group is the influenza A viruses, which cause seasonal pandemics of
     influenza each year. Influenza A virus can infect a variety of animals, including pigs, horses, and even whales and
     dolphins. Influenza B virus is less virulent and is sometimes associated with epidemic outbreaks. Influenza C virus
     generally produces the mildest disease symptoms and is rarely connected with epidemics. Neither influenza B virus
     nor influenza C virus has significant animal reservoirs.

protect the individual if they encountered the same virus. Unfortunately, the antigenic properties of the virus change
relatively rapidly, so new strains are evolving that immune systems previously challenged by influenza virus cannot
recognize. When an influenza virus gains a new hemagglutinin or neuraminidase type, it is able to evade the host's
immune response and be successfully transmitted, often leading to an epidemic.

There are two mechanisms by which these evolutionary changes may occur. The mechanisms of antigen drift and
antigenic shift for influenza virus have been described in Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens. Of these
two genetic processes, it is viruses produced by antigenic shift that have the potential to be extremely virulent
because individuals previously infected by other strains are unlikely to produce any protective immune response
against these novel variants.

The most lethal influenza pandemic in recorded history occurred from 1918 through 1919. Near the end of World
War I, an antigenic shift involving the recombination of avian and human viruses is thought to have produced a new
H1N1 virus. This strain rapidly spread worldwide and is commonly claimed to have killed as many as 40 million to
50 million people--more than double the number killed in the war. Although referred to as the Spanish flu, this
disease is thought to have originated in the United States. Regardless of its source, the conditions of World War I
greatly contributed to the spread of this disease. Crowding, poor sanitation, and rapid mobilization of large numbers
of personnel and animals facilitated the dissemination of the new virus once it appeared.

Several of the most important influenza pandemics of modern times have been associated with antigenic shifts. A
few of these are summarized in Table 22.4.

Laboratory diagnosis of influenza is typically performed using a variety of RIDTs. These tests are inoculated by point-
of-care personnel and give results within 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, these tests have variable sensitivity and
commonly yield false-negative results. Other tests include hemagglutination of erythrocytes (due to hemagglutinin
action) or complement fixation. Patient serum antibodies against influenza viruses can also be detected in blood
samples. Because influenza is self-limiting disease, diagnosis through these more time-consuming and expensive
methods is not typically used.

     Three drugs that inhibit influenza neuraminidase activity are available: inhaled zanamivir, oral oseltamivir, and
     intravenous peramivir. If taken at the onset of symptoms, these drugs can shorten the course of the disease. These
     drugs are thought to impair the ability of the virus to efficiently exit infected host cells. A more effective means of
     controlling influenza outbreaks, though, is vaccination. Every year, new influenza vaccines are developed to be
     effective against the strains expected to be predominant. This is determined in February by a review of the dominant
     strains around the world from a network of reporting sites; their reports are used to generate a recommendation for
     the vaccine combination for the following winter in the northern hemisphere. In September, a similar
     recommendation is made for the winter in the southern hemisphere.23 These recommendations are used by
     vaccine manufacturers to formulate each year's vaccine. In most cases, three or four viruses are selected--the two
     most prevalent influenza A strains and one or two influenza B strains. The chosen strains are typically cultivated in
     eggs and used to produce either an inactivated or a live attenuated vaccine (e.g., FluMist). For individuals 18 years
     or older with an allergy to egg products, a recombinant egg-free trivalent vaccine is available. Most of the influenza
     vaccines over the past decade have had an effectiveness of about 50%.24

       CASE IN POINT

       Flu Pandemic

       During the spring of 2013, a new strain of H7N9 influenza was reported in China. A total of 132 people were
       infected. Of those infected, 44 (33%) died. A genetic analysis of the virus suggested that this strain arose from
       the reassortment of three different influenza viruses: a domestic duck H7N3 virus, a wild bird H7N9 virus, and a
       domestic poultry H9N2 virus. The virus was detected in the Chinese domestic bird flocks and contact with this
       reservoir is thought to have been the primary source of infection. This strain of influenza was not able to spread
       from person to person. Therefore, the disease did not become a global problem. This case does, though,
       illustrate the potential threat that influenza still represents. If a strain like the H7N9 virus were to undergo
       another antigenic shift, it could become more communicable in the human population. With a mortality rate of
       33%, such a pandemic would be disastrous. For this reason, organizations like the World Health Organization
       and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keep all known influenza outbreaks under constant
       surveillance.

     Viral Pneumonia

     Viruses cause fewer cases of pneumonia than bacteria; however, several viruses can lead to pneumonia in children
     and the elderly. The most common sources of viral pneumonia are adenoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza
     viruses, and respiratory syncytial viruses. The signs and symptoms produced by these viruses can range from mild
     cold-like symptoms to severe cases of pneumonia, depending on the virulence of the virus strain and the strength of
     the host defenses of the infected individual. Occasionally, infections can result in otitis media.

     Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are fairly common in infants; most people have been infected by the age
     of 2 years. During infection, a viral surface protein causes host cells to fuse and form multinucleated giant cells
     called syncytia. There are no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines available for viral pneumonia. In adults, these
     infections are self-limiting, resemble the common cold, and tend to resolve uneventfully within 1 or 2 weeks.
     Infections in infants, however, can be life-threatening. RSV is highly contagious and can be spread through
     respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. RSV can also survive for a long time on environmental surfaces
     and, thus, be transmitted indirectly via fomites.

SARS and MERS

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are two acute respiratory
infections caused by coronaviruses. In both cases, these are thought to be zoonotic infections. Bats and civet cats
are thought to have been the reservoirs for SARS; camels seem to be the reservoir for MERS.

SARS originated in southern China in the winter of 2002 and rapidly spread to 37 countries. Within about 1 year,
more than 8,000 people experienced influenza-like symptoms and nearly 800 people died. The rapid spread and
severity of these infections caused grave concern at the time. However, the outbreak was controlled in 2003 and no
further cases of SARS have been recorded since 2004.25 Signs and symptoms of SARS include high fever, headache,
body aches, and cough, and most patients will develop pneumonia.

MERS was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2013. Although some infected individuals will be asymptomatic or have
mild cold-like symptoms, most will develop a high fever, aches, cough and a severe respiratory infection that can
progress to pneumonia. As of 2015, over 1,300 people in 27 countries have been infected. About 500 people have
died. There are no specific treatments for either MERS or SARS. In addition, no vaccines are currently available.
Several recombinant vaccines, however, are being developed.

Viral Respiratory Diseases Causing Skin Rashes

Measles, rubella (German measles), and chickenpox are three important viral diseases often associated with skin
rashes. However, their symptoms are systemic, and because their portal of entry is the respiratory tract, they can be
considered respiratory infections.

Measles (Rubeola)
The measles virus (MeV) causes the highly contagious disease measles, also known as rubeola, which is a major
cause of childhood mortality worldwide. Although vaccination efforts have greatly reduced the incidence of measles
in much of the world, epidemics are still common in unvaccinated populations in certain countries.26

The measles virus is a single-stranded, negative-strand RNA virus and, like the influenza virus, it possesses an
envelope with spikes of embedded hemagglutinin. The infection is spread by direct contact with infectious
secretions or inhalation of airborne droplets spread by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Measles is initially
characterized by a high fever, conjunctivitis, and a sore throat. The virus then moves systemically through the
bloodstream and causes a characteristic rash. The measles rash initially forms on the face and later spreads to the
extremities. The red, raised macular rash will eventually become confluent and can last for several days. At the
same time, extremely high fevers (higher than 40.6 °C [105 °F]) can occur. Another diagnostic sign of measles
infections is Koplik's spots, white spots that form on the inner lining of inflamed cheek tissues (Figure 22.18).

     Although measles is usually self-limiting, it can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. In addition, the
     inhibition of immune system cells by the measles virus predisposes patients to secondary infections. In severe
     infections with highly virulent strains, measles fatality rates can be as high as 10% to 15%. There were more than
     145,000 measles deaths (mostly young children) worldwide in 2013.27

     The preliminary diagnosis of measles is typically based on the appearance of the rash and Koplik's spots.
     Hemagglutination inhibition tests and serological tests may be used to confirm measles infections in low-prevalence
     settings.

     There are no effective treatments for measles. Vaccination is widespread in developed countries as part of the
     measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. As a result, there are typically fewer than 200 cases of measles in the
     United States annually.28 When it is seen, it is often associated with children who have not been vaccinated.

     outbreak affected 134 people in 24 states.29 Characterization of the virus suggests that an unidentified infected
     individual brought the disease to the United States from the Philippines, where a similar virus had sickened more
     than 58,000 people and killed 110.30 Measles is highly communicable, and its spread at Disneyland may have been
     facilitated by the low vaccination rate in some communities in California.31

Several factors could conceivably lead to a strong comeback of measles in the U.S. Measles is still an epidemic
disease in many locations worldwide. Air travel enables infected individuals to rapidly translocate these infections
globally. Compounding this problem, low vaccination rates in some communities in the United States provide
populations of susceptible hosts for the virus to establish itself. Finally, measles has been a low-prevalence
infection in the U.S. for some time. As a consequence, physicians are not as likely to recognize the initial symptoms
and make accurate diagnoses. Until vaccination rates become high enough to ensure herd immunity, measles is
likely to be an ongoing problem in the United States.

Rubella (German Measles)
Rubella, or the German measles, is a relatively mild viral disease that produces a rash somewhat like that caused by
the measles, even though the two diseases are unrelated. The rubella virus is an enveloped RNA virus that can be
found in the respiratory tract. It is transmitted from person to person in aerosols produced by coughing or sneezing.
Nearly half of all infected people remain asymptomatic. However, the virus is shed and spread by asymptomatic
carriers. Like rubeola, rubella begins with a facial rash that spreads to the extremities (Figure 22.19). However, the
rash is less intense, shorter lived (2-3 days), not associated with Koplik's spots, and the resulting fever is lower (101
°F [38.3 °C]).

Congenital rubella syndrome is the most severe clinical complication of the German measles. This occurs if a person
is infected with rubella during pregnancy. The rubella virus is teratogenic, meaning it can cause developmental
defects if it crosses the placenta during pregnancy. There is a very high incidence of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion,
or congenital birth defects if a person is infected before 11 weeks of pregnancy and 35% if they are infected
between weeks 13-16; after this time the incidence is low.32 For this reason, prenatal screening for rubella is
commonly practiced in the United States. Postnatal infections are usually self-limiting and rarely cause severe
complications.

Like measles, the preliminary diagnosis of rubella is based on the patient's history, vaccination records, and the
appearance of the rash. The diagnosis can be confirmed by hemagglutinin inhibition assays and a variety of other
immunological techniques. There are no antiviral therapies for rubella, but an effective vaccine (MMR) is widely
available. Vaccination efforts have essentially eliminated rubella in the United States; fewer than a dozen cases are
reported in a typical year.

of measles and the lesions are not confluent. (b) This transmission electron micrograph shows rubella virus virions just budding from a host

Chickenpox and Shingles
Chickenpox, also known as varicella, was once a common viral childhood disease. The causative agent of
chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, is a member of the herpesvirus family. In children, the disease is mild and

32 E. Miller et al. "Consequences of Confirmed Maternal Rubella at Successive Stages of Pregnancy." The Lancet 320, no. 8302

     self-limiting, and is easily transmitted by direct contact or inhalation of material from the skin lesions. In adults,
     however, chickenpox infections can be much more severe and can lead to pneumonia and birth defects in the case
     of infected pregnant people. Reye syndrome, mentioned earlier in this chapter, is also a serious complication
     associated with chickenpox, generally in children.

     Once infected, most individuals acquire a lifetime immunity to future chickenpox outbreaks. For this reason, parents
     once held "chickenpox parties" for their children. At these events, uninfected children were intentionally exposed to
     an infected individual so they would contract the disease earlier in life, when the incidence of complications is very
     low, rather than risk a more severe infection later.

     After the initial viral exposure, chickenpox has an incubation period of about 2 weeks. The initial infection of the
     respiratory tract leads to viremia and eventually produces fever and chills. A pustular rash then develops on the
     face, progresses to the trunk, and then the extremities, although most form on the trunk (Figure 22.20). Eventually,
     the lesions burst and form a crusty scab. Individuals with chickenpox are infectious from about 2 days before the
     outbreak of the rash until all the lesions have scabbed over.

     FIGURE 22.20 (a) and (b) The characteristic appearance of the pustular chickenpox rash is concentrated on the trunk region. (c) This
     transmission electron micrograph shows a virion of human herpesvirus 3, the virus that causes chickenpox in children and shingles when it
     is reactivated in adults. Credit b: John Noble/CDC. c: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Like other herpesviruses, the varicella-zoster virus can become dormant in nerve cells. While the pustular vesicles
     are developing, the virus moves along sensory nerves to the dorsal ganglia in the spinal cord. Once there, the
     varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for decades. These dormant viruses may be reactivated later in life by a
     variety of stimuli, including stress, aging, and immunosuppression. Once reactivated, the virus moves along sensory
     nerves to the skin of the face or trunk. This results in the production of the painful lesions in a condition known as
     shingles (Figure 22.21). These symptoms generally last for 2-6 weeks, and may recur more than once. Postherpetic
     neuralgia, pain signals sent from damaged nerves long after the other symptoms have subsided, is also possible. In
     addition, the virus can spread to other organs in immunocompromised individuals. A person with shingles lesions
     can transmit the virus to a nonimmune contact, and the newly infected individual would develop chickenpox as the
     primary infection. Shingles cannot be transmitted from one person to another.
     The primary diagnosis of chickenpox in children is mainly based on the presentation of a pustular rash of the trunk.
     Serological and PCR-based tests are available to confirm the initial diagnosis. Treatment for chickenpox infections in
     children is usually not required. In patients with shingles, acyclovir treatment can often reduce the severity and
     length of symptoms, and diminish the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. An effective vaccine is now available for
     chickenpox. A vaccine is also available for adults older than 60 years who were infected with chickenpox in their
     youth. This vaccine reduces the likelihood of a shingles outbreak by boosting the immune defenses that are keeping
     the latent infection in check and preventing reactivation.

  EYE ON ETHICS

  Smallpox Stockpiles

  Smallpox has probably killed more humans than any other infectious disease, with the possible exception of
  tuberculosis. This disease, caused by the variola major virus, is transmitted by inhalation of viral particles shed
  from lesions in the throat. The smallpox virus spreads systemically in the bloodstream and produces a pustular
  skin rash. Historical epidemics of smallpox had fatality rates of 50% or greater in susceptible populations.
  Concerted worldwide vaccination efforts eradicated smallpox from the general population in 1977. This was the
  first microbial disease in history to be eradicated, a feat made possible by the fact that the only reservoir for the
  smallpox virus is infected humans.

  Although the virus is no longer present in the wild, laboratory samples of the virus still exist in the United States
  and Russia.33 The question is, why do these samples still exist? Some claim that these stocks should be
  maintained for research purposes. Should the smallpox virus ever reappear, they say, we would need access to
  such stocks for development of vaccines and treatments. Concerns about a re-emergence of the virus are not
  totally unfounded. Although there are no living reservoirs of the virus, there is always the possibility that
  smallpox could re-emerge from mummified human bodies or human remains preserved in permafrost. It is also
  possible that there are as-yet undiscovered samples of the virus in other locations around the world. An
  example of such "lost" samples was discovered in a drawer in a Food and Drug Administration lab in
  Maryland.34 If an outbreak from such a source were to occur, it could lead to uncontrolled epidemics, since the
  population is largely unvaccinated now.

  Critics of this argument, including many research scientists and the World Health Organization, claim that there
  is no longer any rational argument for keeping the samples. They view the "re-emergence scenarios" as a thinly
  veiled pretense for harboring biological weapons. These scenarios, they say, are less probable than an
  intentional reintroduction of the virus from militarized stocks by humans. Furthermore, they point out that if we
  needed to research smallpox in the future, we could rebuild the virus from its DNA sequence.

  What do you think? Are there legitimate arguments for maintaining stockpiles of smallpox, or should all forms of
  this deadly disease be eradicated?

     DISEASE PROFILE

     Viral Infections of the Respiratory Tract

     Many viruses are capable of entering and causing disease in the respiratory system, and a number are able to
     spread beyond the respiratory system to cause systemic infections. Most of these infections are highly
     contagious and, with a few exceptions, antimicrobial drugs are not effective for treatment. Although some of
     these infections are self-limiting, others can have serious or fatal complications. Effective vaccines have been
     developed for several of these diseases, as summarized in Figure 22.22.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common fungi that can cause infections of the respiratory tract
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific fungal diseases of the respiratory tract

Fungal pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment. Serological studies have demonstrated that most people have
been exposed to fungal respiratory pathogens during their lives. Yet symptomatic infections by these microbes are
rare in healthy individuals. This demonstrates the efficacy of the defenses of our respiratory system. In this section,
we will examine some of the fungi that can cause respiratory infections.

Histoplasmosis

Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease of the respiratory system and most commonly occurs in the Mississippi Valley of
the United States and in parts of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The causative agent,
Histoplasma capsulatum, is a dimorphic fungus. This microbe grows as a filamentous mold in the environment but
occurs as a budding yeast during human infections. The primary reservoir for this pathogen is soil, particularly in
locations rich in bat or bird feces.

Histoplasmosis is acquired by inhaling microconidial spores in the air; this disease is not transmitted from human to
human. The incidence of histoplasmosis exposure is high in endemic areas, with 60%-90% of the population
having anti-Histoplasma antibodies, depending on location;35 however, relatively few individuals exposed to the
fungus actually experience symptoms. Those most likely to be affected are the very young, the elderly, and
immunocompromised people.

In many ways, the course of this disease is similar to that of tuberculosis. Following inhalation, the spores enter the
lungs and are phagocytized by alveolar macrophages. The fungal cells then survive and multiply within these
phagocytes (see Figure 5.26). Focal infections cause the formation of granulomatous lesions, which can lead to
calcifications that resemble the Ghon complexes of tuberculosis, even in asymptomatic cases. Also like
tuberculosis, histoplasmosis can become chronic and reactivation can occur, along with dissemination to other
areas of the body (e.g., the liver or spleen).

Signs and symptoms of pulmonary histoplasmosis include fever, headache, and weakness with some chest
discomfort. The initial diagnosis is often based on chest radiographs and cultures grown on fungal selective media
like Sabouraud's dextrose agar. Direct fluorescence antibody staining and Giemsa staining can also be used to
detect this pathogen. In addition, serological tests including a complement fixation assay and histoplasmin
sensitivity can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In most cases, these infections are self-limiting and antifungal
therapy is not required. However, in disseminated disease, the antifungal agents amphotericin B and ketoconazole
are effective; itraconazole may be effective in immunocompromised patients, in whom the disease can be more
serious.

Coccidioidomycosis

Infection by the dimorphic fungus Coccidioides immitis causes coccidioidomycosis. Because the microbe is
endemic to the San Joaquin Valley of California, the disease is sometimes referred to as Valley fever. A related
species that causes similar infections is found in semi-arid and arid regions of the southwestern United States,
Mexico, and Central and South America.36

Like histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis is acquired by inhaling fungal spores--in this case, arthrospores formed by

     hyphal fragmentation. Once in the body, the fungus differentiates into spherules that are filled with endospores.
     Most C. immitis infections are asymptomatic and self-limiting. However, the infection can be very serious for
     immunocompromised patients. The endospores may be transported in the blood, disseminating the infection and
     leading to the formation of granulomatous lesions on the face and nose (Figure 22.23). In severe cases, other major
     organs can become infected, leading to serious complications such as fatal meningitis.

     Coccidioidomycosis can be diagnosed by culturing clinical samples. C. immitis readily grows on laboratory fungal
     media, such as Sabouraud's dextrose agar, at 35 °C (95 °F). Culturing the fungus, however, is rather dangerous. C.
     immitis is one of the most infectious fungal pathogens known and is capable of causing laboratory-acquired
     infections. Indeed, until 2012, this organism was considered a "select agent" of bioterrorism and classified as a
     BSL-3 microbe. Serological tests for antibody production are more often used for diagnosis. Although mild cases
     generally do not require intervention, disseminated infections can be treated with intravenous antifungal drugs like
     amphotericin B.

       CLINICAL FOCUS
       Resolution

       John's negative RIDT tests do not rule out influenza, since false-negative results are common, but the Legionella
       infection still must be treated with antibiotic therapy and is the more serious condition. John's prognosis is good,
       provided the physician can find an antibiotic therapy to which the infection responds.

       While John was undergoing treatment, three of the employees from the home improvement store also reported
       to the clinic with very similar symptoms. All three were older than 55 years and had Legionella antigen in their
       urine; L. pneumophila was also isolated from their sputum. A team from the health department was sent to the
       home improvement store to identify a probable source for these infections. Their investigation revealed that
       about 3 weeks earlier, the store's air conditioning system, which was located where the employees ate lunch,
       had been undergoing maintenance. L. pneumophila was isolated from the cooling coils of the air conditioning
       system and intracellular L. pneumophila was observed in amoebae in samples of condensed water from the
       cooling coils as well (Figure 22.24). The amoebae provide protection for the Legionella bacteria and are known
       to enhance their pathogenicity.37

       In the wake of the infections, the store ordered a comprehensive cleaning of the air conditioning system and
       implemented a regular maintenance program to prevent the growth of biofilms within the cooling tower. They
       also reviewed practices at their other facilities.

After a month of rest at home, John recovered from his infection enough to return to work, as did the other three
employees of the store. However, John experienced lethargy and joint pain for more than a year after his
treatment.

Blastomycosis

Blastomycosis is a rare disease caused by another dimorphic fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis. Like Histoplasma
and Coccidioides, Blastomyces uses the soil as a reservoir, and fungal spores can be inhaled from disturbed soil.
The pulmonary form of blastomycosis generally causes mild flu-like symptoms and is self-limiting. It can, however,
become disseminated in immunocompromised people, leading to chronic cutaneous disease with subcutaneous
lesions on the face and hands (Figure 22.25). These skin lesions eventually become crusty and discolored and can
result in deforming scars. Systemic blastomycosis is rare, but if left untreated, it is always fatal.

Preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary blastomycosis can be made by observing the characteristic budding yeast forms
in sputum samples. Commercially available urine antigen tests are now also available. Additional confirmatory tests
include serological assays such as immunodiffusion tests or EIA. Most cases of blastomycosis respond well to
amphotericin B or ketoconazole treatments.

     Mucormycosis

     A variety of fungi in the order Mucorales cause mucormycosis, a rare fungal disease. These include bread molds,
     like Rhizopus and Mucor; the most commonly associated species is Rhizopus arrhizus (oryzae) (see Figure 5.28).
     These fungi can colonize many different tissues in immunocompromised patients, but often infect the skin, sinuses,
     or the lungs.

     Although most people are regularly exposed to the causative agents of mucormycosis, infections in healthy
     individuals are rare. Exposure to spores from the environment typically occurs through inhalation, but the spores
     can also infect the skin through a wound or the gastrointestinal tract if ingested. Respiratory mucormycosis primarily
     affects immunocompromised individuals, such as patients with cancer or those who have had a transplant.38

     After the spores are inhaled, the fungi grow by extending hyphae into the host's tissues. Infections can occur in both
     the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an infection of the sinuses and brain;
     symptoms include headache, fever, facial swelling, congestion, and tissue necrosis causing black lesions in the oral
     cavity. Pulmonary mucormycosis is an infection of the lungs; symptoms include fever, cough, chest pain, and
     shortness of breath. In severe cases, infections may become disseminated and involve the central nervous system,
     leading to coma and death.39

     Diagnosing mucormycosis can be challenging. Currently, there are no serological or PCR-based tests available to
     identify these infections. Tissue biopsy specimens must be examined for the presence of the fungal pathogens. The
     causative agents, however, are often difficult to distinguish from other filamentous fungi. Infections are typically
     treated by the intravenous administration of amphotericin B, and superficial infections are removed by surgical
     debridement. Since the patients are often immunocompromised, viral and bacterial secondary infections commonly
     develop. Mortality rates vary depending on the site of the infection, the causative fungus, and other factors, but a
     recent study found an overall mortality rate of 54%.40

     Aspergillosis

     Aspergillus is a common filamentous fungus found in soils and organic debris. Nearly everyone has been exposed to
     this mold, yet very few people become sick. In immunocompromised patients, however, Aspergillus may become
     established and cause aspergillosis. Inhalation of spores can lead to asthma-like allergic reactions. The symptoms
     commonly include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, runny nose, and headaches. Fungal balls, or
     aspergilloma, can form when hyphal colonies collect in the lungs (Figure 22.26). The fungal hyphae can invade the
     host tissues, leading to pulmonary hemorrhage and a bloody cough. In severe cases, the disease may progress to a
     disseminated form that is often fatal. Death most often results from pneumonia or brain hemorrhages.

     Laboratory diagnosis typically requires chest radiographs and a microscopic examination of tissue and respiratory
     fluid samples. Serological tests are available to identify Aspergillus antigens. In addition, a skin test can be
     performed to determine if the patient has been exposed to the fungus. This test is similar to the Mantoux tuberculin
     skin test used for tuberculosis. Aspergillosis is treated with intravenous antifungal agents, including itraconazole

and voriconazole. Allergic symptoms can be managed with corticosteroids because these drugs suppress the
immune system and reduce inflammation. However, in disseminated infections, corticosteroids must be
discontinued to allow a protective immune response to occur.

Pneumocystis Pneumonia

A type of pneumonia called Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. Once thought to
be a protozoan, this organism was formerly named P. carinii but it has been reclassified as a fungus and renamed
based on biochemical and genetic analyses. Pneumocystis is a leading cause of pneumonia in patients with acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and can be seen in other compromised patients and premature infants.
Respiratory infection leads to fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Diagnosis of these infections can be difficult.
The organism is typically identified by microscopic examination of tissue and fluid samples from the lungs (Figure
22.27). A PCR-based test is available to detect P. jirovecii in asymptomatic patients with AIDS. The best treatment
for these infections is the combination drug trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ). These sulfa drugs often
have adverse effects, but the benefits outweigh these risks. Left untreated, PCP infections are often fatal.

Cryptococcosis

Infection by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans causes cryptococcosis. This fungus is ubiquitous in
the soil and can be isolated from bird feces. Immunocompromised people are infected by inhaling basidiospores
found in aerosols. The thick polysaccharide capsule surrounding these microbes enables them to avoid clearance by
the alveolar macrophage. Initial symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. In
immunocompromised patients, pulmonary infections often disseminate to the brain. The resulting meningitis
906  22 · Respiratory System Infections

     produces headaches, sensitivity to light, and confusion. Left untreated, such infections are often fatal.

     Cryptococcus infections are often diagnosed based on microscopic examination of lung tissues or cerebrospinal
     fluids. India ink preparations (Figure 22.28) can be used to visualize the extensive capsules that surround the yeast
     cells. Serological tests are also available to confirm the diagnosis. Amphotericin B, in combination with flucytosine,
     is typically used for the initial treatment of pulmonary infections. Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal
     drug that targets fungal cell membranes. It can also adversely impact host cells and produce side effects. For this
     reason, clinicians must carefully balance the risks and benefits of treatments in these patients. Because it is difficult
     to eradicate cryptococcal infections, patients usually need to take fluconazole for up to 6 months after treatment
     with amphotericin B and flucytosine to clear the fungus. Cryptococcal infections are more common in
     immunocompromised people, such as those with AIDS. These patients typically require life-long suppressive
     therapy to control this fungal infection.

       Fungal Diseases of the Respiratory Tract

       Most respiratory mycoses are caused by fungi that inhabit the environment. Such infections are generally
       transmitted via inhalation of fungal spores and cannot be transmitted between humans. In addition, healthy
       people are generally not susceptible to infection even when exposed; the fungi are only virulent enough to
       establish infection in patients with HIV, AIDS, or another condition that compromises the immune defenses.
       Figure 22.29 summarizes the features of important respiratory mycoses.

INTRODUCTION The urogenital system is a combination of the urinary tract and reproductive system. Because
both systems are open to the external environment, they are prone to infections. Some infections are introduced
from outside, whereas others result from imbalances in the microbiota of the urogenital tract.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting over 100 million
people each year. During 2007 in the United States, doctor office visits for UTIs exceeded 10 million, and an
additional 2-3 million emergency department visits were attributed to UTIs. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
also primarily affect the urogenital system and are an important cause of patient morbidity. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are approximately 20 million new cases of reportable STIs
annually in the United States, half of which occur in people aged 15-24 years old. When STIs spread to the
reproductive organs, they can be associated with severe morbidity and loss of fertility.
Because males and females have different urogenital anatomy, urogenital infections may affect males and females
differently. In this chapter, we will discuss the various microbes that cause urogenital disease and the factors that
contribute to their pathogenicity.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       Nadia is a newly married 26-year-old graduate student in economics. Recently she has been experiencing an
       unusual vaginal discharge, as well as some itching and discomfort. Since she is due for her annual physical
       exam, she makes an appointment with her doctor hoping that her symptoms can be quickly treated. However,
       she worries that she may have some sort of sexually transmitted infection (STI). Although she is now in a
       monogamous relationship, she is not fully certain of her spouse's sexual history and she is reluctant to ask him
       about it.

       At her checkup, Nadia describes her symptoms to her primary care physician and, somewhat awkwardly,
       explains why she thinks she might have an STI. Nadia's doctor reassures her that she regularly sees patients
       with similar concerns and encourages her to be fully transparent about her symptoms because some STIs can
       have serious complications if left untreated. After some further questioning, the doctor takes samples of Nadia's
       blood, urine, and vaginal discharge to be sent to the lab for testing.

     The urinary system filters blood, excretes wastes, and maintains an appropriate electrolyte and water balance. The
     reproductive system is responsible for the production of gametes and participates in conception and, in females,
     development of offspring. Due to their proximity and overlap, these systems are often studied together and referred
     to as the urogenital system (or genitourinary system).

     Anatomy of the Urinary Tract

     The basic structures of the urinary tract are common in males and females. However, there are unique locations for
     these structures in females and males, and there is a significant amount of overlap between the urinary and genital
     structures in males. Figure 23.2 illustrates the urinary anatomy common to females and males.

     The kidneys carry out the urinary system's primary functions of filtering the blood and maintaining water and
     electrolyte balance. The kidneys are composed of millions of filtration units called nephrons. Each nephron is in
     intimate contact with blood through a specialized capillary bed called the glomerulus (plural glomeruli). Fluids,
     electrolytes, and molecules from the blood pass from the glomerulus into the nephron, creating the filtrate that
     becomes urine (Figure 23.3). Urine that collects in each kidney empties through a ureter and drains to the urinary
     bladder, which stores urine. Urine is released from the bladder to the urethra, which transports it to be excreted
     from the body through the urinary meatus, the opening of the urethra.

FIGURE 23.2 These structures of the human urinary system are present in both males and females.

FIGURE 23.3 The kidney contains several lobes, each of which contains millions of nephrons. The nephron is the functional unit of the
kidney, filtering the blood and removing water and dissolved compounds. The filtrate first enters the glomerulus and then enters the
proximal convoluted tubule. As it passes through the tubule, the filtrate is further modified by osmosis and active transport until it reaches
the larger ducts as urine.

Anatomy of the Reproductive System

The male reproductive system (Figure 23.4) is located in close proximity to the urinary system, and the urethra is
part of both systems. The testes are responsible for the production of sperm. The epididymis is a coiled tube that
collects sperm from the testes and passes it on to the vas deferens. The epididymis is also the site of sperm
maturation after they leave the testes. The seminal vesicles and prostate are accessory glands that produce fluid
that supports sperm. During ejaculation, the vas deferens releases this mixture of fluid and sperm, called semen,
into the urethra, which extends to the end of the penis.

The female reproductive system is located near the urinary system (Figure 23.4). The external genitalia (vulva) in
females open to the vagina, a muscular passageway that connects to the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the
uterus (the organ where a fertilized egg will implant and develop). The cervix is a common site of infection,
especially for viruses that may lead to cervical cancer. The uterus leads to the fallopian tubes and eventually to the
ovaries. Ovaries are the site of ova (egg) production, as well as the site of estrogen and progesterone production that
are involved in maturation and maintenance of reproductive organs, preparation of the uterus for pregnancy, and
regulation of the menstrual cycle.

     Normal Microbiota of the Urogenital System

     The normal microbiota of different body sites provides an important nonspecific defense against infectious diseases
     (see Physical Defenses), and the urogenital tract is no exception. However, the kidneys are sterile. Although urine
     does contain some antibacterial components, bacteria will grow in urine left out at room temperature. Therefore, it
     is primarily the flushing action that keeps the ureters and bladder free of microbes.

     Below the bladder, the normal microbiota of the male urogenital system is found primarily within the distal urethra
     and includes bacterial species that are commonly associated with the skin microbiota. In females, the normal
     microbiota is found within the distal one third of the urethra and the vagina. The normal microbiota of the vagina
     becomes established shortly after birth and is a complex and dynamic population of bacteria that fluctuates in
     response to environmental changes. Members of the vaginal microbiota play an important role in the nonspecific
     defense against vaginal infections and sexually transmitted infections by occupying cellular binding sites and
     competing for nutrients. In addition, the production of lactic acid by members of the microbiota provides an acidic
     environment within the vagina that also serves as a defense against infections. For the majority of females, the
     lactic-acid-producing bacteria in the vagina are dominated by a variety of species of Lactobacillus. For females who
     lack sufficient lactobacilli in their vagina, lactic acid production comes primarily from other species of bacteria such
     as Leptotrichia spp., Megasphaera spp., and Atopobium vaginae. Lactobacillus spp. use glycogen from vaginal
     epithelial cells for metabolism and production of lactic acid. This process is tightly regulated by the hormone
     estrogen. Increased levels of estrogen correlate with increased levels of vaginal glycogen, increased production of
     lactic acid, and a lower vaginal pH. Therefore, decreases in estrogen during the menstrual cycle and with
     menopause are associated with decreased levels of vaginal glycogen and lactic acid, and a higher pH. In addition to
     producing lactic acid, Lactobacillus spp. also contribute to the defenses against infectious disease through their
     production of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins (antibacterial peptides).

     General Signs and Symptoms of Urogenital Infections

     Infections of the urinary tract most commonly cause inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) or of the urethra
     (urethritis). Urethritis can be associated with cystitis, but can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections.

Symptoms of urethritis in males include burning sensation while urinating, discharge from the penis, and blood in
the semen or the urine. In females, urethritis is associated with painful and frequent urination, vaginal discharge,
fever, chills, and abdominal pain. The symptoms of cystitis are similar to those of urethritis. When urethritis is
caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen, additional symptoms involving the genitalia can occur. These can
include painful vesicles (blisters), warts, and ulcers. Ureteritis, a rare infection of the ureter, can also occur with
cystitis. These infections can be acute or chronic.

Pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis are infections of the kidney that are potentially serious. Pyelonephritis is an
infection of one or both of the kidneys and may develop from a lower urinary tract infection; the upper urinary tract,
including the ureters, is often affected. Signs and symptoms of pyelonephritis include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
lower back pain, and frequent painful urination. Pyelonephritis usually only becomes chronic in individuals who have
malformations in or damage to the kidneys.

Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli of the nephrons. Symptoms include excessive protein and
blood in urine, increased blood pressure, and fluid retention leading to edema of face, hands, and feet.
Glomerulonephritis may be an acute infection or it can become chronic.

Infections occurring within the reproductive structures of males include epididymitis, orchitis, and prostatitis.
Bacterial infections may cause inflammation of the epididymis, called epididymitis. This inflammation causes pain
in the scrotum, testicles, and groin; swelling, redness, and warm skin in these areas may also be observed.
Inflammation of the testicle, called orchitis, is usually caused by a bacterial infection spreading from the
epididymis, but it can also be a complication of mumps, a viral disease. The symptoms are similar to those of
epididymitis, and it is not uncommon for them both to occur together, in which case the condition is called
epididymo-orchitis. Inflammation of the prostate gland, called prostatitis, can result from a bacterial infection. The
signs and symptoms of prostatitis include fever, chills, and pain in the bladder, testicles, and penis. Patients may
also experience burning during urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, and painful ejaculation.

Because of its proximity to the exterior, the vagina is a common site for infections. The general term for any
inflammation of the vagina is vaginitis. Vaginitis often develops as a result of an overgrowth of bacteria or fungi that
normally reside in the vaginal microbiota, although it can also result from infections by transient pathogens.
Bacterial infections of the vagina are called bacterial vaginosis, whereas fungal infections (typically involving
Candida spp.) are called yeast infections. Dynamic changes affecting the normal microbiota, acid production, and
pH variations can be involved in the initiation of the microbial overgrowth and the development of vaginitis. Although
some individuals may have no symptoms, vaginosis and vaginitis can be associated with discharge, odor, itching,
and burning.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive organs including the uterus, cervix,
fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The two most common pathogens are the sexually transmitted bacterial pathogens
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Inflammation of the fallopian tubes, called salpingitis, is the
most serious form of PID. Symptoms of PID can vary between people and include pain in the lower abdomen,
vaginal discharge, fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and painful urination.

General Causes and Modes of Transmission of Urogenital Infections

Hormonal changes, particularly shifts in estrogen due to pregnancy or menopause, can increase susceptibility to
urogenital infections. As discussed earlier, estrogen plays an important role in regulating the availability of glycogen
and subsequent production of lactic acid by Lactobacillus species. Low levels of estrogen are associated with an
increased vaginal pH and an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections. Estrogen also plays a role in
maintaining the elasticity, strength, and thickness of the vaginal wall, and keeps the vaginal wall lubricated, reducing
dryness. Low levels of estrogen are associated with thinning of the vaginal wall. This thinning increases the risk of
tears and abrasions, which compromise the protective barrier and increase susceptibility to pathogens.
918  23 · Urogenital System Infections

     Another common cause of urogenital infections in females is fecal contamination that occurs because of the close
     proximity of the anus and the urethra. Escherichia coli, an important member of the digestive tract microbiota, is the
     most common cause of urinary tract infections (urethritis and cystitis) in females; it generally causes infection when
     it is introduced to the urethra in fecal matter. Good hygiene can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections by this
     route. In males, urinary tract infections are more commonly associated with other conditions, such as an enlarged
     prostate, kidney stones, or placement of a urinary catheter. All of these conditions impair the normal emptying of the
     bladder, which serves to flush out microbes capable of causing infection.

     Infections that are transmitted between individuals through sexual contact are called sexually transmitted
     infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). (The CDC prefers the term STD, but WHO prefers STI,1
     which encompasses infections that result in disease as well as those that are subclinical or asymptomatic.) STIs
     often affect the external genitalia and skin, where microbes are easily transferred through physical contact. Lymph
     nodes in the genital region may also become swollen as a result of infection. However, many STIs have systemic
     effects as well, causing symptoms that range from mild (e.g., general malaise) to severe (e.g., liver damage or
     serious immunosuppression).

     23.2 Bacterial Infections of the Urinary System

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the most common bacterial pathogens that can cause urinary tract infections
         · Compare the major characteristics of specific bacterial diseases affecting the urinary tract

     Urinary tract infections (UTIs) include infections of the urethra, bladder, and kidneys, and are common causes of
     urethritis, cystitis, pyelonephritis, and glomerulonephritis. Bacteria are the most common causes of UTIs, especially
     in the urethra and bladder.

     Cystitis

     Cystitis is most often caused by a bacterial infection of the bladder, but it can also occur as a reaction to certain
     treatments or irritants such as radiation treatment, hygiene sprays, or spermicides. Common symptoms of cystitis
     include dysuria (urination accompanied by burning, discomfort, or pain), pyuria (pus in the urine), hematuria (blood
     in the urine), and bladder pain.

     In females, bladder infections are more common because the urethra is short and located in close proximity to the
     anus, which can result in infections of the urinary tract by fecal bacteria. Bladder infections are also more common
     in the elderly because the bladder may not empty fully, causing urine to pool; the elderly may also have weaker
     immune systems that make them more vulnerable to infection. Conditions such as prostatitis in males or kidney
     stones in males and females can impact proper drainage of urine and increase risk of bladder infections.
     Catheterization can also increase the risk of bladder infection (see Case in Point: Cystitis in the Elderly).

     Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (most commonly), Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
     Klebsiella pneumoniae cause most bladder infections. Gram-positive pathogens associated with cystitis include the
     coagulase-negative Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Routine
     manual urinalysis using a urine dipstick or test strip can be used for rapid screening of infection. These test strips
     (Figure 23.5) are either held in a urine stream or dipped in a sample of urine to test for the presence of nitrites,
     leukocyte esterase, protein, or blood that can indicate an active bacterial infection. The presence of nitrite may
     indicate the presence of E. coli or K. pneumonia; these bacteria produce nitrate reductase, which converts nitrate to
     nitrite. The leukocyte esterase (LE) test detects the presence of neutrophils as an indication of active infection.

Low specificity, sensitivity, or both, associated with these rapid screening tests require that care be taken in
interpretation of results and in their use in diagnosis of urinary tract infections. Therefore, positive LE or nitrite
results are followed by a urine culture to confirm a bladder infection. Urine culture is generally accomplished using
blood agar and MacConkey agar, and it is important to culture a clean catch of urine to minimize contamination with
normal microbiota of the penis and vagina. A clean catch of urine is accomplished by first washing the labia and
urethral opening of female patients or the penis of male patients. The patient then releases a small amount of urine
into the toilet bowl before stopping the flow of urine. Finally, the patient resumes urination, this time filling the
container used to collect the specimen.

Bacterial cystitis is commonly treated with fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins, or a combination of
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Pain medications may provide relief for patients with dysuria. Treatment is
more difficult in elderly patients, who experience a higher rate of complications such as sepsis and kidney
infections.

  CASE IN POINT

  Cystitis in the Elderly

  Robert, an 81-year-old widower with early onset Alzheimer's, was recently moved to a nursing home because he
  was having difficulty living on his own. Within a few weeks of his arrival, he developed a fever and began to
  experience pain associated with urination. He also began having episodes of confusion and delirium. The doctor
  assigned to examine Robert read his file and noticed that Robert was treated for prostatitis several years earlier.
  When he asked Robert how often he had been urinating, Robert explained that he had been trying not to drink
  too much so that he didn't have to walk to the restroom.

  All of this evidence suggests that Robert likely has a urinary tract infection. Robert's age means that his immune
  system has probably begun to weaken, and his previous prostate condition may be making it difficult for him to
  empty his bladder. In addition, Robert's avoidance of fluids has led to dehydration and infrequent urination,
  which may have allowed an infection to establish itself in his urinary tract. The fever and dysuria are common
  signs of a UTI in patients of all ages, and UTIs in elderly patients are often accompanied by a notable decline in
  mental function.
920  23 · Urogenital System Infections

       Physical challenges often discourage elderly individuals from urinating as frequently as they would otherwise. In
       addition, neurological conditions that disproportionately affect the elderly (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
       disease) may also reduce their ability to empty their bladders. Robert's doctor noted that he was having
       difficulty navigating his new home and recommended that he be given more assistance and that his fluid intake
       be monitored. The doctor also took a urine sample and ordered a laboratory culture to confirm the identity of the
       causative agent.

           · Should the doctor prescribe a broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum antibiotic to treat Robert's UTI? Why?

     Kidney Infections (Pyelonephritis and Glomerulonephritis)

     Pyelonephritis, an inflammation of the kidney, can be caused by bacteria that have spread from other parts of the
     urinary tract (such as the bladder). In addition, pyelonephritis can develop from bacteria that travel through the
     bloodstream to the kidney. When the infection spreads from the lower urinary tract, the causative agents are
     typically fecal bacteria such as E. coli. Common signs and symptoms include back pain (due to the location of the
     kidneys), fever, and nausea or vomiting. Gross hematuria (visible blood in the urine) occurs in 30-40% of females
     but is rare in males.2 The infection can become serious, potentially leading to bacteremia and systemic effects that
     can become life-threatening. Scarring of the kidney can occur and persist after the infection has cleared, which may
     lead to dysfunction.

     Diagnosis of pyelonephritis is made using microscopic examination of urine, culture of urine, testing for leukocyte
     esterase and nitrite levels, and examination of the urine for blood or protein. It is also important to use blood
     cultures to evaluate the spread of the pathogen into the bloodstream. Imaging of the kidneys may be performed in
     high-risk patients with diabetes or immunosuppression, the elderly, patients with previous renal damage, or to rule
     out an obstruction in the kidney. Pyelonephritis can be treated with either oral or intravenous antibiotics, including
     penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides.

     Glomerulonephritis occurs when the glomeruli of the nephrons are damaged from inflammation. Whereas
     pyelonephritis is usually acute, glomerulonephritis may be acute or chronic. The most well-characterized
     mechanism of glomerulonephritis is the post-streptococcal sequelae associated with Streptococcus pyogenes
     throat and skin infections. Although S. pyogenes does not directly infect the glomeruli of the kidney, immune
     complexes that form in blood between S. pyogenes antigens and antibodies lodge in the capillary endothelial cell
     junctions of the glomeruli and trigger a damaging inflammatory response. Glomerulonephritis can also occur in
     patients with bacterial endocarditis (infection and inflammation of heart tissue); however, it is currently unknown
     whether glomerulonephritis associated with endocarditis is also immune-mediated.

     Leptospirosis
     Leptospira are generally harmless spirochetes that are commonly found in the soil. However, some pathogenic
     species can cause an infection called leptospirosis in the kidneys and other organs (Figure 23.6). Leptospirosis can
     produce fever, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash with severe muscular pain. If the disease continues to
     progress, infection of the kidney, meninges, or liver may occur and may lead to organ failure or meningitis. When the
     kidney and liver become seriously infected, it is called Weil's disease. Pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome can also
     develop in the lungs, and jaundice may occur.

     Leptospira spp. are found widely in animals such as dogs, horses, cattle, pigs, and rodents, and are excreted in their
     urine. Humans generally become infected by coming in contact with contaminated soil or water, often while
     swimming or during flooding; infection can also occur through contact with body fluids containing the bacteria. The
     bacteria may enter the body through mucous membranes, skin injuries, or by ingestion. The mechanism of
     pathogenicity is not well understood.

Leptospirosis is extremely rare in the United States, although it is endemic in Hawaii; 50% of all cases in the United
States come from Hawaii.3 It is more common in tropical than in temperate climates, and individuals who work with
animals or animal products are most at risk. The bacteria can also be cultivated in specialized media, with growth
observed in broth in a few days to four weeks; however, diagnosis of leptospirosis is generally made using faster
methods, such as detection of antibodies to Leptospira spp. in patient samples using serologic testing. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), slide agglutination, and indirect
immunofluorescence tests may all be used for diagnosis. Treatment for leptospirosis involves broad-spectrum
antibiotics such as penicillin and doxycycline. For more serious cases of leptospirosis, antibiotics may be given
intravenously.

Nongonococcal Urethritis (NGU)

There are two main categories of bacterial urethritis: gonorrheal and nongonococcal. Gonorrheal urethritis is caused
by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is associated with gonorrhea, a common STI. This cause of urethritis will be discussed
in Bacterial Infections of the Reproductive System. The term nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) refers to
inflammation of the urethra that is unrelated to N. gonorrhoeae. In females, NGU is often asymptomatic. In males,
NGU is typically a mild disease, but can lead to purulent discharge and dysuria. Because the symptoms are often
mild or nonexistent, most infected individuals do not know that they are infected, yet they are carriers of the
disease. Asymptomatic patients also have no reason to seek treatment, and although not common, untreated NGU
can spread to the reproductive organs, causing pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis in females and
epididymitis and prostatitis in males. Important bacterial pathogens that cause nongonococcal urethritis include
Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis.

C. trachomatis is a difficult-to-stain, gram-negative bacterium with an ovoid shape. An intracellular pathogen, C.
trachomatis causes the most frequently reported STI in the United States, chlamydia. Although most persons
infected with C. trachomatis are asymptomatic, some patients can present with NGU. C. trachomatis can also cause
non-urogenital infections such as the ocular disease trachoma (see Bacterial Infections of the Skin and Eyes). The
life cycle of C. trachomatis is illustrated in Figure 4.12.

C. trachomatis has multiple possible virulence factors that are currently being studied to evaluate their roles in

3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Leptospirosis." 2015. http://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/health_care_workers.
922  23 · Urogenital System Infections

     causing disease. These include polymorphic outer-membrane autotransporter proteins, stress response proteins,
     and type III secretion effectors. The type III secretion effectors have been identified in gram-negative pathogens,
     including C. trachomatis. This virulence factor is an assembly of more than 20 proteins that form what is called an
     injectisome for the transfer of other effector proteins that target the infected host cells. The outer-membrane
     autotransporter proteins are also an effective mechanism of delivering virulence factors involved in colonization,
     disease progression, and immune system evasion.

     Other species associated with NGU include Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma
     hominis. These bacteria are commonly found in the normal microbiota of healthy individuals, who may acquire them
     during birth or through sexual contact, but they can sometimes cause infections leading to urethritis (in males and
     females) or vaginitis and cervicitis (in females).

     M. genitalium is a more common cause of urethritis in most settings than N. gonorrhoeae, although it is less
     common than C. trachomatis. It is responsible for approximately 30% of recurrent or persistent infections, 20-25%
     of nonchlamydial NGU cases, and 15%-20% of NGU cases. M. genitalium attaches to epithelial cells and has
     substantial antigenic variation that helps it evade host immune responses. It has lipid-associated membrane
     proteins that are involved in causing inflammation.

     Several possible virulence factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of U. urealyticum (Figure 23.7). These
     include the ureaplasma proteins phospholipase A, phospholipase C, multiple banded antigen (MBA), urease, and
     immunoglobulin  protease. The phospholipases are virulence factors that damage the cytoplasmic membrane of
     target cells. The immunoglobulin  protease is an important defense against antibodies. It can generate hydrogen
     peroxide, which may adversely affect host cell membranes through the production of reactive oxygen species.

     Treatments differ for gonorrheal and nongonococcal urethritis. However, N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are
     often simultaneously present, which is an important consideration for treatment. NGU is most commonly treated
     using tetracyclines (such as doxycycline) and azithromycin; erythromycin is an alternative option. Tetracyclines and
     fluoroquinolones are most commonly used to treat U. urealyticum, but resistance to tetracyclines is becoming an
     increasing problem.4 While tetracyclines have been the treatment of choice for M. hominis, increasing resistance
     means that other options must be used. Clindamycin and fluoroquinolones are alternatives. M. genitalium is
     generally susceptible to doxycycline, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin. Like other mycoplasma, M. genitalium does
     not have a cell wall and therefore -lactams (including penicillins and cephalosporins) are not effective treatments.

DISEASE PROFILE

Bacterial Infections of the Urinary Tract

Urinary tract infections can cause inflammation of the urethra (urethritis), bladder (cystitis), and kidneys
(pyelonephritis), and can sometimes spread to other body systems through the bloodstream. Figure 23.8
captures the most important features of various types of UTIs.

     23.3 Bacterial Infections of the Reproductive System

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the most common bacterial pathogens that can cause infections of the reproductive system
         · Compare the major characteristics of specific bacterial diseases affecting the reproductive system

     In addition to infections of the urinary tract, bacteria commonly infect the reproductive tract. As with the urinary
     tract, parts of the reproductive system closest to the external environment are the most likely sites of infection.
     Often, the same microbes are capable of causing urinary tract and reproductive tract infections.

     Bacterial Vaginitis and Vaginosis

     Inflammation of the vagina is called vaginitis, often caused by a bacterial infection. It is also possible to have an
     imbalance in the normal vaginal microbiota without inflammation called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Vaginosis may be
     asymptomatic or may cause mild symptoms such as a thin, white-to-yellow, homogeneous vaginal discharge,
     burning, odor, and itching. The major causative agent is Gardnerella vaginalis, a gram-variable to gram-negative
     pleomorphic bacterium. Other causative agents include anaerobic species such as members of the genera
     Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Additionally, ureaplasma and mycoplasma may be involved. The disease is usually
     self-limiting, although antibiotic treatment is recommended if symptoms develop.

     G. vaginalis appears to be more virulent than other vaginal bacterial species potentially associated with BV. Like
     Lactobacillus spp., G. vaginalis is part of the normal vaginal microbiota, but when the population of Lactobacillus
     spp. decreases and the vaginal pH increases, G. vaginalis flourishes, causing vaginosis by attaching to vaginal
     epithelial cells and forming a thick protective biofilm. G. vaginalis also produces a cytotoxin called vaginolysin that
     lyses vaginal epithelial cells and red blood cells.

     Since G. vaginalis can also be isolated from healthy females, the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of BV is direct
     examination of vaginal secretions and not the culture of G. vaginalis. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis from vaginal
     secretions can be accurately made in three ways. The first is to use a DNA probe. The second method is to assay for
     sialidase activity (sialidase is an enzyme produced by G. vaginalis and other bacteria associated with vaginosis,
     including Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., and Mobiluncus spp.). The third method is to assess gram-stained
     vaginal smears for microscopic morphology and relative numbers and types of bacteria, squamous epithelial cells,
     and leukocytes. By examining slides prepared from vaginal swabs, it is possible to distinguish lactobacilli (long,
     gram-positive rods) from other gram-negative species responsible for BV. A shift in predominance from gram-
     positive bacilli to gram-negative coccobacilli can indicate BV. Additionally, the slide may contain so-called clue cells,
     which are epithelial cells that appear to have a granular or stippled appearance due to bacterial cells attached to
     their surface (Figure 23.9). Presumptive diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis can involve an assessment of clinical
     symptoms and evaluation of vaginal fluids using Amsel's diagnostic criteria which include 3 out of 4 of the following
     characteristics:

       1. white to yellow discharge;
       2. a fishy odor, most noticeable when 10% KOH is added;
       3. pH greater than 4.5;
       4. the presence of clue cells.

     Treatment is often unnecessary because the infection often clears on its own. However, in some cases, antibiotics
     such as topical or oral clindamycin or metronidazole may be prescribed. Alternative treatments include oral
     tinidazole or clindamycin ovules (vaginal suppositories).

  There is no catch-all test for STIs, so several tests, in addition to a physical exam, are necessary to diagnose an
  infection. Nadia tries to relax in the exam room while she waits for the doctor to return, but she is nervous about
  the results.
  When the doctor finally returns, she has some unexpected news: Nadia is pregnant. Surprised and excited,
  Nadia wants to know if the pregnancy explains her unusual symptoms. The doctor explains that the irritation
  that Nadia is experiencing is vaginosis, which develops when there is an imbalance in the bacteria in the vagina,
  as often occurs during pregnancy. Vaginosis can increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight, and a
  few studies have also shown that it can cause second-trimester miscarriage; however, the condition can be
  treated. To check for it, the doctor has asked the lab to perform a Gram stain on Nadia's sample.

Gonorrhea

Also known as the clap, gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted disease of the reproductive system that is
especially prevalent in individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. It is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, often
926  23 · Urogenital System Infections

     called gonococcus or GC, which have fimbriae that allow the cells to attach to epithelial cells. It also has a type of
     lipopolysaccharide endotoxin called lipooligosaccharide as part of the outer membrane structure that enhances its
     pathogenicity. In addition to causing urethritis, N. gonorrhoeae can infect other body tissues such as the skin,
     meninges, pharynx, and conjunctiva.

     Many infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers of gonorrhea. When symptoms do occur, they manifest
     differently in males and females. Males may develop pain and burning during urination and discharge from the penis
     that may be yellow, green, or white (Figure 23.10). Less commonly, the testicles may become swollen or tender.
     Over time, these symptoms can increase and spread. In some cases, chronic infection develops. The disease can
     also develop in the rectum, causing symptoms such as discharge, soreness, bleeding, itching, and pain (especially in
     association with bowel movements).

     FIGURE 23.10 (a) Clinical photograph of gonococcal discharge from penis. The lesions on the skin could indicate co-infection with another

     These results could be used to diagnose gonorrhea in a male patient, but female vaginal samples may contain other Neisseria spp. even if
     the patient is not infected with N. gonorrhoeae. (credit a, b: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit c:
     modification of work by American Society for Microbiology)

     Females may develop pelvic pain, discharge from the vagina, intermenstrual bleeding (i.e., bleeding not associated
     with normal menstruation), and pain or irritation associated with urination. As with males, the infection can become
     chronic. In females, however, chronic infection can cause increases in menstrual flow. Rectal infection can also
     occur, with the symptoms previously described for males. Infections that spread to the endometrium and fallopian
     tubes can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), characterized by pain in the lower abdominal region, dysuria,
     vaginal discharge, and fever. PID can also lead to infertility through scarring and blockage of the fallopian tubes
     (salpingitis); it may also increase the risk of a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, which occurs when a fertilized egg
     begins developing somewhere other than the uterus (e.g., in the fallopian tube or ovary).

     When a gonorrhea infection disseminates throughout the body, serious complications can develop. The infection
     may spread through the blood (bacteremia) and affect organs throughout the body, including the heart (gonorrheal
     endocarditis), joints (gonorrheal arthritis), and meninges encasing the brain (meningitis).

     Urethritis caused by N. gonorrhoeae can be difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance (see Micro Connections).
     Some strains have developed resistance to the fluoroquinolones, so cephalosporins are often a first choice for
     treatment. Because co-infection with C. trachomatis is common, the CDC recommends treating with a combination
     regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Treatment of sexual partners is also recommended to avoid reinfection
     and spread of infection to others.5

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

Antibiotic Resistance in Neisseria

Antibiotic resistance in many pathogens is steadily increasing, causing serious concern throughout the public health
community. Increased resistance has been especially notable in some species, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The
CDC monitors the spread of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, which it classifies as an urgent threat, and
makes recommendations for treatment. So far, N. gonorrhoeae has shown resistance to cefixime (a cephalosporin),
ceftriaxone (another cephalosporin), azithromycin, and tetracycline. Resistance to tetracycline is the most common,
and was seen in 188,600 cases of gonorrhea in 2011 (out of a total 820,000 cases). In 2011, some 246,000 cases
of gonorrhea involved strains of N. gonorrhoeae that were resistant to at least one antibiotic.6 These resistance
genes are spread by plasmids, and a single bacterium may be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The CDC currently
recommends treatment with two medications, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, to attempt to slow the spread of
resistance. If resistance to cephalosporins increases, it will be extremely difficult to control the spread of N.
gonorrhoeae.

Chlamydia

Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the STI chlamydia (Figure 23.11). While many Chlamydia infections
are asymptomatic, chlamydia is a major cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and may also cause epididymitis
and orchitis in males. In females, chlamydia infections can cause urethritis, salpingitis, and PID. In addition,
chlamydial infections may be associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer.

Because chlamydia is widespread, often asymptomatic, and has the potential to cause substantial complications,
routine screening is recommended for sexually active females who are under age 25, at high risk, or beginning
prenatal care.

Certain serovars of C. trachomatis can cause an infection of the lymphatic system in the groin known as
lymphogranuloma venereum. This condition is commonly found in tropical regions and can also co-occur in
conjunction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. After the microbes invade the lymphatic system,
buboes (large lymph nodes, see Figure 23.11) form and can burst, releasing pus through the skin. The male genitals
can become greatly enlarged and in females the rectum may become narrow.

Urogenital infections caused by C. trachomatis can be treated using azithromycin or doxycycline (the recommended
regimen from the CDC). Erythromycin, levofloxacin, and ofloxacin are alternatives.

     Syphilis

     Syphilis is spread through direct physical (generally sexual) contact, and is caused by the gram-negative spirochete
     Treponema pallidum. T. pallidum has a relatively simple genome and lacks lipopolysaccharide endotoxin
     characteristic of gram-negative bacteria. However, it does contain lipoproteins that trigger an immune response in
     the host, causing tissue damage that may enhance the pathogen's ability to disseminate while evading the host
     immune system.

     After entering the body, T. pallidum moves rapidly into the bloodstream and other tissues. If not treated effectively,
     syphilis progresses through three distinct stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary syphilis appears as a
     single lesion on the cervix, penis, or anus within 10 to 90 days of transmission. Such lesions contain many T.
     pallidum cells and are highly infectious. The lesion, called a hard chancre, is initially hard and painless, but it soon
     develops into an ulcerated sore (Figure 23.12). Localized lymph node swelling may occur as well. In some cases,
     these symptoms may be relatively mild, and the lesion may heal on its own within two to six weeks. Because the
     lesions are painless and often occur in hidden locations (e.g., the cervix or anus), infected individuals sometimes do
     not notice them.

     The secondary stage generally develops once the primary chancre has healed or begun to heal. Secondary syphilis is
     characterized by a rash that affects the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth, vagina, or anus. The rash often
     begins on the palms or the soles of the feet and spreads to the trunk and the limbs (Figure 23.12). The rash may
     take many forms, such as macular or papular. On mucous membranes, it may manifest as mucus patches or white,
     wartlike lesions called condylomata lata. The rash may be accompanied by malaise, fever, and swelling of lymph
     nodes. Individuals are highly contagious in the secondary stage, which lasts two to six weeks and is recurrent in
     about 25% of cases.

     After the secondary phase, syphilis can enter a latent phase, in which there are no symptoms but microbial levels
     remain high. Blood tests can still detect the disease during latency. The latent phase can persist for years.

     Tertiary syphilis, which may occur 10 to 20 years after infection, produces the most severe symptoms and can be
     fatal. Granulomatous lesions called gummas may develop in a variety of locations, including mucous membranes,
     bones, and internal organs (Figure 23.12). Gummas can be large and destructive, potentially causing massive tissue
     damage. The most deadly lesions are those of the cardiovascular system (cardiovascular syphilis) and the central
     nervous system (neurosyphilis). Cardiovascular syphilis can result in a fatal aortic aneurysm (rupture of the aorta) or
     coronary stenosis (a blockage of the coronary artery). Damage to the central nervous system can cause dementia,
     personality changes, seizures, general paralysis, speech impairment, loss of vision and hearing, and loss of bowel
     and bladder control.

for Disease Control and Prevention)

The recommended methods for diagnosing early syphilis are darkfield or brightfield (silver stain) microscopy of
tissue or exudate from lesions to detect T. pallidum (Figure 23.13). If these methods are not available, two types of
serologic tests (treponemal and nontreponemal) can be used for a presumptive diagnosis once the spirochete has
spread in the body. Nontreponemal serologic tests include the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and
rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests. These are similar screening tests that detect nonspecific antibodies (those for lipid
antigens produced during infection) rather than those produced against the spirochete. Treponemal serologic tests
measure antibodies directed against T. pallidum antigens using particle agglutination (T. pallidum passive particle
agglutination or TP-PA), immunofluorescence (the fluorescent T. pallidum antibody absorption or FTA-ABS), various
enzyme reactions (enzyme immunoassays or EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA). Confirmatory
testing, rather than screening, must be done using treponemal rather than nontreponemal tests because only the
former tests for antibodies to spirochete antigens. Both treponemal and nontreponemal tests should be used (as
opposed to just one) since both tests have limitations than can result in false positives or false negatives.

Neurosyphilis cannot be diagnosed using a single test. With or without clinical signs, it is generally necessary to
assess a variety of factors, including reactive serologic test results, cerebrospinal fluid cell count abnormalities,
cerebrospinal fluid protein abnormalities, or reactive VDRL-CSF (the VDRL test of cerebrospinal fluid). The VDRL-CSF
is highly specific, but not sufficiently sensitive for conclusive diagnosis.

The recommended treatment for syphilis is parenteral penicillin G (especially long-acting benzathine penicillin,
although the exact choice depends on the stage of disease). Other options include tetracycline and doxycycline.

Congenital Syphilis
Congenital syphilis is passed during pregnancy to a fetus when untreated primary or secondary syphilis is present.
In many cases, infection may lead to miscarriage or stillbirth. Children born with congenital syphilis show symptoms
of secondary syphilis and may develop mucus patches that deform the nose. In infants, gummas can cause
significant tissue damage to organs and teeth. Many other complications may develop, such as osteochondritis,
anemia, blindness, bone deformations, neurosyphilis, and cardiovascular lesions. Because congenital syphilis poses
such a risk to the fetus, people are screened for syphilis infection during the first trimester of pregnancy as part of

     Chancroid

     The sexually transmitted infection chancroid is caused by the gram-negative rod Haemophilus ducreyi. It is
     characterized by soft chancres (Figure 23.14) on the genitals or other areas associated with sexual contact, such as
     the mouth and anus. Unlike the hard chancres associated with syphilis, soft chancres develop into painful, open
     sores that may bleed or produce fluid that is highly contagious. In addition to causing chancres, the bacteria can
     invade the lymph nodes, potentially leading to pus discharge through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin. Like
     other genital lesions, soft chancres are of particular concern because they compromise the protective barriers of the
     skin or mucous membranes, making individuals more susceptible to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

     Several virulence factors have been associated with H. ducreyi, including lipooligosaccharides, protective outer
     membrane proteins, antiphagocytic proteins, secretory proteins, and collagen-specific adhesin NcaA. The collagen-
     specific adhesion NcaA plays an important role in initial cellular attachment and colonization. Outer membrane
     proteins DsrA and DltA have been shown to provide protection from serum-mediated killing by antibodies and
     complement.

     H. ducreyi is difficult to culture; thus, diagnosis is generally based on clinical observation of genital ulcers and tests
     that rule out other diseases with similar ulcers, such as syphilis and genital herpes. PCR tests for H. ducreyi have
     been developed in some laboratories, but as of 2015 none had been cleared by the US Food and Drug
     Administration (FDA).7 Recommended treatments for chancroid include antibiotics such as azithromycin,
     ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and ceftriaxone. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin has been reported.8

Bacterial Reproductive Tract Infections

Many bacterial infections affecting the reproductive system are transmitted through sexual contact, but some
can be transmitted by other means. In the United States, gonorrhea and chlamydia are common illnesses with
incidences of about 350,000 and 1.44 million, respectively, in 2014. Syphilis is a rarer disease with an incidence
of 20,000 in 2014. Chancroid is exceedingly rare in the United States with only six cases in 2014 and a median
of 10 cases per year for the years 2010-2014.9 Figure 23.15 summarizes bacterial infections of the

Several viruses can cause serious problems for the human reproductive system. Most of these viral infections are
incurable, increasing the risk of persistent sexual transmission. In addition, such viral infections are very common in
the United States. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI in the country, with an
estimated prevalence of 79.1 million infections in 2008; herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is the next most prevalent
STI at 24.1 million infections.10 In this section, we will examine these and other major viral infections of the
reproductive system.

Genital Herpes

Genital herpes is a common condition caused by the herpes simplex virus (Figure 23.16), an enveloped, double-
stranded DNA virus that is classified into two distinct types. Herpes simplex virus has several virulence factors,
including infected cell protein (ICP) 34.5, which helps in replication and inhibits the maturation of dendritic cells as
a mechanism of avoiding elimination by the immune system. In addition, surface glycoproteins on the viral envelope
promote the coating of herpes simplex virus with antibodies and complement factors, allowing the virus to appear
as "self" and prevent immune system activation and elimination.

There are two herpes simplex virus types. While herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is generally associated with
oral lesions like cold sores or fever blisters (see Viral Infections of the Skin and Eyes), herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) is usually associated with genital herpes. However, both viruses can infect either location as well as other
parts of the body. Oral-genital contact can spread either virus from the mouth to the genital region or vice versa.

FIGURE 23.16 Virions of the herpes simplex virus are shown here in this transmission electron micrograph. (credit: modification of work by
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Many infected individuals do not develop symptoms, and thus do not realize that they carry the virus. However, in
some infected individuals, fever, chills, malaise, swollen lymph nodes, and pain precede the development of fluid-
filled vesicles that may be irritating and uncomfortable. When these vesicles burst, they release infectious fluid and
allow transmission of HSV. In addition, open herpes lesions can increase the risk of spreading or acquiring HIV.
In males, the herpes lesions typically develop on the penis and may be accompanied by a watery discharge. In
females, the vesicles develop most commonly on the vulva, but may also develop on the vagina or cervix (Figure
23.17). The symptoms are typically mild, although the lesions may be irritating or accompanied by urinary
discomfort. Use of condoms may not always be an effective means of preventing transmission of genital herpes
since the lesions can occur on areas other than the genitals.

     FIGURE 23.17 Genital herpes is typically characterized by lesions on the genitals (left), but lesions can also appear elsewhere on the skin
     or mucous membranes (right). The lesions can be large and painful or small and easily overlooked. (credit b: modification of work by
     Schiffer JT, Swan D, Al Sallaq R, Magaret A, Johnston C, Mark KE, Selke S, Ocbamichael N, Kuntz S, Zhu J, Robinson B, Huang ML, Jerome
     KR, Wald A, and Corey)

     Herpes simplex viruses can cause recurrent infections because the virus can become latent and then be reactivated.
     This occurs more commonly with HSV-2 than with HSV-1.11 The virus moves down peripheral nerves, typically
     sensory neurons, to ganglia in the spine (either the trigeminal ganglion or the lumbar-sacral ganglia) and becomes
     latent. Reactivation can later occur, causing the formation of new vesicles. HSV-2 most effectively reactivates from
     the lumbar-sacral ganglia. Not everyone infected with HSV-2 experiences reactivations, which are typically
     associated with stressful conditions, and the frequency of reactivation varies throughout life and among individuals.
     Between outbreaks or when there are no obvious vesicles, the virus can still be transmitted.

     Virologic and serologic techniques are used for diagnosis. The virus may be cultured from lesions. The
     immunostaining methods that are used to detect virus from cultures generally require less expertise than methods
     based on cytopathic effect (CPE), as well as being a less expensive option. However, PCR or other DNA amplification
     methods may be preferred because they provide the most rapid results without waiting for culture amplification.
     PCR is also best for detecting systemic infections. Serologic techniques are also useful in some circumstances, such
     as when symptoms persist but PCR testing is negative.

     While there is no cure or vaccine for HSV-2 infections, antiviral medications are available that manage the infection
     by keeping the virus in its dormant or latent phase, reducing signs and symptoms. If the medication is discontinued,
     then the condition returns to its original severity. The recommended medications, which may be taken at the start of
     an outbreak or daily as a method of prophylaxis, are acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir.

     Neonatal Herpes
     Herpes infections in newborns, referred to as neonatal herpes, are generally transmitted to the neonate during
     childbirth, when the child is exposed to pathogens in the birth canal. Infections can occur regardless of whether
     lesions are present in the birth canal. In most cases, the infection of the newborn is limited to skin, mucous
     membranes, and eyes, and outcomes are good. However, sometimes the virus becomes disseminated and spreads
     to the central nervous system, resulting in motor function deficits or death.

     In some cases, infections can occur before birth when the virus crosses the placenta. This can cause serious
     complications in fetal development and may result in spontaneous abortion or severe disabilities if the fetus
     survives. The condition is most serious when the person is infected with HSV for the first time during pregnancy.
     Thus, people are screened for HSV infection during the first trimester of pregnancy as part of the TORCH panel of
     prenatal tests (see How Pathogens Cause Disease). Systemic acyclovir treatment is recommended to treat
     newborns with neonatal herpes.

Human Papillomas

Warts of all types are caused by a variety of strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) (see Viral Infections of the Skin
and Eyes). Condylomata acuminata, more commonly called genital warts or venereal warts (Figure 23.18), are an
extremely prevalent STI caused by certain strains of HPV. Condylomata are irregular, soft, pink growths that are
found on external genitalia or the anus.

HPV is a small, non-enveloped virus with a circular double-stranded DNA genome. Researchers have identified over
200 different strains (called types) of HPV, with approximately 40 causing STIs. While some types of HPV cause
genital warts, HPV infection is often asymptomatic and self-limiting. However, genital HPV infection often co-occurs
with other STIs like syphilis or gonorrhea. Additionally, some forms of HPV (not the same ones associated with
genital warts) are associated with cervical cancers. At least 14 oncogenic (cancer-causing) HPV types are known to
have a causal association with cervical cancers. Examples of oncogenic HPV are types 16 and 18, which are
associated with 70% of cervical cancers.12 Oncogenic HPV types can also cause oropharyngeal cancer, anal cancer,
vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, and penile cancer. Most of these cancers are caused by HPV type 16. HPV virulence
factors include proteins (E6 and E7) that are capable of inactivating tumor suppressor proteins, leading to
uncontrolled cell division and the development of cancer.

HPV cannot be cultured, so molecular tests are the primary method used to detect HPV. While routine HPV
screening is not recommended for males, it is included in guidelines for females. An initial screening for HPV at age
30, conducted at the same time as a Pap test, is recommended. If the tests are negative, then further HPV testing is
recommended every five years. More frequent testing may be needed in some cases. The protocols used to collect,
transport, and store samples vary based on both the type of HPV testing and the purpose of the testing. This should
be determined in individual cases in consultation with the laboratory that will perform the testing.

Because HPV testing is often conducted concurrently with Pap testing, the most common approach uses a single
sample collection within one vial for both. This approach uses liquid-based cytology (LBC). The samples are then
used for Pap smear cytology as well as HPV testing and genotyping. HPV can be recognized in Pap smears by the
presence of cells called koilocytes (called koilocytosis or koilocytotic atypia). Koilocytes have a hyperchromatic
atypical nucleus that stains darkly and a high ratio of nuclear material to cytoplasm. There is a distinct clear
appearance around the nucleus called a perinuclear halo (Figure 23.19).

     Most HPV infections resolve spontaneously; however, various therapies are used to treat and remove warts. Topical
     medications such as imiquimod (which stimulates the production of interferon), podofilox, or sinecatechins, may be
     effective. Warts can also be removed using cryotherapy or surgery, but these approaches are less effective for
     genital warts than for other types of warts. Electrocauterization and carbon dioxide laser therapy are also used for
     wart removal.
     Regular Pap testing can detect abnormal cells that might progress to cervical cancer, followed by biopsy and
     appropriate treatment. Vaccines for some of the high risk HPV types are now available. Gardasil vaccine includes
     types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (types 6 and 11 are associated with 90% of genital wart infections and types 16 and 18 are
     associated with 70% of cervical cancers). Gardasil 9 vaccinates against the previous four types and an additional
     five high-risk types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). Cervarix vaccine includes just HPV types 16 and 18. Vaccination is the
     most effective way to prevent infection with oncogenic HPV, but it is important to note that not all oncogenic HPV
     types are covered by the available vaccines. It is recommended for all young people prior to sexual activity (usually
     between the ages of nine and fifteen).

     Secret STIs

     Few people who have an STI (or think they may have one) are eager to share that information publicly. In fact, many
     patients are even uncomfortable discussing the symptoms privately with their doctors. Unfortunately, the social
     stigma associated with STIs makes it harder for infected individuals to seek the treatment they need and creates the
     false perception that STIs are rare. In reality, STIs are quite common, but it is difficult to determine exactly how
     common.

A recent study on the effects of HPV vaccination found a baseline HPV prevalence of 26.8% for females between the
ages of 14 and 59. Among females aged 20-24, the prevalence was 44.8%; in other words, almost half of the
females in this age bracket had a current infection.13 According to the CDC, HSV-2 infection was estimated to have
a prevalence of 15.5% in younger individuals (14-49 years of age) in 2007-2010, down from 20.3% in the same
age group in 1988-1994. However, the CDC estimates that 87.4% of infected individuals in this age group have not
been diagnosed by a physician.14

Another complicating factor is that many STIs can be asymptomatic or have long periods of latency. For example,
the CDC estimates that among females ages 14-49 in the United States, about 2.3 million (3.1%) are infected with
the sexually transmitted protozoan Trichomonas (see Protozoan Infections of the Urogenital System); however, in a
study of infected females, 85% of those diagnosed with the infection were asymptomatic.15

Even when patients are treated for symptomatic STIs, it can be difficult to obtain accurate data on the number of
cases. Whereas STIs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are notifiable diseases--meaning each diagnosis must
be reported by healthcare providers to the CDC--other STIs are not notifiable (e.g., genital herpes, genital warts, and
trichomoniasis). Between the social taboos, the inconsistency of symptoms, and the lack of mandatory reporting, it
can be difficult to estimate the true prevalence of STIs--but it is safe to say they are much more prevalent than most
people think.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Summarize the important characteristics of vaginal candidiasis

     Only one major fungal pathogen affects the urogenital system. Candida is a genus of fungi capable of existing in a
     yeast form or as a multicellular fungus. Candida spp. are commonly found in the normal, healthy microbiota of the
     skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and female urogenital tract (Figure 23.21). They can be pathogenic
     due to their ability to adhere to and invade host cells, form biofilms, secrete hydrolases (e.g., proteases,
     phospholipases, and lipases) that assist in their spread through tissues, and change their phenotypes to protect
     themselves from the immune system. However, they typically only cause disease in the female reproductive tract
     under conditions that compromise the host's defenses. While there are at least 20 Candida species of clinical
     importance, C. albicans is the species most commonly responsible for fungal vaginitis.

     As discussed earlier, lactobacilli in the vagina inhibit the growth of other organisms, including bacteria and Candida,
     but disruptions can allow Candida to increase in numbers. Typical disruptions include antibiotic therapy, illness
     (especially diabetes), pregnancy, and the presence of transient microbes. Immunosuppression can also play a role,
     and the severe immunosuppression associated with HIV infection often allows Candida to thrive. This can cause
     genital or vaginal candidiasis, a condition characterized by vaginitis and commonly known as a yeast infection.
     When a yeast infection develops, inflammation occurs along with symptoms of pruritus (itching), a thick white or
     yellow discharge, and odor.

     Other forms of candidiasis include cutaneous candidiasis (see Mycoses of the Skin) and oral thrush (see Microbial
     Diseases of the Mouth and Oral Cavity). Although Candida spp. are found in the normal microbiota, Candida spp.
     may also be transmitted between individuals. Sexual contact is a common mode of transmission, although

candidiasis is not considered an STI.

Diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis can be made using microscopic evaluation of vaginal secretions to determine
whether there is an excess of Candida. Culturing approaches are less useful because Candida is part of the normal
microbiota and will regularly appear. It is also easy to contaminate samples with Candida because it is so common,
so care must be taken to handle clinical material appropriately. Samples can be refrigerated if there is a delay in
handling. Candida is a dimorphic fungus, so it does not only exist in a yeast form; cultivation can be used to identify
chlamydospores and pseudohyphae, which develop from germ tubes (Figure 23.22). The presence of the germ tube
can be used in a diagnostic test in which cultured yeast cells are combined with rabbit serum and observed after a
few hours for the presence of germ tubes. Molecular tests are also available if needed. The Affirm VPII Microbial
Identification Test, for instance, tests simultaneously for the vaginal microbes C. albicans, G. vaginalis (see Bacterial
Infections of the Urinary System), and Trichomonas vaginalis (see Protozoan Infections of the Urogenital System).

Topical antifungal medications for vaginal candidiasis include butoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, tioconazole,
and nystatin. Oral treatment with fluconazole can be used. There are often no clear precipitating factors for

     The Gram stain of Nadia's vaginal smear showed that the concentration of lactobacilli relative to other species in
     Nadia's vaginal sample was abnormally low. However, there were no clue cells visible, which suggests that the
     infection is not bacterial vaginosis. But a wet-mount slide showed an overgrowth of yeast cells, suggesting that
     the problem is candidiasis, or a yeast infection (Figure 23.23). This, Nadia's doctor assures her, is good news.
     Candidiasis is common during pregnancy and easily treatable.

     23.6 Protozoan Infections of the Urogenital System

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the most common protozoan pathogen that causes infections of the reproductive system
         · Summarize the important characteristics of trichomoniasis

     Only one major protozoan species causes infections in the urogenital system. Trichomoniasis, or "trich," is the most
     common nonviral STI and is caused by a flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis has an undulating
     membrane and, generally, an amoeboid shape when attached to cells in the vagina. In culture, it has an oval shape.

     T. vaginalis is commonly found in the normal microbiota of the vagina. As with other vaginal pathogens, it can cause
     vaginitis when there is disruption to the normal microbiota. It is found only as a trophozoite and does not form cysts.
     T. vaginalis can adhere to cells using adhesins such as lipoglycans; it also has other cell-surface virulence factors,
     including tetraspanins that are involved in cell adhesion, motility, and tissue invasion. In addition, T. vaginalis is
     capable of phagocytosing other microbes of the normal microbiota, contributing to the development of an
     imbalance that is favorable to infection.

     Anyone can develop trichomoniasis. Males are generally asymptomatic, and although females are more likely to
     develop symptoms, they are often asymptomatic as well. When symptoms do occur, they are characteristic of
     urethritis. Males experience itching, irritation, discharge from the penis, and burning after urination or ejaculation.
     Females experience dysuria; itching, burning, redness, and soreness of the genitalia; and vaginal discharge. The
     infection may also spread to the cervix. Infection increases the risk of transmitting or acquiring HIV and is
     associated with pregnancy complications such as preterm birth.

Microscopic evaluation of wet mounts is an inexpensive and convenient method of diagnosis, but the sensitivity of
this method is low (Figure 23.24). Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is preferred due to its high sensitivity.
Using wet mounts and then NAAT for those who initially test negative is one option to improve sensitivity. Samples
may be obtained for NAAT using urine, vaginal, or endocervical specimens for females and with urine and urethral
swabs for males. It is also possible to use other methods such as the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (an
immunochromatographic test that detects antigen) and a DNA probe test for multiple species associated with
vaginitis (the Affirm VPII Microbial Identification Test discussed in section 23.5).16 T. vaginalis is sometimes
detected on a Pap test, but this is not considered diagnostic due to high rates of false positives and negatives. The
recommended treatment for trichomoniasis is oral metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners should be treated as
well.

  EYE ON ETHICS
  STIs and Privacy

  For many STIs, it is common to contact and treat sexual partners of the patient. This is especially important
  when a new illness has appeared, as when HIV became more prevalent in the 1980s. But to contact sexual
  partners, it is necessary to obtain their personal information from the patient. This raises difficult questions. In
  some cases, providing the information may be embarrassing or difficult for the patient, even though withholding
  such information could put their sexual partner(s) at risk.

  Legal considerations further complicate such situations. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  (HIPPA), passed into law in 1996, sets the standards for the protection of patient information. It requires
  businesses that use health information, such as insurance companies and healthcare providers, to maintain
  strict confidentiality of patient records. Contacting a patient's sexual partners may therefore violate the patient's
  privacy rights if the patient's diagnosis is revealed as a result.

  From an ethical standpoint, which is more important: the patient's privacy rights or the sexual partner's right to
  know that they may be at risk of a sexually transmitted disease? Does the answer depend on the severity of the
  disease or are the rules universal? Suppose the physician knows the identity of the sexual partner but the
  patient does not want that individual to be contacted. Would it be a violation of HIPPA rules to contact the
  individual without the patient's consent?

     Questions related to patient privacy become even more complicated when dealing with patients who are minors.
     Adolescents may be reluctant to discuss their sexual behavior or health with a health professional, especially if
     they believe that healthcare professionals will tell their parents. This leaves many teens at risk of having an
     untreated infection or of lacking the information to protect themselves and their partners. On the other hand,
     parents may feel that they have a right to know what is going on with their child. How should physicians handle
     this? Should parents always be told even if the adolescent wants confidentiality? Does this affect how the
     physician should handle notifying a sexual partner?

     CLINICAL FOCUS

     Resolution

     Vaginal candidiasis is generally treated using topical antifungal medications such as butoconazole, miconazole,
     clotrimazole, ticonozole, nystatin, or oral fluconazole. However, it is important to be careful in selecting a
     treatment for use during pregnancy. Nadia's doctor recommended treatment with topical clotrimazole. This drug
     is classified as a category B drug by the FDA for use in pregnancy, and there appears to be no evidence of harm,
     at least in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Based on Nadia's particular situation, her doctor thought
     that it was suitable for very short-term use even though she was still in the first trimester. After a seven-day
     course of treatment, Nadia's yeast infection cleared. She continued with a normal pregnancy and delivered a
     healthy baby eight months later.

     Higher levels of hormones during pregnancy can shift the typical microbiota composition and balance in the
     vagina, leading to high rates of infections such as candidiasis or vaginosis. Topical treatment has an 80-90%
     success rate, with only a small number of cases resulting in recurrent or persistent infections. Longer term or
     intermittent treatment is usually effective in these cases.

INTRODUCTION Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are so common that, unfortunately, most people have had first-
hand experience with the unpleasant symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. The causes
of gastrointestinal illness can vary widely, but such diseases can be grouped into two categories: those caused by
infection (the growth of a pathogen in the GI tract) or intoxication (the presence of a microbial toxin in the GI tract).
Foodborne pathogens like Escherichia coli O157:H7 are among the most common sources of gastrointestinal
disease. Contaminated food and water have always posed a health risk for humans, but in today's global economy,
outbreaks can occur on a much larger scale. E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly strain of E. coli with a history of
contaminating meat and produce that are not properly processed. The source of an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak can be
difficult to trace, especially if the contaminated food is processed in a foreign country. Once the source is identified,
authorities may issue recalls of the contaminated food products, but by then there are typically numerous cases of
food poisoning, some of them fatal.

       CLINICAL FOCUS

       Part 1

       After a morning of playing outside, four-year-old Carli ran inside for lunch. After taking a bite of her fried egg, she
       pushed it away and whined, "It's too slimy, Mommy. I don't want any more." But her mother, in no mood for
       games, curtly replied that if she wanted to go back outside she had better finish her lunch. Reluctantly, Carli
       complied, trying hard not to gag as she choked down the runny egg.

       That night, Carli woke up feeling nauseated. She cried for her parents and then began to vomit. Her parents tried
       to comfort her, but she continued to vomit all night and began to have diarrhea and run a fever. By the morning,
       her parents were very worried. They rushed her to the emergency room.

     The human digestive system, or the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, begins with the mouth and ends with the anus. The
     parts of the mouth include the teeth, the gums, the tongue, the oral vestibule (the space between the gums, lips,
     and teeth), and the oral cavity proper (the space behind the teeth and gums). Other parts of the GI tract are the
     pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus (Figure 24.2). Accessory digestive
     organs include the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas.

     The digestive system contains normal microbiota, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists, and even viruses.
     Because this microbiota is important for normal functioning of the digestive system, alterations to the microbiota by
     antibiotics or diet can be harmful. Additionally, the introduction of pathogens to the GI tract can cause infections
     and diseases. In this section, we will review the microbiota found in a healthy digestive tract and the general signs
     and symptoms associated with oral and GI infections.

Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the Oral Cavity

Food enters the digestive tract through the mouth, where mechanical digestion (by chewing) and chemical digestion
(by enzymes in saliva) begin. Within the mouth are the tongue, teeth, and salivary glands, including the parotid,
sublingual, and submandibular glands (Figure 24.3). The salivary glands produce saliva, which lubricates food and
952  24 · Digestive System Infections

     contains digestive enzymes.

     The structure of a tooth (Figure 24.4) begins with the visible outer surface, called the crown, which has to be
     extremely hard to withstand the force of biting and chewing. The crown is covered with enamel, which is the hardest
     material in the body. Underneath the crown, a layer of relatively hard dentin extends into the root of the tooth
     around the innermost pulp cavity, which includes the pulp chamber at the top of the tooth and pulp canal, or root
     canal, located in the root. The pulp that fills the pulp cavity is rich in blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, connective
     tissue, and nerves. The root of the tooth and some of the crown are covered with cementum, which works with the
     periodontal ligament to anchor the tooth in place in the jaw bone. The soft tissues surrounding the teeth and bones
     are called gums, or gingiva. The gingival space or gingival crevice is located between the gums and teeth.

     contains the pulp canal (root canal). (credit: modification of work by Bruce Blaus)

     Microbes such as bacteria and archaea are abundant in the mouth and coat all of the surfaces of the oral cavity.
     However, different structures, such as the teeth or cheeks, host unique communities of both aerobic and anaerobic
     microbes. Some factors appear to work against making the mouth hospitable to certain microbes. For example,
     chewing allows microbes to mix better with saliva so they can be swallowed or spit out more easily. Saliva also
     contains enzymes, including lysozyme, which can damage microbial cells. Recall that lysozyme is part of the first

acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) in bacterial peptidoglycan (see Chemical Defenses).
Additionally, fluids containing immunoglobulins and phagocytic cells are produced in the gingival spaces. Despite all
of these chemical and mechanical activities, the mouth supports a large microbial community.

Anatomy and Normal Microbiota of the GI Tract

As food leaves the oral cavity, it travels through the pharynx, or the back of the throat, and moves into the
esophagus, which carries the food from the pharynx to the stomach without adding any additional digestive
enzymes. The stomach produces mucus to protect its lining, as well as digestive enzymes and acid to break down
food. Partially digested food then leaves the stomach through the pyloric sphincter, reaching the first part of the
small intestine called the duodenum. Pancreatic juice, which includes enzymes and bicarbonate ions, is released
into the small intestine to neutralize the acidic material from the stomach and to assist in digestion. Bile, produced
by the liver but stored in the gallbladder, is also released into the small intestine to emulsify fats so that they can
travel in the watery environment of the small intestine. Digestion continues in the small intestine, where the majority
of nutrients contained in the food are absorbed. Simple columnar epithelial cells called enterocytes line the lumen
surface of the small intestinal folds called villi. Each enterocyte has smaller microvilli (cytoplasmic membrane
extensions) on the cellular apical surface that increase the surface area to allow more absorption of nutrients to
occur (Figure 24.5).

     Digested food leaves the small intestine and moves into the large intestine, or colon, where there is a more diverse
     microbiota. Near this junction, there is a small pouch in the large intestine called the cecum, which attaches to the
     appendix. Further digestion occurs throughout the colon and water is reabsorbed, then waste is excreted through
     the rectum, the last section of the colon, and out of the body through the anus (Figure 24.2).

     The environment of most of the GI tract is harsh, which serves two purposes: digestion and immunity. The stomach
     is an extremely acidic environment (pH 1.5-3.5) due to the gastric juices that break down food and kill many
     ingested microbes; this helps prevent infection from pathogens. The environment in the small intestine is less harsh
     and is able to support microbial communities. Microorganisms present in the small intestine can include lactobacilli,
     diptherioids and the fungus Candida. On the other hand, the large intestine (colon) contains a diverse and abundant
     microbiota that is important for normal function. These microbes include Bacteriodetes (especially the genera
     Bacteroides and Prevotella) and Firmicutes (especially members of the genus Clostridium). Methanogenic archaea
     and some fungi are also present, among many other species of bacteria. These microbes all aid in digestion and
     contribute to the production of feces, the waste excreted from the digestive tract, and flatus, the gas produced from
     microbial fermentation of undigested food. They can also produce valuable nutrients. For example, lactic acid
     bacteria such as bifidobacteria can synthesize vitamins, such as vitamin B12, folate, and riboflavin, that humans
     cannot synthesize themselves. E. coli found in the intestine can also break down food and help the body produce
     vitamin K, which is important for blood coagulation.

     The GI tract has several other methods of reducing the risk of infection by pathogens. Small aggregates of

underlying lymphoid tissue in the ileum, called Peyer's patches (Figure 24.5), detect pathogens in the intestines via
microfold (M) cells, which transfer antigens from the lumen of the intestine to the lymphocytes on Peyer's patches
to induce an immune response. The Peyer's patches then secrete IgA and other pathogen-specific antibodies into
the intestinal lumen to help keep intestinal microbes at safe levels. Goblet cells, which are modified simple
columnar epithelial cells, also line the GI tract (Figure 24.6). Goblet cells secrete a gel-forming mucin, which is the
major component of mucus. The production of a protective layer of mucus helps reduce the risk of pathogens
reaching deeper tissues.

The constant movement of materials through the gastrointestinal tract also helps to move transient pathogens out
of the body. In fact, feces are composed of approximately 25% microbes, 25% sloughed epithelial cells, 25%
mucus, and 25% digested or undigested food. Finally, the normal microbiota provides an additional barrier to
infection via a variety of mechanisms. For example, these organisms outcompete potential pathogens for space and
nutrients within the intestine. This is known as competitive exclusion. Members of the microbiota may also secrete
protein toxins known as bacteriocins that are able to bind to specific receptors on the surface of susceptible
bacteria.

General Signs and Symptoms of Oral and GI Disease

Despite numerous defense mechanisms that protect against infection, all parts of the digestive tract can become
sites of infection or intoxication. The term food poisoning is sometimes used as a catch-all for GI infections and
intoxications, but not all forms of GI disease originate with foodborne pathogens or toxins.

In the mouth, fermentation by anaerobic microbes produces acids that damage the teeth and gums. This can lead to
tooth decay, cavities, and periodontal disease, a condition characterized by chronic inflammation and erosion of
the gums. Additionally, some pathogens can cause infections of the mucosa, glands, and other structures in the
mouth, resulting in inflammation, sores, cankers, and other lesions. An open sore in the mouth or GI tract is typically
called an ulcer.

Infections and intoxications of the lower GI tract often produce symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
aches, and fever. In some cases, vomiting and diarrhea may cause severe dehydration and other complications that
can become serious or fatal. Various clinical terms are used to describe gastrointestinal symptoms. For example,
956  24 · Digestive System Infections

     gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining that results in swelling and enteritis refers to inflammation of the
     intestinal mucosa. When the inflammation involves both the stomach lining and the intestinal lining, the condition is
     called gastroenteritis. Inflammation of the liver is called hepatitis. Inflammation of the colon, called colitis,
     commonly occurs in cases of food intoxication. Because an inflamed colon does not reabsorb water as effectively as
     it normally does, stools become watery, causing diarrhea. Damage to the epithelial cells of the colon can also cause
     bleeding and excess mucus to appear in watery stools, a condition called dysentery.

     24.2 Microbial Diseases of the Mouth and Oral Cavity

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the role of microbial activity in diseases of the mouth and oral cavity
         · Compare the major characteristics of specific oral diseases and infections

     Despite the presence of saliva and the mechanical forces of chewing and eating, some microbes thrive in the mouth.
     These microbes can cause damage to the teeth and can cause infections that have the potential to spread beyond
     the mouth and sometimes throughout the body.

     Dental Caries

     Cavities of the teeth, known clinically as dental caries, are microbial lesions that cause damage to the teeth. Over
     time, the lesion can grow through the outer enamel layer to infect the underlying dentin or even the innermost pulp.
     If dental caries are not treated, the infection can become an abscess that spreads to the deeper tissues of the teeth,
     near the roots, or to the bloodstream.

     Tooth decay results from the metabolic activity of microbes that live on the teeth. A layer of proteins and
     carbohydrates forms when clean teeth come into contact with saliva. Microbes are attracted to this food source and
     form a biofilm called plaque. The most important cariogenic species in these biofilms is Streptococcus mutans.
     When sucrose, a disaccharide sugar from food, is broken down by bacteria in the mouth, glucose and fructose are
     produced. The glucose is used to make dextran, which is part of the extracellular matrix of the biofilm. Fructose is
     fermented, producing organic acids such as lactic acid. These acids dissolve the minerals of the tooth, including
     enamel, even though it is the hardest material in the body. The acids work even more quickly on exposed dentin
     (Figure 24.7). Over time, the plaque biofilm can become thick and eventually calcify. When a heavy plaque deposit
     becomes hardened in this way, it is called tartar or dental calculus (Figure 24.8). These substantial plaque biofilms
     can include a variety of bacterial species, including Streptococcus and Actinomyces species.

FIGURE 24.7 Tooth decay occurs in stages. When bacterial biofilms (plaque) develop on teeth, the acids produced gradually dissolve the
enamel, followed by the dentin. Eventually, if left untreated, the lesion may reach the pulp and cause an abscess. (credit: modification of

decay inside the tooth. (d) Removal of a portion of the crown reveals the area of damage. (e) All of the cavity must be removed before filling.

Some tooth decay is visible from the outside, but it is not always possible to see all decay or the extent of the decay.
X-ray imaging is used to produce radiographs that can be studied to look for deeper decay and damage to the root or
bone (Figure 24.8). If not detected, the decay can reach the pulp or even spread to the bloodstream. Painful
abscesses can develop.
To prevent tooth decay, prophylactic treatment and good hygiene are important. Regular tooth brushing and flossing
physically removes microbes and combats microbial growth and biofilm formation. Toothpaste contains fluoride,
958  24 · Digestive System Infections

     which becomes incorporated into the hydroxyapatite of tooth enamel, protecting it against acidity caused by
     fermentation of mouth microbiota. Fluoride is also bacteriostatic, thus slowing enamel degradation. Antiseptic
     mouthwashes commonly contain plant-derived phenolics like thymol and eucalyptol and/or heavy metals like zinc
     chloride (see Using Chemicals to Control Microorganisms). Phenolics tend to be stable and persistent on surfaces,
     and they act through denaturing proteins and disrupting membranes.

     Regular dental cleanings allow for the detection of decay at early stages and the removal of tartar. They may also
     help to draw attention to other concerns, such as damage to the enamel from acidic drinks. Reducing sugar
     consumption may help prevent damage that results from the microbial fermentation of sugars. Additionally,
     sugarless candies or gum with sugar alcohols (such as xylitol) can reduce the production of acids because these are
     fermented to nonacidic compounds (although excess consumption may lead to gastrointestinal distress). Fluoride
     treatment or ingesting fluoridated water strengthens the minerals in teeth and reduces the incidence of dental
     caries.

     If caries develop, prompt treatment prevents worsening. Smaller areas of decay can be drilled to remove affected
     tissue and then filled. If the pulp is affected, then a root canal may be needed to completely remove the infected
     tissues to avoid continued spread of the infection, which could lead to painful abscesses.

     Periodontal Disease

     In addition to damage to the teeth themselves, the surrounding structures can be affected by microbes. Periodontal
     disease is the result of infections that lead to inflammation and tissue damage in the structures surrounding the
     teeth. The progression from mild to severe periodontal disease is generally reversible and preventable with good
     oral hygiene.

     Inflammation of the gums that can lead to irritation and bleeding is called gingivitis. When plaque accumulates on
     the teeth, bacteria colonize the gingival space. As this space becomes increasingly blocked, the environment
     becomes anaerobic. This allows a wide variety of microbes to colonize, including Porphyromonas, Streptococcus,
     and Actinomyces. The bacterial products, which include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proteases, lipoteichoic acids, and
     others, cause inflammation and gum damage (Figure 24.9). It is possible that methanogenic archaeans (including
     Methanobrevibacter oralis and other Methanobrevibacter species) also contribute to disease progression as some
     species have been identified in patients with periodontal disease, but this has proven difficult to study.1 2 3
     Gingivitis is diagnosed by visual inspection, including measuring pockets in the gums, and X-rays, and is usually
     treated using good dental hygiene and professional dental cleaning, with antibiotics reserved for severe cases.

unprotected, so bacteria can grow on it and spread underneath the enamel of the crown and cause cavities. Bacteria

cementum can lead to the movement or loss of teeth. The bones of the jaw can even erode if the infection spreads.
This condition can be associated with bleeding and halitosis (bad breath). Cleaning and appropriate dental hygiene
may be sufficient to treat periodontitis. However, in cases of severe periodontitis, an antibiotic may be given.
Antibiotics may be given in pill form or applied directly to the gum (local treatment). Antibiotics given can include
tetracycline, doxycycline, macrolides or -lactams. Because periodontitis can be caused by a mix of microbes, a
combination of antibiotics may be given.

Trench Mouth
When certain bacteria, such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium species, and Treponema vicentii, are involved
and periodontal disease progresses, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or trench mouth, also called Vincent's
disease, can develop. This is severe periodontitis characterized by erosion of the gums, ulcers, substantial pain with
chewing, and halitosis (Figure 24.11) that can be diagnosed by visual examination and X-rays. In countries with
good medical and dental care, it is most common in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as patients
with AIDS. In addition to cleaning and pain medication, patients may be prescribed antibiotics such as amoxicillin,
amoxicillin clavulanate, clindamycin, or doxycycline.

     Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body

     Good oral health promotes good overall health, and the reverse is also true. Poor oral health can lead to difficulty
     eating, which can cause malnutrition. Painful or loose teeth can also cause a person to avoid certain foods or eat
     less. Malnutrition due to dental problems is of greatest concern for the elderly, for whom it can worsen other health
     conditions and contribute to mortality. Individuals who have serious illnesses, especially AIDS, are also at increased
     risk of malnutrition from dental problems.
     Additionally, poor oral health can contribute to the development of disease. Increased bacterial growth in the mouth
     can cause inflammation and infection in other parts of the body. For example, Streptococcus in the mouth, the main
     contributor to biofilms on teeth, tartar, and dental caries, can spread throughout the body when there is damage to
     the tissues inside the mouth, as can happen during dental work. S. mutans produces a surface adhesin known as P1,
     which binds to salivary agglutinin on the surface of the tooth. P1 can also bind to extracellular matrix proteins
     including fibronectin and collagen. When Streptococcus enters the bloodstream as a result of tooth brushing or
     dental cleaning, it causes inflammation that can lead to the accumulation of plaque in the arteries and contribute to
     the development of atherosclerosis, a condition associated with cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke. In
     some cases, bacteria that spread through the blood vessels can lodge in the heart and cause endocarditis (an
     example of a focal infection).

     Oral Infections

     As noted earlier, normal oral microbiota can cause dental and periodontal infections. However, there are number of
     other infections that can manifest in the oral cavity when other microbes are present.
     Herpetic Gingivostomatitis

manifest as oral herpes, also called acute herpes labialis and characterized by cold sores on the lips, mouth, or
gums. HSV-1 can also cause acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, a condition that results in ulcers of the mucous
membranes inside the mouth (Figure 24.12). Herpetic gingivostomatitis is normally self-limiting except in
immunocompromised patients. Like oral herpes, the infection is generally diagnosed through clinical examination,
but cultures or biopsies may be obtained if other signs or symptoms suggest the possibility of a different causative
agent. If treatment is needed, mouthwashes or antiviral medications such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir
may be used.

Oral Thrush
The yeast Candida is part of the normal human microbiota, but overgrowths, especially of Candida albicans, can lead
to infections in several parts of the body. When Candida infection develops in the oral cavity, it is called oral thrush.
Oral thrush is most common in infants because they do not yet have well developed immune systems and have not
acquired the robust normal microbiota that keeps Candida in check in adults. Oral thrush is also common in
immunodeficient patients and is a common infection in patients with AIDS.
Oral thrush is characterized by the appearance of white patches and pseudomembranes in the mouth (Figure 24.13)
and can be associated with bleeding. The infection may be treated topically with nystatin or clotrimazole oral
suspensions, although systemic treatment is sometimes needed. In serious cases, systemic azoles such as
fluconazole or itraconazole (for strains resistant to fluconazole), may be used. Amphotericin B can also be used if
the infection is severe or if the Candida species is azole-resistant.

     Mumps
     The viral disease mumps is an infection of the parotid glands, the largest of the three pairs of salivary glands (Figure
     24.3). The causative agent is mumps virus (MuV), a paramyxovirus with an envelope that has hemagglutinin and
     neuraminidase spikes. A fusion protein located on the surface of the envelope helps to fuse the viral envelope to the
     host cell plasma membrane.

     Mumps virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets or through contact with contaminated saliva, making it
     quite contagious so that it can lead easily to epidemics. It causes fever, muscle pain, headache, pain with chewing,
     loss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness. There is swelling of the salivary glands and associated pain (Figure 24.14).
     The virus can enter the bloodstream (viremia), allowing it to spread to the organs and the central nervous system.
     The infection ranges from subclinical cases to cases with serious complications, such as encephalitis, meningitis,
     and deafness. Inflammation of the pancreas, testes, ovaries, and breasts may also occur and cause permanent
     damage to those organs; despite these complications, a mumps infection rarely cause sterility.

     Mumps can be recognized based on clinical signs and symptoms, and a diagnosis can be confirmed with laboratory
     testing. The virus can be identified using culture or molecular techniques such as RT-PCR. Serologic tests are also
     available, especially enzyme immunoassays that detect antibodies. There is no specific treatment for mumps, so
     supportive therapies are used. The most effective way to avoid infection is through vaccination. Although mumps
     used to be a common childhood disease, it is now rare in the United States due to vaccination with the measles,
     mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

24.3 Bacterial Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common bacteria that can cause infections of the GI tract
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific bacterial diseases affecting the GI tract

A wide range of gastrointestinal diseases are caused by bacterial contamination of food. Recall that foodborne
disease can arise from either infection or intoxication. In both cases, bacterial toxins are typically responsible for
producing disease signs and symptoms. The distinction lies in where the toxins are produced. In an infection, the
microbial agent is ingested, colonizes the gut, and then produces toxins that damage host cells. In an intoxication,
964  24 · Digestive System Infections

     bacteria produce toxins in the food before it is ingested. In either case, the toxins cause damage to the cells lining
     the gastrointestinal tract, typically the colon. This leads to the common signs and symptoms of diarrhea or watery
     stool and abdominal cramps, or the more severe dysentery. Symptoms of foodborne diseases also often include
     nausea and vomiting, which are mechanisms the body uses to expel the toxic materials.

     Most bacterial gastrointestinal illness is short-lived and self-limiting; however, loss of fluids due to severe diarrheal
     illness can lead to dehydration that can, in some cases, be fatal without proper treatment. Oral rehydration therapy
     with electrolyte solutions is an essential aspect of treatment for most patients with GI disease, especially in children
     and infants.

     Staphylococcal Food Poisoning

     Staphylococcal food poisoning is one form of food intoxication. When Staphylococcus aureus grows in food, it may
     produce enterotoxins that, when ingested, can cause symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, cramping, and vomiting
     within one to six hours. In some severe cases, it may cause headache, dehydration, and changes in blood pressure
     and heart rate. Signs and symptoms resolve within 24 to 48 hours. S. aureus is often associated with a variety of raw
     or undercooked and cooked foods including meat (e.g., canned meat, ham, and sausages) and dairy products (e.g.,
     cheeses, milk, and butter). It is also commonly found on hands and can be transmitted to prepared foods through
     poor hygiene, including poor handwashing and the use of contaminated food preparation surfaces, such as cutting
     boards. The greatest risk is for food left at a temperature below 60 °C (140 °F), which allows the bacteria to grow.
     Cooked foods should generally be reheated to at least 60 °C (140 °F) for safety and most raw meats should be
     cooked to even higher internal temperatures (Figure 24.16).

     FIGURE 24.16 This figure indicates safe internal temperatures associated with the refrigeration, cooking, and reheating of different foods.
     Temperatures above refrigeration and below the minimum cooking temperature may allow for microbial growth, increasing the likelihood of
     foodborne disease. (credit: modification of work by USDA)

     There are at least 21 Staphylococcal enterotoxins and Staphylococcal enterotoxin-like toxins that can cause food
     intoxication. The enterotoxins are proteins that are resistant to low pH, allowing them to pass through the stomach.
     They are heat stable and are not destroyed by boiling at 100 °C. Even though the bacterium itself may be killed, the
     enterotoxins alone can cause vomiting and diarrhea, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. At least
     some of the symptoms may be caused by the enterotoxin functioning as a superantigen and provoking a strong
     immune response by activating T cell proliferation.

     The rapid onset of signs and symptoms helps to diagnose this foodborne illness. Because the bacterium does not
     need to be present for the toxin to cause symptoms, diagnosis is confirmed by identifying the toxin in a food sample
     or in biological specimens (feces or vomitus) from the patient. Serological techniques, including ELISA, can also be
     used to identify the toxin in food samples.

     The condition generally resolves relatively quickly, within 24 hours, without treatment. In some cases, supportive
     treatment in a hospital may be needed.

Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery)

When gastrointestinal illness is associated with the rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium Shigella, it is called
bacillary dysentery, or shigellosis. Infections can be caused by S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and/or S.
sonnei that colonize the GI tract. Shigellosis can be spread from hand to mouth or through contaminated food and
water. Most commonly, it is transmitted through the fecal-oral route.

Shigella bacteria invade intestinal epithelial cells. When taken into a phagosome, they can escape and then live
within the cytoplasm of the cell or move to adjacent cells. As the organisms multiply, the epithelium and structures
with M cells of the Peyer's patches in the intestine may become ulcerated and cause loss of fluid. Stomach cramps,
fever, and watery diarrhea that may also contain pus, mucus, and/or blood often develop. More severe cases may
result in ulceration of the mucosa, dehydration, and rectal bleeding. Additionally, patients may later develop
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious condition in which damaged blood cells build up in the kidneys and
may cause kidney failure, or reactive arthritis, a condition in which arthritis develops in multiple joints following
infection. Patients may also develop chronic post-infection irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

S. dysenteriae type 1 is able to produce Shiga toxin, which targets the endothelial cells of small blood vessels in the
small and large intestine by binding to a glycosphingolipid. Once inside the endothelial cells, the toxin targets the
large ribosomal subunit, thus affecting protein synthesis of these cells. Hemorrhaging and lesions in the colon can
result. The toxin can target the kidney's glomerulus, the blood vessels where filtration of blood in the kidney begins,
thus resulting in HUS.

Stool samples, which should be processed promptly, are analyzed using serological or molecular techniques. One
common method is to perform immunoassays for S. dysenteriae. (Other methods that can be used to identify
Shigella include API test strips, Enterotube systems, or PCR testing. The presence of white blood cells and blood in
fecal samples occurs in about 70% of patients4 (Figure 24.17). Severe cases may require antibiotics such as
ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, but these must be carefully prescribed because resistance is increasingly common.

            FIGURE 24.17 Red and white blood cells can be seen in this micrograph of a stool sample from a patient with shigellosis.

     Salmonellosis

     Salmonella gastroenteritis, also called salmonellosis, is caused by the rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium
     Salmonella. Two species, S. enterica and S. bongori, cause disease in humans, but S. enterica is the most common.
     The most common serotypes of S. enterica are Enteritidis and Typhi. We will discuss typhoid fever caused by
     serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A separately. Here, we will focus on salmonellosis caused by other serotypes.

     Salmonella is a part of the normal intestinal microbiota of many individuals. However, salmonellosis is caused by
     exogenous agents, and infection can occur depending on the serotype, size of the inoculum, and overall health of
     the host. Infection is caused by ingestion of contaminated food, handling of eggshells, or exposure to certain
     animals. Salmonella is part of poultry's microbiota, so exposure to raw eggs and raw poultry can increase the risk of
     infection. Handwashing and cooking foods thoroughly greatly reduce the risk of transmission. Salmonella bacteria
     can survive freezing for extended periods but cannot survive high temperatures.

     Once the bacteria are ingested, they multiply within the intestines and penetrate the epithelial mucosal cells via M
     cells where they continue to grow (Figure 24.18). They trigger inflammatory processes and the hypersecretion of
     fluids. Once inside the body, they can persist inside the phagosomes of macrophages. Salmonella can cross the
     epithelial cell membrane and enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system. Some strains of Salmonella also
     produce an enterotoxin that can cause an intoxication.

     Infected individuals develop fever, nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea. These signs and
     symptoms generally last a few days to a week. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
     there are 1,000,000 cases annually, with 380 deaths each year.5 However, because the disease is usually self-
     limiting, many cases are not reported to doctors and the overall incidence may be underreported. Diagnosis involves
     culture followed by serotyping and DNA fingerprinting if needed. Positive results are reported to the CDC. When an
     unusual serotype is detected, samples are sent to the CDC for further analysis. Serotyping is important for
     determining treatment. Oral rehydration therapy is commonly used. Antibiotics are only recommended for serious
     cases. When antibiotics are needed, as in immunocompromised patients, fluoroquinolones, third-generation
     cephalosporins, and ampicillin are recommended. Antibiotic resistance is a serious concern.

Typhoid Fever

Certain serotypes of S. enterica, primarily serotype Typhi (S. typhi) but also Paratyphi, cause a more severe type of
salmonellosis called typhoid fever. This serious illness, which has an untreated mortality rate of 10%, causes high
fever, body aches, headache, nausea, lethargy, and a possible rash.

Some individuals carry S. typhi without presenting signs or symptoms (known as asymptomatic carriers) and
continually shed them through their feces. These carriers often have the bacteria in the gallbladder or intestinal
epithelium. Individuals consuming food or water contaminated with these feces can become infected.

S. typhi penetrate the intestinal mucosa, grow within the macrophages, and are transported through the body, most
notably to the liver and gallbladder. Eventually, the macrophages lyse, releasing S. typhi into the bloodstream and
lymphatic system. Mortality can result from ulceration and perforation of the intestine. A wide range of
complications, such as pneumonia and jaundice, can occur with disseminated disease.

S. typhi have Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) that contain the genes for many of their virulence factors. Two
examples of important typhoid toxins are the Vi antigen, which encodes for capsule production, and chimeric A2B5
toxin, which causes many of the signs and symptoms of the acute phase of typhoid fever.

Clinical examination and culture are used to make the diagnosis. The bacteria can be cultured from feces, urine,
blood, or bone marrow. Serology, including ELISA, is used to identify the most pathogenic strains, but confirmation
with DNA testing or culture is needed. A PCR test can also be used, but is not widely available.

The recommended antibiotic treatment involves fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Individuals must
be extremely careful to avoid infecting others during treatment. Typhoid fever can be prevented through vaccination
for individuals traveling to parts of the world where it is common.

EYE ON ETHICS

Typhoid Mary

Mary Mallon was an Irish immigrant who worked as a cook in New York in the early 20th century. Over seven
years, from 1900 to 1907, Mallon worked for a number of different households, unknowingly spreading illness to
the people who lived in each one. In 1906, one family hired George Soper, an expert in typhoid fever epidemics,
to determine the cause of the illnesses in their household. Eventually, Soper tracked Mallon down and directly
linked 22 cases of typhoid fever to her. He discovered that Mallon was a carrier for typhoid but was immune to it
herself. Although active carriers had been recognized before, this was the first time that an asymptomatic carrier
of infection had been identified.

Because she herself had never been ill, Mallon found it difficult to believe she could be the source of the illness.
She fled from Soper and the authorities because she did not want to be quarantined or forced to give up her
profession, which was relatively well paid for someone with her background. However, Mallon was eventually
caught and kept in an isolation facility in the Bronx, where she remained until 1910, when the New York health
department released her under the condition that she never again work with food. Unfortunately, Mallon did not
comply, and she soon began working as a cook again. After new cases began to appear that resulted in the death
of two individuals, the authorities tracked her down again and returned her to isolation, where she remained for
23 more years until her death in 1938. Epidemiologists were able to trace 51 cases of typhoid fever and three
deaths directly to Mallon, who is unflatteringly remembered as "Typhoid Mary."

     The Typhoid Mary case has direct correlations in the health-care industry. Consider Kaci Hickox, an American
     nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa during the 2014 epidemic. After returning to the United States,
     Hickox was quarantined against her will for three days and later found not to have Ebola. Hickox vehemently
     opposed the quarantine. In an editorial published in the British newspaper The Guardian,6 Hickox argued that
     quarantining asymptomatic health-care workers who had not tested positive for a disease would not only
     prevent such individuals from practicing their profession, but discourage others from volunteering to work in
     disease-ridden areas where health-care workers are desperately needed.

     What is the responsibility of an individual like Mary Mallon to change her behavior to protect others? What
     happens when an individual believes that she is not a risk, but others believe that she is? How would you react if
     you were in Mallon's shoes and were placed in a quarantine you did not believe was necessary, at the expense of
     your own freedom and possibly your career? Would it matter if you were definitely infected or not?

     E. coli Infections

     The gram-negative rod Escherichia coli is a common member of the normal microbiota of the colon. Although the
     vast majority of E. coli strains are helpful commensal bacteria, some can be pathogenic and may cause dangerous
     diarrheal disease. The pathogenic strains have additional virulence factors such as type 1 fimbriae that promote
     colonization of the colon or may produce toxins (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens). These
     virulence factors are acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

     Extraintestinal disease can result if the bacteria spread from the gastrointestinal tract. Although these bacteria can
     be spread from person to person, they are often acquired through contaminated food or water. There are six
     recognized pathogenic groups of E. coli, but we will focus here on the four that are most commonly transmitted
     through food and water.

     Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), also known as traveler's diarrhea, causes diarrheal illness and is common in less
     developed countries. In Mexico, ETEC infection is called Montezuma's Revenge. Following ingestion of contaminated
     food or water, infected individuals develop a watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, malaise (a feeling of being
     unwell), and a low fever. ETEC produces a heat-stable enterotoxin similar to cholera toxin, and adhesins called
     colonization factors that help the bacteria to attach to the intestinal wall. Some strains of ETEC also produce heat-
     labile toxins. The disease is usually relatively mild and self-limiting. Diagnosis involves culturing and PCR. If needed,
     antibiotic treatment with fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, rifaximin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ)
     may shorten infection duration. However, antibiotic resistance is a problem.

     Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) is very similar to shigellosis, including its pathogenesis of intracellular invasion into
     intestinal epithelial tissue. This bacterium carries a large plasmid that is involved in epithelial cell penetration. The
     illness is usually self-limiting, with symptoms including watery diarrhea, chills, cramps, malaise, fever, and
     dysentery. Culturing and PCR testing can be used for diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment is not recommended, so
     supportive therapy is used if needed.

     Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) can cause a potentially fatal diarrhea, especially in infants and those in less
     developed countries. Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration. These E. coli inject a protein (Tir)
     that attaches to the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells and triggers rearrangement of host cell actin from
     microvilli to pedestals. Tir also happens to be the receptor for Intimin, a surface protein produced by EPEC, thereby
     allowing E. coli to "sit" on the pedestal. The genes necessary for this pedestal formation are encoded on the locus
     for enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. As with ETEC, diagnosis involves culturing and PCR. Treatment
     is similar to that for ETEC.

     The most dangerous strains are enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which are the strains capable of causing
     epidemics. In particular, the strain O157:H7 has been responsible for several recent outbreaks. Recall that the O
     and H refer to surface antigens that contribute to pathogenicity and trigger a host immune response ("O" refers to
     the O-side chain of the lipopolysaccharide and the "H" refers to the flagella). Similar to EPEC, EHEC also forms

pedestals. EHEC also produces a Shiga-like toxin. Because the genome of this bacterium has been sequenced, it is
known that the Shiga toxin genes were most likely acquired through transduction (horizontal gene transfer). The
Shiga toxin genes originated from Shigella dysenteriae. Prophage from a bacteriophage that previously infected
Shigella integrated into the chromosome of E. coli. The Shiga-like toxin is often called verotoxin.

EHEC can cause disease ranging from relatively mild to life-threatening. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea with
severe cramping, but no fever. Although it is often self-limiting, it can lead to hemorrhagic colitis and profuse
bleeding. One possible complication is HUS. Diagnosis involves culture, often using MacConkey with sorbitol agar to
differentiate between E. coli O157:H7, which does not ferment sorbitol, and other less virulent strains of E. coli that
can ferment sorbitol.

Serological typing or PCR testing also can be used, as well as genetic testing for Shiga toxin. To distinguish EPEC
from EHEC, because they both form pedestals on intestinal epithelial cells, it is necessary to test for genes encoding
for both the Shiga-like toxin and for the LEE. Both EPEC and EHEC have LEE, but EPEC lacks the gene for Shiga toxin.
Antibiotic therapy is not recommended and may worsen HUS because of the toxins released when the bacteria are
killed, so supportive therapies must be used. Table 24.1 summarizes the characteristics of the four most common
pathogenic groups.

     · Compare and contrast the virulence factors and signs and symptoms of infections with the four main E. coli
        groups.

     Cholera and Other Vibrios

     The gastrointestinal disease cholera is a serious infection often associated with poor sanitation, especially following
     natural disasters, because it is spread through contaminated water and food that has not been heated to
     temperatures high enough to kill the bacteria. It is caused by Vibrio cholerae serotype O1, a gram-negative,
     flagellated bacterium in the shape of a curved rod (vibrio). According to the CDC, cholera causes an estimated 3 to 5
     million cases and 100,000 deaths each year.7

     Because V. cholerae is killed by stomach acid, relatively large doses are needed for a few microbial cells to survive
     to reach the intestines and cause infection. The motile cells travel through the mucous layer of the intestines, where
     they attach to epithelial cells and release cholera enterotoxin. The toxin is an A-B toxin with activity through
     adenylate cyclase (see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens). Within the intestinal cell, cyclic AMP
     (cAMP) levels increase, which activates a chloride channel and results in the release of ions into the intestinal
     lumen. This increase in osmotic pressure in the lumen leads to water also entering the lumen. As the water and
     electrolytes leave the body, it causes rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Diarrhea is so profuse that it is
     often called "rice water stool," and patients are placed on cots with a hole in them to monitor the fluid loss (Figure
     24.19).

     Cholera is diagnosed by taking a stool sample and culturing for Vibrio. The bacteria are oxidase positive and show
     non-lactose fermentation on MacConkey agar. Gram-negative lactose fermenters will produce red colonies while
     non-fermenters will produce white/colorless colonies. Gram-positive bacteria will not grow on MacConkey. Lactose
     fermentation is commonly used for pathogen identification because the normal microbiota generally ferments
     lactose while pathogens do not. V. cholerae may also be cultured on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose (TCBS)
     agar, a selective and differential media for Vibrio spp., which produce a distinct yellow colony.

Cholera may be self-limiting and treatment involves rehydration and electrolyte replenishment. Although antibiotics
are not typically needed, they can be used for severe or disseminated disease. Tetracyclines are recommended, but
doxycycline, erythromycin, orfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and TMP/SMZ may be used. Recent evidence suggests that
azithromycin is also a good first-line antibiotic. Good sanitation--including appropriate sewage treatment, clean
supplies for cooking, and purified drinking water--is important to prevent infection (Figure 24.19)

FIGURE 24.19 (a) Outbreaks of cholera often occur in areas with poor sanitation or after natural disasters that compromise sanitation
infrastructure. (b) At a cholera treatment center in Haiti, patients are receiving intravenous fluids to combat the dehydrating effects of this
disease. They often lie on a cot with a hole in it and a bucket underneath to allow for monitoring of fluid loss. (c) This scanning electron
micrograph shows Vibrio cholera. (credit a, b: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit c: modification of

V. cholera is not the only Vibrio species that can cause disease. V. parahemolyticus is associated with consumption
of contaminated seafood and causes gastrointestinal illness with signs and symptoms such as watery diarrhea,
nausea, fever, chills, and abdominal cramps. The bacteria produce a heat-stable hemolysin, leading to dysentery
and possible disseminated disease. It also sometimes causes wound infections. V. parahemolyticus is diagnosed
using cultures from blood, stool, or a wound. As with V. cholera, selective medium (especially TCBS agar) works
well. Tetracycline and ciprofloxacin can be used to treat severe cases, but antibiotics generally are not needed.

Vibrio vulnificus is found in warm seawater and, unlike V. cholerae, is not associated with poor sanitary conditions.
The bacteria can be found in raw seafood, and ingestion causes gastrointestinal illness. It can also be acquired by
individuals with open skin wounds who are exposed to water with high concentrations of the pathogen. In some
cases, the infection spreads to the bloodstream and causes septicemia. Skin infection can lead to edema,
ecchymosis (discoloration of skin due to bleeding), and abscesses. Patients with underlying disease have a high
fatality rate of about 50%. It is of particular concern for individuals with chronic liver disease or who are otherwise
immunodeficient because a healthy immune system can often prevent infection from developing. V. vulnificus is
diagnosed by culturing for the pathogen from stool samples, blood samples, or skin abscesses. Adult patients are
treated with doxycycline combined with a third generation cephalosporin or with fluoroquinolones, and children are
treated with TMP/SMZ.

Two other vibrios, Aeromonas hydrophila and Plesiomonas shigelloides, are also associated with marine
environments and raw seafood; they can also cause gastroenteritis. Like V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila is more often
associated with infections in wounds, generally those acquired in water. In some cases, it can also cause
septicemia. Other species of Aeromonas can cause illness. P. shigelloides is sometimes associated with more
serious systemic infections if ingested in contaminated food or water. Culture can be used to diagnose A. hydrophila
and P. shigelloides infections, for which antibiotic therapy is generally not needed. When necessary, tetracycline and
ciprofloxacin, among other antibiotics, may be used for treatment of A. hydrophila, and fluoroquinolones and
trimethoprim are the effective treatments for P. shigelloides.

Campylobacter jejuni Gastroenteritis

Campylobacter is a genus of gram-negative, spiral or curved bacteria. They may have one or two flagella.
972  24 · Digestive System Infections

     Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis, a form of campylobacteriosis, is a widespread illness that is caused by
     Campylobacter jejuni. The primary route of transmission is through poultry that becomes contaminated during
     slaughter. Handling of the raw chicken in turn contaminates cooking surfaces, utensils, and other foods.
     Unpasteurized milk or contaminated water are also potential vehicles of transmission. In most cases, the illness is
     self-limiting and includes fever, diarrhea, cramps, vomiting, and sometimes dysentery. More serious signs and
     symptoms, such as bacteremia, meningitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and hepatitis, sometimes occur. It has also
     been associated with autoimmune conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disease that occurs
     after some infections and results in temporary paralysis. HUS following infection can also occur. The virulence in
     many strains is the result of hemolysin production and the presence of Campylobacter cytolethal distending toxin
     (CDT), a powerful deoxyribonuclease (DNase) that irreversibly damages host cell DNA.

     Diagnosis involves culture under special conditions, such as elevated temperature, low oxygen tension, and often
     medium supplemented with antimicrobial agents. These bacteria should be cultured on selective medium (such as
     Campy CV, charcoal selective medium, or cefaperazone charcoal deoxycholate agar) and incubated under
     microaerophilic conditions for at least 72 hours at 42 °C. Antibiotic treatment is not usually needed, but
     erythromycin or ciprofloxacin may be used.

     Peptic Ulcers

     The gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is able to tolerate the acidic environment of the human stomach
     and has been shown to be a major cause of peptic ulcers, which are ulcers of the stomach or duodenum. The
     bacterium is also associated with increased risk of stomach cancer (Figure 24.20). According to the CDC,
     approximately two-thirds of the population is infected with H. pylori, but less than 20% have a risk of developing
     ulcers or stomach cancer. H. pylori is found in approximately 80% of stomach ulcers and in over 90% of duodenal
     ulcers.8

     H. pylori colonizes epithelial cells in the stomach using pili for adhesion. These bacteria produce urease, which
     stimulates an immune response and creates ammonia that neutralizes stomach acids to provide a more hospitable
     microenvironment. The infection damages the cells of the stomach lining, including those that normally produce the
     protective mucus that serves as a barrier between the tissue and stomach acid. As a result, inflammation (gastritis)
     occurs and ulcers may slowly develop. Ulcer formation can also be caused by toxin activity. It has been reported
     that 50% of clinical isolates of H. pylori have detectable levels of exotoxin activity in vitro.9 This toxin, VacA, induces
     vacuole formation in host cells. VacA has no primary sequence homology with other bacterial toxins, and in a mouse
     model, there is a correlation between the presence of the toxin gene, the activity of the toxin, and gastric epithelial
     tissue damage.

     Signs and symptoms include nausea, lack of appetite, bloating, burping, and weight loss. Bleeding ulcers may
     produce dark stools. If no treatment is provided, the ulcers can become deeper, more tissues can be involved, and
     stomach perforation can occur. Because perforation allows digestive enzymes and acid to leak into the body, it is a
     very serious condition.

To diagnose H. pylori infection, multiple methods are available. In a breath test, the patient swallows radiolabeled
urea. If H. pylori is present, the bacteria will produce urease to break down the urea. This reaction produces
radiolabeled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the patient's breath. Blood testing can also be used to detect
antibodies to H. pylori. The bacteria themselves can be detected using either a stool test or a stomach wall biopsy.

Antibiotics can be used to treat the infection. However, unique to H. pylori, the recommendation from the US Food
and Drug Administration is to use a triple therapy. The current protocols are 10 days of treatment with omeprazole,
amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (OAC); 14 days of treatment with bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and
tetracycline (BMT); or 10 or 14 days of treatment with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (LAC).
Omeprazole, bismuth subsalicylate, and lansoprazole are not antibiotics but are instead used to decrease acid levels
because H. pylori prefers acidic environments.

Although treatment is often valuable, there are also risks to H. pylori eradication. Infection with H. pylori may
actually protect against some cancers, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastroesophageal reflux
disease.10 11

     Clostridium perfringens Gastroenteritis

     Clostridium perfringens gastroenteritis is a generally mild foodborne disease that is associated with undercooked
     meats and other foods. C. perfringens is a gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming anaerobic bacterium that
     is tolerant of high and low temperatures. At high temperatures, the bacteria can form endospores that will
     germinate rapidly in foods or within the intestine. Food poisoning by type A strains is common. This strain always
     produces an enterotoxin, sometimes also present in other strains, that causes the clinical symptoms of cramps and
     diarrhea. A more severe form of the illness, called pig-bel or enteritis necroticans, causes hemorrhaging, pain,
     vomiting, and bloating. Gangrene of the intestines may result. This form has a high mortality rate but is rare in the
     United States.

     Diagnosis involves detecting the C. perfringens toxin in stool samples using either molecular biology techniques
     (PCR detection of the toxin gene) or immunology techniques (ELISA). The bacteria itself may also be detected in
     foods or in fecal samples. Treatment includes rehydration therapy, electrolyte replacement, and intravenous fluids.
     Antibiotics are not recommended because they can damage the balance of the microbiota in the gut, and there are
     concerns about antibiotic resistance. The illness can be prevented through proper handling and cooking of foods,
     including prompt refrigeration at sufficiently low temperatures and cooking food to a sufficiently high temperature.

     Clostridium difficile

     Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive rod that can be a commensal bacterium as part of the normal microbiota of
     healthy individuals. When the normal microbiota is disrupted by long-term antibiotic use, it can allow the
     overgrowth of this bacterium, resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by C. difficile. Antibiotic-
     associated diarrhea can also be considered a nosocomial disease. Patients at the greatest risk of C. difficile infection
     are those who are immunocompromised, have been in health-care settings for extended periods, are older, have
     recently taken antibiotics, have had gastrointestinal procedures done, or use proton pump inhibitors, which reduce
     stomach acidity and allow proliferation of C. difficile. Because this species can form endospores, it can survive for
     extended periods of time in the environment under harsh conditions and is a considerable concern in health-care
     settings.

     This bacterium produces two toxins, Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB).
     These toxins inactivate small GTP-binding proteins, resulting in actin condensation and cell rounding, followed by
     cell death. Infections begin with focal necrosis, then ulceration with exudate, and can progress to
     pseudomembranous colitis, which involves inflammation of the colon and the development of a pseudomembrane
     of fibrin containing dead epithelial cells and leukocytes (Figure 24.21). Watery diarrhea, dehydration, fever, loss of
     appetite, and abdominal pain can result. Perforation of the colon can occur, leading to septicemia, shock, and death.
     C. difficile is also associated with necrotizing enterocolitis in premature babies and neutropenic enterocolitis
     associated with cancer therapies.

FIGURE 24.21 Clostridium difficile is able to colonize the mucous membrane of the colon when the normal microbiota is disrupted. The

Over time, inflammation and dead cells contribute to the development of a pseudomembrane. (credit micrograph: modification of work by
Janice Carr, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Diagnosis is made by considering the patient history (such as exposure to antibiotics), clinical presentation, imaging,
endoscopy, lab tests, and other available data. Detecting the toxin in stool samples is used to confirm diagnosis.
Although culture is preferred, it is rarely practical in clinical practice because the bacterium is an obligate anaerobe.
Nucleic acid amplification tests, including PCR, are considered preferable to ELISA testing for molecular analysis.

The first step of conventional treatment is to stop antibiotic use, and then to provide supportive therapy with
electrolyte replacement and fluids. Metronidazole is the preferred treatment if the C. difficile diagnosis has been
confirmed. Vancomycin can also be used, but it should be reserved for patients for whom metronidazole was
ineffective or who meet other criteria (e.g., under 10 years of age, pregnant, or allergic to metronidazole).

A newer approach to treatment, known as a fecal transplant, focuses on restoring the microbiota of the gut in order
to combat the infection. In this procedure, a healthy individual donates a stool sample, which is mixed with saline
and transplanted to the recipient via colonoscopy, endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or enema. It has been reported that
this procedure has greater than 90% success in resolving C. difficile infections.12

     Foodborne Illness Due to Bacillus cereus

     Bacillus cereus, commonly found in soil, is a gram-positive endospore-forming bacterium that can sometimes cause
     foodborne illness. B. cereus endospores can survive cooking and produce enterotoxins in food after it has been
     heated; illnesses often occur after eating rice and other prepared foods left at room temperature for too long. The
     signs and symptoms appear within a few hours of ingestion and include nausea, pain, and abdominal cramps. B.
     cereus produces two toxins: one causing diarrhea, and the other causing vomiting. More severe signs and symptoms
     can sometimes develop.

     Diagnosis can be accomplished by isolating bacteria from stool samples or vomitus and uneaten infected food.
     Treatment involves rehydration and supportive therapy. Antibiotics are not typically needed, as the illness is usually
     relatively mild and is due to toxin activity.

     Foodborne Illness Due to Yersinia

     The genus Yersinia is best known for Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative rod that causes the plague. However, Y.
     enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis can cause gastroenteritis. The infection is generally transmitted through
     the fecal-oral route, with ingestion of food or water that has been contaminated by feces. Intoxication can also
     result because of the activity of its endotoxin and exotoxins (enterotoxin and cytotoxin necrotizing factor). The
     illness is normally relatively mild and self-limiting. However, severe diarrhea and dysentery can develop in infants.
     In adults, the infection can spread and cause complications such as reactive arthritis, thyroid disorders,
     endocarditis, glomerulonephritis, eye inflammation, and/or erythema nodosum. Bacteremia may develop in rare
     cases.

     Diagnosis is generally made by detecting the bacteria in stool samples. Samples may also be obtained from other
     tissues or body fluids. Treatment is usually supportive, including rehydration, without antibiotics. If bacteremia or
     other systemic disease is present, then antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, doxycycline, and
     trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used. Recovery can take up to two weeks.

     contaminated food or water. Toxins and other virulence factors can produce gastrointestinal inflammation and
     general symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. Bacterial GI infections can vary widely in terms of severity and

gastroenteritis is viral.14 As discussed, there are a number of bacteria responsible for diarrhea, but viruses can also
cause diarrhea. E. coli and rotavirus are the most common causative agents in the developing world. In this section,
we will discuss rotaviruses and other, less common viruses that can also cause gastrointestinal illnesses.

Gastroenteritis Caused by Rotaviruses

Rotaviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae. They are responsible for common diarrheal
illness, although prevention through vaccination is becoming more common. The virus is primarily spread by the
fecal-oral route (Figure 24.24).

     These viruses are widespread in children, especially in day-care centers. The CDC estimates that 95% of children in
     the United States have had at least one rotavirus infection by the time they reach age five.15 Due to the memory of
     the body's immune system, adults who come into contact with rotavirus will not contract the infection or, if they do,
     are asymptomatic. The elderly, however, are vulnerable to rotavirus infection due to weakening of the immune
     system with age, so infections can spread through nursing homes and similar facilities. In these cases, the infection
     may be transmitted from a family member who may have subclinical or clinical disease. The virus can also be
     transmitted from contaminated surfaces, on which it can survive for some time.

     Infected individuals exhibit fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The virus can survive in the stomach following a meal, but
     is normally found in the small intestines, particularly the epithelial cells on the villi. Infection can cause food
     intolerance, especially with respect to lactose. The illness generally appears after an incubation period of about two
     days and lasts for approximately one week (three to eight days). Without supportive treatment, the illness can cause
     severe fluid loss, dehydration, and even death. Even with milder illness, repeated infections can potentially lead to
     malnutrition, especially in developing countries, where rotavirus infection is common due to poor sanitation and lack
     of access to clean drinking water. Patients (especially children) who are malnourished after an episode of diarrhea
     are more susceptible to future diarrheal illness, increasing their risk of death from rotavirus infection.

     The most common clinical tool for diagnosis is enzyme immunoassay, which detects the virus from fecal samples.
     Latex agglutination assays are also used. Additionally, the virus can be detected using electron microscopy and RT-
     PCR.

     Treatment is supportive with oral rehydration therapy. Preventive vaccination is also available. In the United States,
     rotavirus vaccines are part of the standard vaccine schedule and administration follows the guidelines of the World
     Health Organization (WHO). The WHO recommends that all infants worldwide receive the rotavirus vaccine, the first
     dose between six and 15 weeks of age and the second before 32 weeks.16

     Gastroenteritis Caused by Noroviruses

     Noroviruses, commonly identified as Norwalk viruses, are caliciviruses. Several strains can cause gastroenteritis.
     There are millions of cases a year, predominately in infants, young children, and the elderly. These viruses are easily
     transmitted and highly contagious. They are known for causing widespread infections in groups of people in
     confined spaces, such as on cruise ships. The viruses can be transmitted through direct contact, through touching
     contaminated surfaces, and through contaminated food. Because the virus is not killed by disinfectants used at
     standard concentrations for killing bacteria, the risk of transmission remains high, even after cleaning.

     The signs and symptoms of norovirus infection are similar to those for rotavirus, with watery diarrhea, mild cramps,
     and fever. Additionally, these viruses sometimes cause projectile vomiting. The illness is usually relatively mild,
     develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure, and clears within a couple of days without treatment. However, dehydration
     may occur.

     Norovirus can be detected using PCR or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing. RT-qPCR is the preferred approach as
     EIA is insufficiently sensitive. If EIA is used for rapid testing, diagnosis should be confirmed using PCR. No
     medications are available, but the illness is usually self-limiting. Rehydration therapy and electrolyte replacement
     may be used. Good hygiene, hand washing, and careful food preparation reduce the risk of infection.

     Gastroenteritis Caused by Astroviruses

     Astroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses (family Astroviridae) that can cause severe gastroenteritis, especially
     in infants and children. Signs and symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, headache,
     and malaise. The viruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route (contaminated food or water). For diagnosis,
     stool samples are analyzed. Testing may involve enzyme immunoassays and immune electron microscopy.
     Treatment involves supportive rehydration and electrolyte replacement if needed.

Viral Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract

A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, characterized by inflammation of the GI tract and other signs and
symptoms with a range of severities. As with bacterial GI infections, some cases can be relatively mild and self-
limiting, while others can become serious and require intensive treatment. Antimicrobial drugs are generally not
used to treat viral gastroenteritis; generally, these illnesses can be treated effectively with rehydration therapy
to replace fluids lost in bouts of diarrhea and vomiting. Because most viral causes of gastroenteritis are quite
contagious, the best preventive measures involve avoiding and/or isolating infected individuals and limiting
transmission through good hygiene and sanitation.

                                                                                    FIGURE 24.25

Hepatitis

Hepatitis is a general term meaning inflammation of the liver, which can have a variety of causes. In some cases, the
cause is viral infection. There are five main hepatitis viruses that are clinically significant: hepatitisviruses A (HAV), B
(HBV), C (HCV), D, (HDV) and E (HEV) (Figure 24.26). Note that other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
yellow fever, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) can also cause hepatitis and are discussed in Viral Infections of the
Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems.

FIGURE 24.26 Five main types of viruses cause hepatitis. HAV is a non-enveloped ssRNA(+) virus and is a member of the picornavirus
982  24 · Digestive System Infections

     family (Baltimore Group IV). HBV is a dsDNA enveloped virus, replicates using reverse transcriptase, and is a member of the hepadnavirus
     family (Baltimore Group VII). HCV is an enveloped ssRNA(+) virus and is a member of the flavivirus family (Baltimore Group IV). HDV is an
     enveloped ssRNA(-) that is circular (Baltimore Group V). This virus can only propagate in the presence of HBV. HEV is a non-enveloped
     ssRNA(+) virus and a member of the hepeviridae family (Baltimore Group IV).

     Although the five hepatitis viruses differ, they can cause some similar signs and symptoms because they all have an
     affinity for hepatocytes (liver cells). HAV and HEV can be contracted through ingestion while HBV, HCV, and HDV are
     transmitted by parenteral contact. It is possible for individuals to become long term or chronic carriers of hepatitis
     viruses.

     The virus enters the blood (viremia), spreading to the spleen, the kidneys, and the liver. During viral replication, the
     virus infects hepatocytes. The inflammation is caused by the hepatocytes replicating and releasing more hepatitis
     virus. Signs and symptoms include malaise, anorexia, loss of appetite, dark urine, pain in the upper right quadrant of
     the abdomen, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, joint pain, and gray stool. Additionally, when the liver is diseased or
     injured, it is unable to break down hemoglobin effectively, and bilirubin can build up in the body, giving the skin and
     mucous membranes a yellowish color, a condition called jaundice (Figure 24.27). In severe cases, death from liver
     necrosis may occur.

     FIGURE 24.27 (a) Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver resulting from a variety of root causes. It can cause jaundice. (b) Jaundice is
     characterized by yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and sclera of the eyes. (credit b left: modification of work by James Heilman,
     MD; credit b right: modification of work by "Sab3el3eish"/Wikimedia Commons)

     Despite having many similarities, each of the hepatitis viruses has its own unique characteristics. HAV is generally
     transmitted through the fecal-oral route, close personal contact, or exposure to contaminated water or food.
     Hepatitis A can develop after an incubation period of 15 to 50 days (the mean is 30). It is normally mild or even
     asymptomatic and is usually self-limiting within weeks to months. A more severe form, fulminant hepatitis, rarely
     occurs but has a high fatality rate of 70-80%. Vaccination is available and is recommended especially for children
     (between ages one and two), those traveling to countries with higher risk, those with liver disease and certain other
     conditions, and drug users.

Although HBV is associated with similar signs and symptoms, transmission and outcomes differ. This virus has a
mean incubation period of 120 days and is generally associated with exposure to infectious blood or body fluids
such as semen or saliva. Exposure can occur through skin puncture, across the placenta, or through mucosal
contact, but it is not spread through casual contact such as hugging, hand holding, sneezing, or coughing, or even
through breastfeeding or kissing. Risk of infection is greatest for those who use intravenous drugs or who have
sexual contact with an infected individual. Health-care workers are also at risk from needle sticks and other injuries
when treating infected patients. The infection can become chronic and may progress to cirrhosis or liver failure. It is
also associated with liver cancer. Chronic infections are associated with the highest mortality rates and are more
common in infants. Approximately 90% of infected infants become chronic carriers, compared with only 6-10% of
infected adults.17 Vaccination is available and is recommended for children as part of the standard vaccination
schedule (one dose at birth and the second by 18 months of age) and for adults at greater risk (e.g., those with
certain diseases, intravenous drug users, and those who have sex with multiple partners). Health-care agencies are
required to offer the HBV vaccine to all workers who have occupational exposure to blood and/or other infectious
materials.

HCV is often undiagnosed and therefore may be more widespread than is documented. It has a mean incubation
period of 45 days and is transmitted through contact with infected blood. Although some cases are asymptomatic
and/or resolve spontaneously, 75%-85% of infected individuals become chronic carriers. Nearly all cases result
from parenteral transmission often associated with IV drug use or transfusions. The risk is greatest for individuals
with past or current history of intravenous drug use or who have had sexual contact with infected individuals. It has
also been spread through contaminated blood products and can even be transmitted through contaminated
personal products such as toothbrushes and razors. New medications have recently been developed that show
great effectiveness in treating HCV and that are tailored to the specific genotype causing the infection.

HDV is uncommon in the United States and only occurs in individuals who are already infected with HBV, which it
requires for replication. Therefore, vaccination against HBV is also protective against HDV infection. HDV is
transmitted through contact with infected blood.

HEV infections are also rare in the United States but many individuals have a positive antibody titer for HEV. The
virus is most commonly spread by the fecal-oral route through food and/or water contamination, or person-to-
person contact, depending on the genotype of the virus, which varies by location. There are four genotypes that
differ somewhat in their mode of transmission, distribution, and other factors (for example, two are zoonotic and
two are not, and only one causes chronic infection). Genotypes three and four are only transmitted through food,
while genotypes one and two are also transmitted through water and fecal-oral routes. Genotype one is the only
type transmitted person-to-person and is the most common cause of HEV outbreaks. Consumption of undercooked
meat, especially deer or pork, and shellfish can lead to infection. Genotypes three and four are zoonoses, so they
can be transmitted from infected animals that are consumed. Pregnant people are at particular risk. This disease is
usually self-limiting within two weeks and does not appear to cause chronic infection.

General laboratory testing for hepatitis begins with blood testing to examine liver function (Figure 24.28). When the
liver is not functioning normally, the blood will contain elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, serum albumin, serum
total protein, and calculated globulin, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio. Some of these are included in a complete
metabolic panel (CMP), which may first suggest a possible liver problem and indicate the need for more
comprehensive testing. A hepatitis virus serological test panel can be used to detect antibodies for hepatitis viruses
A, B, C, and sometimes D. Additionally, other immunological and genomic tests are available.

Specific treatments other than supportive therapy, rest, and fluids are often not available for hepatitis virus
infection, except for HCV, which is often self-limited. Immunoglobulins can be used prophylactically following
possible exposure. Medications are also used, including interferon alpha 2b and antivirals (e.g., lamivudine,
entecavir, adefovir, and telbivudine) for chronic infections. Hepatitis C can be treated with interferon (as
monotherapy or combined with other treatments), protease inhibitors, and other antivirals (e.g., the polymerase
inhibitor sofosbuvir). Combination treatments are commonly used. Antiviral and immunosuppressive medications
may be used for chronic cases of HEV. In severe cases, liver transplants may be necessary. Additionally, vaccines

     Preventing HBV Transmission in Health-Care Settings

     Hepatitis B was once a leading on-the-job hazard for health-care workers. Many health-care workers over the years
     have become infected, some developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. In 1982, the CDC recommended that health-care
     workers be vaccinated against HBV, and rates of infection have declined since then. Even though vaccination is now
     common, it is not always effective and not all individuals are vaccinated. Therefore, there is still a small risk for
     infection, especially for health-care workers working with individuals who have chronic infections, such as drug
     addicts, and for those with higher risk of needle sticks, such as phlebotomists. Dentists are also at risk.

     Health-care workers need to take appropriate precautions to prevent infection by HBV and other illnesses. Blood is
     the greatest risk, but other body fluids can also transmit infection. Damaged skin, as occurs with eczema or
     psoriasis, can also allow transmission. Avoiding contact with body fluids, especially blood, by wearing gloves and
     face protection and using disposable syringes and needles reduce the risk of infection. Washing exposed skin with
     soap and water is recommended. Antiseptics may also be used, but may not help. Post-exposure treatment,
     including treatment with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and vaccination, may be used in the event of exposure
     to the virus from an infected patient. Detailed protocols are available for managing these situations. The virus can
     remain infective for up to seven days when on surfaces, even if no blood or other fluids are visible, so it is important
     to consider the best choices for disinfecting and sterilizing equipment that could potentially transmit the virus. The
     CDC recommends a solution of 10% bleach to disinfect surfaces.18 Finally, testing blood products is important to
     reduce the risk of transmission during transfusions and similar procedures.

24.5 Protozoan Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common protozoans that can cause infections of the GI tract
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific protozoan diseases affecting the GI tract
Like other microbes, protozoa are abundant in natural microbiota but can also be associated with significant illness.
986  24 · Digestive System Infections

     Gastrointestinal diseases caused by protozoa are generally associated with exposure to contaminated food and
     water, meaning that those without access to good sanitation are at greatest risk. Even in developed countries,
     infections can occur and these microbes have sometimes caused significant outbreaks from contamination of public
     water supplies.

     Giardiasis

     Also called backpacker's diarrhea or beaver fever, giardiasis is a common disease in the United States caused by
     the flagellated protist Giardia lamblia, also known as Giardia intestinalis or Giardia duodenalis (Figure 1.16). To
     establish infection, G. lamblia uses a large adhesive disk to attach to the intestinal mucosa. The disk is comprised of
     microtubules. During adhesion, the flagella of G. lamblia move in a manner that draws fluid out from under the disk,
     resulting in an area of lower pressure that promotes its adhesion to the intestinal epithelial cells. Due to its
     attachment, Giardia also blocks absorption of nutrients, including fats.

     Transmission occurs through contaminated food or water or directly from person to person. Children in day-care
     centers are at risk due to their tendency to put items into their mouths that may be contaminated. Large outbreaks
     may occur if a public water supply becomes contaminated. Giardia have a resistant cyst stage in their life cycle that
     is able to survive cold temperatures and the chlorination treatment typically used for drinking water in municipal
     reservoirs. As a result, municipal water must be filtered to trap and remove these cysts. Once consumed by the host,
     Giardia develops into the active tropozoite.

     Infected individuals may be asymptomatic or have gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, sometimes accompanied
     by weight loss. Common symptoms, which appear one to three weeks after exposure, include diarrhea, nausea,
     stomach cramps, gas, greasy stool (because fat absorption is being blocked), and possible dehydration. The parasite
     remains in the colon and does not cause systemic infection. Signs and symptoms generally clear within two to six
     weeks. Chronic infections may develop and are often resistant to treatment. These are associated with weight loss,
     episodic diarrhea, and malabsorption syndrome due to the blocked nutrient absorption.

     Diagnosis may be made using observation under the microscope. A stool ova and parasite (O&P) exam involves
     direct examination of a stool sample for the presence of cysts and trophozoites; it can be used to distinguish
     common parasitic intestinal infections. ELISA and other immunoassay tests, including commercial direct
     fluorescence antibody kits, are also used. The most common treatments use metronidazole as the first-line choice,
     followed by tinidazole. If the infection becomes chronic, the parasites may become resistant to medications.

     Cryptosporidiosis

     Another protozoan intestinal illness is cryptosporidiosis, which is usually caused by Cryptosporidium parvum or C.
     hominis. (Figure 24.29) These pathogens are commonly found in animals and can be spread in feces from mice,
     birds, and farm animals. Contaminated water and food are most commonly responsible for transmission. The
     protozoan can also be transmitted through human contact with infected animals or their feces.

     In the United States, outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis generally occur through contamination of the public water
     supply or contaminated water at water parks, swimming pools, and day-care centers. The risk is greatest in areas
     with poor sanitation, making the disease more common in developing countries.

     Signs and symptoms include watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, cramps, fever, dehydration, and weight loss. The
     illness is generally self-limiting within a month. However, immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/
     AIDS, are at particular risk of severe illness or death.

     Diagnosis involves direct examination of stool samples, often over multiple days. As with giardiasis, a stool O&P
     exam may be helpful. Acid fast staining is often used. Enzyme immunoassays and molecular analysis (PCR) are
     available.

     The first line of treatment is typically oral rehydration therapy. Medications are sometimes used to treat the
     diarrhea. The broad-range anti-parasitic drug nitazoxanide can be used to treat cryptosporidiosis. Other anti-
     parasitic drugs that can be used include azithromycin and paromomycin.

Amoebiasis (Amebiasis)

The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis, which is known as amoebic dysentery in severe
cases. E. histolytica is generally transmitted through water or food that has fecal contamination. The disease is most
widespread in the developing world and is one of the leading causes of mortality from parasitic disease worldwide.
Disease can be caused by as few as 10 cysts being transmitted.

Signs and symptoms range from nonexistent to mild diarrhea to severe amoebic dysentery. Severe infection causes
the abdomen to become distended and may be associated with fever. The parasite may live in the colon without
causing signs or symptoms or may invade the mucosa to cause colitis. In some cases, the disease spreads to the
spleen, brain, genitourinary tract, or lungs. In particular, it may spread to the liver and cause an abscess. When a
liver abscess develops, fever, nausea, liver tenderness, weight loss, and pain in the right abdominal quadrant may
occur. Chronic infection may occur and is associated with intermittent diarrhea, mucus, pain, flatulence, and weight
loss.

Direct examination of fecal specimens may be used for diagnosis. As with cryptosporidiosis, samples are often
examined on multiple days. A stool O&P exam of fecal or biopsy specimens may be helpful. Immunoassay, serology,
biopsy, molecular, and antibody detection tests are available. Enzyme immunoassay may not distinguish current
from past illness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect any liver abscesses. The first line of
treatment is metronidazole or tinidazole, followed by diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, or paromomycin to eliminate
the cysts that remain.

Cyclosporiasis

The intestinal disease cyclosporiasis is caused by the protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis. It is endemic to tropical
and subtropical regions and therefore uncommon in the United States, although there have been outbreaks
associated with contaminated produce imported from regions where the protozoan is more common.

This protist is transmitted through contaminated food and water and reaches the lining of the small intestine, where
it causes infection. Signs and symptoms begin within seven to ten days after ingestion. Based on limited data, it
appears to be seasonal in ways that differ regionally and that are poorly understood.19

Some individuals do not develop signs or symptoms. Those who do may exhibit explosive and watery diarrhea, fever,
nausea, vomiting, cramps, loss of appetite, fatigue, and bloating. These symptoms may last for months without
treatment. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the recommended treatment.

Microscopic examination is used for diagnosis. A stool O&P examination may be helpful. The oocysts have a

24.6 Helminthic Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common helminths that cause infections of the GI tract
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific helminthic diseases affecting GI tract

Helminths are widespread intestinal parasites. These parasites can be divided into three common groups: round-
bodied worms also described as nematodes, flat-bodied worms that are segmented (also described as cestodes),
and flat-bodied worms that are non-segmented (also described as trematodes). The nematodes include
roundworms, pinworms, hookworms, and whipworms. Cestodes include beef, pork, and fish tapeworms.
Trematodes are collectively called flukes and more uniquely identified with the body site where the adult flukes are
located. Although infection can have serious consequences, many of these parasites are so well adapted to the
human host that there is little obvious disease.

Ascariasis

Infections caused by the large nematode roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, a soil-transmitted helminth, are called
ascariasis. Over 800 million to 1 billion people are estimated to be infected worldwide.20 Infections are most
common in warmer climates and at warmer times of year. At present, infections are uncommon in the United States.
The eggs of the worms are transmitted through contaminated food and water. This may happen if food is grown in
contaminated soil, including when manure is used as fertilizer.
990  24 · Digestive System Infections

     When an individual consumes embryonated eggs (those with a developing embryo), the eggs travel to the intestine
     and the larvae are able to hatch. Ascaris is able to produce proteases that allow for penetration and degradation of
     host tissue. The juvenile worms can then enter the circulatory system and migrate to the lungs where they enter the
     alveoli (air sacs). From here they crawl to the pharynx and then follow the gut lumen to return to the small intestine,
     where they mature into adult roundworms. Females in the host will produce and release eggs that leave the host via
     feces. In some cases, the worms can block ducts such as those of the pancreas or gallbladder.

     The infection is commonly asymptomatic. When signs and symptoms are present, they include shortness of breath,
     cough, nausea, diarrhea, blood in the stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. The roundworms may be
     visible in the stool. In severe cases, children with substantial infections may experience intestinal blockage.

     The eggs can be identified by microscopic examination of the stool (Figure 24.32). In some cases, the worms
     themselves may be identified if coughed up or excreted in stool. They can also sometimes be identified by X-rays,
     ultrasounds, or MRIs.

     Ascariasis is self-limiting, but can last one to two years because the worms can inhibit the body's inflammatory
     response through glycan gimmickry (see Virulence Factors of Eukaryotic Pathogens). The first line of treatment is
     mebendazole or albendazole. In some severe cases, surgery may be required.

     Hookworm

     Two species of nematode worms are associated with hookworm infection. Both species are found in the Americas,
     Africa, and Asia. Necator americanus is found predominantly in the United States and Australia. Another species,
     Ancylostoma doudenale, is found in southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

     The eggs of these species develop into larvae in soil contaminated by dog or cat feces. These larvae can penetrate
     the skin. After traveling through the venous circulation, they reach the lungs. When they are coughed up, they are
     then swallowed and can enter the intestine and develop into mature adults. At this stage, they attach to the wall of
     the intestine, where they feed on blood and can potentially cause anemia. Signs and symptoms include cough, an
     itchy rash, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In children, hookworms can affect physical and cognitive
     growth.

     Some hookworm species, such as Ancylostoma braziliense that is commonly found in animals such as cats and
     dogs, can penetrate human skin and migrate, causing cutaneous larva migrans, a skin disease caused by the larvae
     of hookworms. As they move across the skin, in the subcutaneous tissue, pruritic tracks appear (Figure 24.33).

The infection is diagnosed using microscopic examination of the stool, allowing for observation of eggs in the feces.
Medications such as albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are used as needed to treat systemic
infection. In addition to systemic medication for symptoms associated with cutaneous larva migrans, topical
thiabendazole is applied to the affected areas.

Strongyloidiasis

Strongyloidiasis is generally caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted helminth with both free-living
and parasitic forms. In the parasitic form, the larvae of these nematodes generally penetrate the body through the
skin, especially through bare feet, although transmission through organ transplantation or at facilities like day-care
centers can also occur. When excreted in the stool, larvae can become free-living adults rather than developing into
the parasitic form. These free-living worms reproduce, laying eggs that hatch into larvae that can develop into the
parasitic form. In the parasitic life cycle, infective larvae enter the skin, generally through the feet. The larvae reach
the circulatory system, which allows them to travel to the alveolar spaces of the lungs. They are transported to the
pharynx where, like many other helminths, the infected patient coughs them up and swallows them again so that
they return to the intestine. Once they reach the intestine, females live in the epithelium and produce eggs that
develop asexually, unlike the free-living forms, which use sexual reproduction. The larvae may be excreted in the
stool or can reinfect the host by entering the tissue of the intestines and skin around the anus, which can lead to
chronic infections.

The condition is generally asymptomatic, although severe symptoms can develop after treatment with
corticosteroids for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or following other forms of
immunosuppression. When the immune system is suppressed, the rate of autoinfection increases, and huge
amounts of larvae migrate to organs throughout the body.

Signs and symptoms are generally nonspecific. The condition can cause a rash at the site of skin entry, cough (dry or
with blood), fever, nausea, difficulty breathing, bloating, pain, heartburn, and, rarely, arthritis, or cardiac or kidney
complications. Disseminated strongyloidiasis or hyperinfection is a life-threatening form of the disease that can
occur, usually following immunosuppression such as that caused by glucocorticoid treatment (most commonly),
with other immunosuppressive medications, with HIV infection, or with malnutrition.

As with other helminths, direct examination of the stool is important in diagnosis. Ideally, this should be continued
over seven days. Serological testing, including antigen testing, is also available. These can be limited by cross-
reactions with other similar parasites and by the inability to distinguish current from resolved infection. Ivermectin
is the preferred treatment, with albendazole as a secondary option.

     Pinworms (Enterobiasis)

     Enterobius vermicularis, commonly called pinworms, are tiny (2-13 mm) nematodes that cause enterobiasis. Of all
     helminthic infections, enterobiasis is the most common in the United States, affecting as many as one-third of
     American children.21 Although the signs and symptoms are generally mild, patients may experience abdominal pain
     and insomnia from itching of the perianal region, which frequently occurs at night when worms leave the anus to lay
     eggs. The itching contributes to transmission, as the disease is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. When an
     infected individual scratches the anal area, eggs may get under the fingernails and later be deposited near the
     individual's mouth, causing reinfection, or on fomites, where they can be transferred to new hosts. After being
     ingested, the larvae hatch within the small intestine and then take up residence in the colon and develop into adults.
     From the colon, the female adult exits the body at night to lay eggs (Figure 24.34).

     Infection is diagnosed in any of three ways. First, because the worms emerge at night to lay eggs, it is possible to
     inspect the perianal region for worms while an individual is asleep. An alternative is to use transparent tape to
     remove eggs from the area around the anus first thing in the morning for three days to yield eggs for microscopic
     examination. Finally, it may be possible to detect eggs through examination of samples from under the fingernails,
     where eggs may lodge due to scratching. Once diagnosis has been made, mebendazole, albendazole, and pyrantel
     pamoate are effective for treatment.

               FIGURE 24.34 (a) E. vermicularis are tiny nematodes commonly called pinworms. (b) This micrograph shows pinworm eggs.

     Trichuriasis

     The nematode whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a parasite that is transmitted by ingestion from soil-contaminated
     hands or food and causes trichuriasis. Infection is most common in warm environments, especially when there is
     poor sanitation and greater risk of fecal contamination of soil, or when food is grown in soil using manure as a
     fertilizer. The signs and symptoms may be minimal or nonexistent. When a substantial infection develops, signs and
     symptoms include painful, frequent diarrhea that may contain mucus and blood. It is possible for the infection to
     cause rectal prolapse, a condition in which a portion of the rectum becomes detached from the inside of the body
     and protrudes from the anus (Figure 24.35). Severely infected children may experience reduced growth and their
     cognitive development may be affected.
     When fertilized eggs are ingested, they travel to the intestine and the larvae emerge, taking up residence in the walls
     of the colon and cecum. They attach themselves with part of their bodies embedded in the mucosa. The larvae
     mature and live in the cecum and ascending colon. After 60 to 70 days, females begin to lay 3000 to 20,000 eggs
     per day.
     Diagnosis involves examination of the feces for the presence of eggs. It may be necessary to use concentration
     techniques and to collect specimens on multiple days. Following diagnosis, the infection may be treated with
     mebendazole, albendazole, or ivermectin.

Trichinosis

Trichinosis (trichenellosis) develops following consumption of food that contains Trichinella spiralis (most
commonly) or other Trichinella species. These microscopic nematode worms are most commonly transmitted in
meat, especially pork, that has not been cooked thoroughly. T. spiralis larvae in meat emerge from cysts when
exposed to acid and pepsin in the stomach. They develop into mature adults within the large intestine. The larvae
produced in the large intestine are able to migrate into the muscles mechanically via the stylet of the parasite,
forming cysts. Muscle proteins are reduced in abundance or undetectable in cells that contain Trichinella (nurse
cells). Animals that ingest the cysts from other animals can later develop infection (Figure 24.36).

Although infection may be asymptomatic, symptomatic infections begin within a day or two of consuming the
nematodes. Abdominal symptoms arise first and can include diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Other
possible symptoms include headache, light sensitivity, muscle pain, fever, cough, chills, and conjunctivitis. More
severe symptoms affecting motor coordination, breathing, and the heart sometimes occur. It may take months for
the symptoms to resolve, and the condition is occasionally fatal. Mild cases may be mistaken for influenza or similar
conditions.

Infection is diagnosed using clinical history, muscle biopsy to look for larvae, and serological testing, including
immunoassays. Enzyme immunoassay is the most common test. It is difficult to effectively treat larvae that have
formed cysts in the muscle, although medications may help. It is best to begin treatment as soon as possible
because medications such as mebendazole and albendazole are effective in killing only the adult worms in the
intestine. Steroids may be used to reduce inflammation if larvae are in the muscles.

     Tapeworms (Taeniasis)

     Taeniasis is a tapeworm infection, generally caused by pork (Taenia solium), beef (Taenia saginata), and Asian
     (Taenia asiatica) tapeworms found in undercooked meat. Consumption of raw or undercooked fish, including
     contaminated sushi, can also result in infection from the fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum). Tapeworms are
     flatworms (cestodes) with multiple body segments and a head called a scolex that attaches to the intestinal wall.
     Tapeworms can become quite large, reaching 4 to 8 meters long (Figure 24.37). Figure 5.23 illustrates the life cycle
     of a tapeworm.

     FIGURE 24.37 (a) An adult tapeworm uses the scolex to attach to the intestinal wall. (b) The egg of a pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) is
     visible in this micrograph. (credit a, b: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

     Tapeworms attached to the intestinal wall produce eggs that are excreted in feces. After ingestion by animals, the
     eggs hatch and the larvae emerge. They may take up residence in the intestine, but can sometimes move to other
     tissues, especially muscle or brain tissue. When T. solium larvae form cysts in tissue, the condition is called
     cysticercosis. This occurs through ingestion of eggs via the fecal-oral route, not through consumption of
     undercooked meat. It can develop in the muscles, eye (ophthalmic cysticercosis), or brain (neurocysticercosis).
     Infections may be asymptomatic or they may cause mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as epigastric discomfort,
     nausea, diarrhea, flatulence, or hunger pains. It is also common to find visible tapeworm segments passed in the
     stool. In cases of cysticercosis, symptoms differ depending upon where the cysts become established.
     Neurocysticercosis can have severe, life-threatening consequences and is associated with headaches and seizures
     because of the presence of the tapeworm larvae encysted in the brain. Cysts in muscles may be asymptomatic, or
     they may be painful.
     To diagnose these conditions, microscopic analysis of stool samples from three separate days is generally
     recommended. Eggs or body segments, called proglottids, may be visible in these samples. Molecular methods have
     been developed but are not yet widely available. Imaging, such as CT and MRI, may be used to detect cysts.
     Praziquantel or niclosamide are used for treatment.

What's in Your Sushi Roll?

As foods that contain raw fish, such as sushi and sashimi, continue to increase in popularity throughout the world,
so does the risk of parasitic infections carried by raw or undercooked fish. Diphyllobothrium species, known as fish
tapeworms, is one of the main culprits. Evidence suggests that undercooked salmon caused an increase in
Diphyllobothrium infections in British Columbia in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the years since, the number of
reported cases in the United States and Canada has been low, but it is likely that cases are underreported because
the causative agent is not easily recognized.22

Another illness transmitted in undercooked fish is herring worm disease, or anisakiasis, in which nematodes attach
to the epithelium of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine. Cases have increased around the world as raw fish
consumption has increased.23

Although the message may be unpopular with sushi lovers, fish should be frozen or cooked before eating. The
extremely low and high temperatures associated with freezing and cooking kill worms and larvae contained in the
meat, thereby preventing infection. Ingesting fresh, raw sushi may make for a delightful meal, but it also entails
some risk.

Hydatid Disease

Another cestode, Echinococcus granulosus, causes a serious infection known as hydatid disease (cystic
echinococcosis). E. granulosus is found in dogs (the definitive host), as well as several intermediate hosts (sheep,
pigs, goats, cattle). The cestodes are transmitted through eggs in the feces from infected animals, which can be an
occupational hazard for individuals who work in agriculture.

Once ingested, E. granulosus eggs hatch in the small intestine and release the larvae. The larvae invade the
intestinal wall to gain access to the circulatory system. They form hydatid cysts in internal organs, especially in the
lungs and liver, that grow slowly and are often undetected until they become large. If the cysts burst, a severe
allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) may occur.

Cysts present in the liver can cause enlargement of the liver, nausea, vomiting, right epigastric pain, pain in the right
upper quadrant, and possible allergic signs and symptoms. Cysts in the lungs can lead to alveolar disease.
Abdominal pain, weight loss, pain, and malaise may occur, and inflammatory processes develop.

E. granulosus can be detected through imaging (ultrasonography, CT, MRI) that shows the cysts. Serologic tests,
including ELISA and indirect hemagglutinin tests, are used. Cystic disease is most effectively treated with surgery to
remove cysts, but other treatments are also available, including chemotherapy with anti-helminthic drugs
(albendazole or mebendazole).

Flukes

Flukes are flatworms that have a leaflike appearance. They are a type of trematode worm, and multiple species are
associated with disease in humans. The most common are liver flukes and intestinal flukes (Figure 24.38).

     Liver Flukes
     The liver flukes are several species of trematodes that cause disease by interfering with the bile duct. Fascioliasis is
     caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica in contaminated raw or undercooked aquatic plants (e.g.,
     watercress). In Fasciola infection, adult flukes develop in the bile duct and release eggs into the feces. Clonochiasis
     is caused by Clonorchis sinensis in contaminated freshwater fish. Other flukes, such as Opisthorchis viverrini (found
     in fish) and Opisthorchis felineus (found in freshwater snails), also cause infections. Liver flukes spend part of their
     life cycle in freshwater snails, which serve as an intermediate host. Humans are typically infected after eating
     aquatic plants contaminated by the infective larvae after they have left the snail. Once they reach the human
     intestine, they migrate back to the bile duct, where they mature. The life cycle is similar for the other infectious liver
     flukes, (see Figure 5.22).

     When Fasciola flukes cause acute infection, signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash,
     fever, malaise, and breathing difficulties. If the infection becomes chronic, with adult flukes living in the bile duct,
     then cholangitis, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and gallstones may develop. Symptoms are similar for
     infections by other liver flukes. Cholangiocarcinoma can occur from C. sinensis infection. The Opisthorchis species
     can also be associated with cancer development.

     Diagnosis is accomplished using patient history and examination of samples from feces or other samples (such as
     vomitus). Because the eggs may appear similar, immunoassay techniques are available that can help distinguish
     species. The preferred treatment for fascioliasis is triclabendazole. C. sinensis and Opisthorchis spp. infections are
     treated with praziquantel or albendazole.

     Intestinal Flukes
     The intestinal flukes are trematodes that develop in the intestines. Many, such as Fasciolopsis buski, which causes
     fasciolopsiasis, are closely related to liver flukes. Intestinal flukes are ingested from contaminated aquatic plants
     that have not been properly cooked. When the cysts are consumed, the larvae emerge in the duodenum and develop
     into adults while attached to the intestinal epithelium. The eggs are released in stool.

     Intestinal fluke infection is often asymptomatic, but some cases may involve mild diarrhea and abdominal pain.
     More severe symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, allergic reactions, and anemia can sometimes occur, and high
     parasite loads may sometimes lead to intestinal obstructions.

     Diagnosis is the same as with liver flukes: examination of feces or other samples and immunoassay. Praziquantel is
     used to treat infections caused by intestinal flukes.

Resolution

Carli's doctor explained that she had bacterial gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella bacteria. The source of
these bacteria was likely the undercooked egg. Had the egg been fully cooked, the high temperature would have
been sufficient to kill any Salmonella in or on the egg. In this case, enough bacteria survived to cause an
infection once the egg was eaten.

Carli's signs and symptoms continued to worsen. Her fever became higher, her vomiting and diarrhea continued,
and she began to become dehydrated. She felt thirsty all the time and had continual abdominal cramps. Carli's
doctor treated her with intravenous fluids to help with her dehydration, but did not prescribe antibiotics. Carli's
parents were confused because they thought a bacterial infection should always be treated with antibiotics.

The doctor explained that the worst medical problem for Carli was dehydration. Except in the most vulnerable
and sick patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, antibiotics do not reduce recovery time or improve outcomes in
Salmonella infections. In fact, antibiotics can actually delay the natural excretion of bacteria from the body.
Rehydration therapy replenishes lost fluids, diminishing the effects of dehydration and improving the patient's
condition while the infection resolves.

After two days of rehydration therapy, Carli's signs and symptoms began to fade. She was still somewhat thirsty,
but the amount of urine she passed became larger and the color lighter. She stopped vomiting. Her fever was

Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

FIGURE 25.1 Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease that can cause liver damage, resulting in jaundice (left) as well as serious and
sometimes fatal complications. The virus that causes yellow fever is transmitted through the bite of a biological vector, the Aedes aegypti
mosquito (right). (credit left: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit right: modification of work by

INTRODUCTION Yellow fever was once common in the southeastern US, with annual outbreaks of more than
25,000 infections in New Orleans in the mid-1800s.1 In the early 20th century, efforts to eradicate the virus that
causes yellow fever were successful thanks to vaccination programs and effective control (mainly through the
insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT]) of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that serves as a vector. Today,
the virus has been largely eradicated in North America.
Elsewhere, efforts to contain yellow fever have been less successful. Despite mass vaccination campaigns in some
regions, the risk for yellow fever epidemics is rising in dense urban cities in Africa and South America.2 In an
increasingly globalized society, yellow fever could easily make a comeback in North America, where A. aegypti is still
present. If these mosquitoes were exposed to infected individuals, new outbreaks would be possible.
Like yellow fever, many of the circulatory and lymphatic diseases discussed in this chapter are emerging or re-
emerging worldwide. Despite medical advances, diseases like malaria, Ebola, and others could become endemic in
the US given the right circumstances.

        CLINICAL FOCUS

        Part 1

        Barbara is a 43-year-old patient who has been diagnosed with metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. To
        facilitate her ongoing chemotherapy, her physician implanted a port attached to a central venous catheter. At a
        recent checkup, she reported feeling restless and complained that the site of the catheter had become
        uncomfortable. After removing the dressing, the physician observed that the surgical site appeared red and was
        warm to the touch, suggesting a localized infection. Barbara's was also running a fever of 38.2 °C (100.8 °F). Her
        physician treated the affected area with a topical antiseptic and applied a fresh dressing. She also prescribed a
        course of the antibiotic oxacillin.

            · Based on this information, what factors likely contributed to Barbara's condition?
            · What is the most likely source of the microbes involved?

      can facilitate the rapid dissemination of the microorganism to other regions of the body, sometimes with serious
      results. In this section, we will examine some of the key anatomical features of the circulatory and lymphatic
      systems, as well as general signs and symptoms of infection.

      The Circulatory System

      The circulatory (or cardiovascular) system is a closed network of organs and vessels that moves blood around the
      body (Figure 25.2). The primary purposes of the circulatory system are to deliver nutrients, immune factors, and
      oxygen to tissues and to carry away waste products for elimination. The heart is a four-chambered pump that
      propels the blood throughout the body. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the superior vena cava
      and the inferior vena cava after returning from the body. The blood next passes through the tricuspid valve to enter
      the right ventricle. When the heart contracts, the blood from the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonary
      arteries to the lungs. There, the blood is oxygenated at the alveoli and returns to the heart through the pulmonary
      veins. The oxygenated blood is received at the left atrium and proceeds through the mitral valve to the left ventricle.
      When the heart contracts, the oxygenated blood is pumped throughout the body via a series of thick-walled vessels
      called arteries. The first and largest artery is called the aorta. The arteries sequentially branch and decrease in size
      (and are called arterioles) until they end in a network of smaller vessels called capillaries. The capillary beds are
      located in the interstitial spaces within tissues and release nutrients, immune factors, and oxygen to those tissues.
      The capillaries connect to a series of vessels called venules, which increase in size to form the veins. The veins join
      together into larger vessels as they transfer blood back to the heart. The largest veins, the superior and inferior vena
      cava, return the blood to the right atrium.

Other organs play important roles in the circulatory system as well. The kidneys filter the blood, removing waste
products and eliminating them in the urine. The liver also filters the blood and removes damaged or defective red
blood cells. The spleen filters and stores blood, removes damaged red blood cells, and is a reservoir for immune
factors. All of these filtering structures serve as sites for entrapment of microorganisms and help maintain an
environment free of microorganisms in the blood.

The Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system is also a network of vessels that run throughout the body (Figure 25.3). However, these
vessels do not form a full circulating system and are not pressurized by the heart. Rather, the lymphatic system is an
open system with the fluid moving in one direction from the extremities toward two drainage points into veins just
above the heart. Lymphatic fluids move more slowly than blood because they are not pressurized. Small lymph
capillaries interact with blood capillaries in the interstitial spaces in tissues. Fluids from the tissues enter the lymph
capillaries and are drained away (Figure 25.4). These fluids, termed lymph, also contain large numbers of white
blood cells.

Health)

The lymphatic system contains two types of lymphoid tissues. The primary lymphoid tissue includes bone marrow
and the thymus. Bone marrow contains the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that differentiate and mature into the
various types of blood cells and lymphocytes (see Figure 17.12). The secondary lymphoid tissues include the
spleen, lymph nodes, and several areas of diffuse lymphoid tissues underlying epithelial membranes. The spleen,
an encapsulated structure, filters blood and captures pathogens and antigens that pass into it (Figure 25.5). The
spleen contains specialized macrophages and dendritic cells that are crucial for antigen presentation, a mechanism
critical for activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes (see Major Histocompatibility Complexes and Antigen-
Presenting Cells). Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs situated throughout the body. These structures contain
areas called germinal centers that are rich in B and T lymphocytes. The lymph nodes also contain macrophages and
dendritic cells for antigen presentation. Lymph from nearby tissues enters the lymph node through afferent
lymphatic vessels and encounters these lymphocytes as it passes through; the lymph exits the lymph node through
the efferent lymphatic vessels (Figure 25.5).

FIGURE 25.5 (a) The spleen is a lymphatic organ located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen near the stomach and left kidney. It
contains numerous phagocytes and lymphocytes that combat and prevent circulatory infections by killing and removing pathogens from the
blood. (b) Lymph nodes are masses of lymphatic tissue located along the larger lymph vessels. They contain numerous lymphocytes that
kill and remove pathogens from lymphatic fluid that drains from surrounding tissues.

Infections of the Circulatory System

Under normal circumstances, the circulatory system and the blood should be sterile; the circulatory system has no
normal microbiota. Because the system is closed, there are no easy portals of entry into the circulatory system for
microbes. Those that are able to breach the body's physical barriers and enter the bloodstream encounter a host of
circulating immune defenses, such as antibodies, complement proteins, phagocytes, and other immune cells.
Microbes often gain access to the circulatory system through a break in the skin (e.g., wounds, needles, intravenous
catheters, insect bites) or spread to the circulatory system from infections in other body sites. For example,
microorganisms causing pneumonia or renal infection may enter the local circulation of the lung or kidney and
1010  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

      spread from there throughout the circulatory network.

      If microbes in the bloodstream are not quickly eliminated, they can spread rapidly throughout the body, leading to
      serious, even life-threatening infections. Various terms are used to describe conditions involving microbes in the
      circulatory system. The term bacteremia refers to bacteria in the blood. If bacteria are reproducing in the blood as
      they spread, this condition is called septicemia. The presence of viruses in the blood is called viremia. Microbial
      toxins can also be spread through the circulatory system, causing a condition termed toxemia.

      Microbes and microbial toxins in the blood can trigger an inflammatory response so severe that the inflammation
      damages host tissues and organs more than the infection itself. This counterproductive immune response is called
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and it can lead to the life-threatening condition known as
      sepsis. Sepsis is characterized by the production of excess cytokines that leads to classic signs of inflammation
      such as fever, vasodilation, and edema (see Inflammation and Fever). In a patient with sepsis, the inflammatory
      response becomes dysregulated and disproportionate to the threat of infection. Critical organs such as the heart,
      lungs, liver, and kidneys become dysfunctional, resulting in increased heart and respiratory rates, and
      disorientation. If not treated promptly and effectively, patients with sepsis can go into shock and die.

      Certain infections can cause inflammation in the heart and blood vessels. Inflammation of the endocardium, the
      inner lining of the heart, is called endocarditis and can result in damage to the heart valves severe enough to
      require surgical replacement. Inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, is called pericarditis.
      The term myocarditis refers to the inflammation of the heart's muscle tissue. Pericarditis and myocarditis can cause
      fluid to accumulate around the heart, resulting in congestive heart failure. Inflammation of blood vessels is called
      vasculitis. Although somewhat rare, vasculitis can cause blood vessels to become damaged and rupture; as blood is
      released, small red or purple spots called petechiae appear on the skin. If the damage of tissues or blood vessels is
      severe, it can result in reduced blood flow to the surrounding tissues. This condition is called ischemia, and it can be
      very serious. In severe cases, the affected tissues can die and become necrotic; these situations may require
      surgical debridement or amputation.

          · Explain why the presence of microbes in the circulatory system can lead to serious consequences.

      Infections of the Lymphatic System

      Like the circulatory system, the lymphatic system does not have a normal microbiota, and the large numbers of
      immune cells typically eliminate transient microbes before they can establish an infection. Only microbes with an
      array of virulence factors are able to overcome these defenses and establish infection in the lymphatic system.
      However, when a localized infection begins to spread, the lymphatic system is often the first place the invading
      microbes can be detected.

      Infections in the lymphatic system also trigger an inflammatory response. Inflammation of lymphatic vessels, called
      lymphangitis, can produce visible red streaks under the skin. Inflammation in the lymph nodes can cause them to
      swell. A swollen lymph node is referred to as a bubo, and the condition is referred to as lymphadenitis.

system. In most cases, the bacteremia that results from such common exposures is transient and remains below
the threshold of detection. In severe cases, bacteremia can lead to septicemia with dangerous complications such
as toxemia, sepsis, and septic shock. In these situations, it is often the immune response to the infection that
results in the clinical signs and symptoms rather than the microbes themselves.

Bacterial Sepsis, Septic and Toxic Shock

At low concentrations, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)
play important roles in the host's immune defenses. When they circulate systemically in larger amounts, however,
the resulting immune response can be life threatening. IL-1 induces vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and
reduces the tight junctions between vascular endothelial cells, leading to widespread edema. As fluids move out of
circulation into tissues, blood pressure begins to drop. If left unchecked, the blood pressure can fall below the level
necessary to maintain proper kidney and respiratory functions, a condition known as septic shock. In addition, the
excessive release of cytokines during the inflammatory response can lead to the formation of blood clots. The loss
of blood pressure and occurrence of blood clots can result in multiple organ failure and death.
Bacteria are the most common pathogens associated with the development of sepsis, and septic shock.3 The most
common infection associated with sepsis is bacterial pneumonia (see Bacterial Infections of the Respiratory Tract),
accounting for about half of all cases, followed by intra-abdominal infections (Bacterial Infections of the
Gastrointestinal Tract) and urinary tract infections (Bacterial Infections of the Urinary System).4 Infections
associated with superficial wounds, animal bites, and indwelling catheters may also lead to sepsis and septic shock.

These initially minor, localized infections can be caused by a wide range of different bacteria, including
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Pasteurella, Acinetobacter, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
However, if left untreated, infections by these gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens can potentially progress
to sepsis, shock, and death.

Toxic Shock Syndrome and Streptococcal Toxic Shock-Like Syndrome
Toxemia associated with infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus can cause staphylococcal toxic shock
syndrome (TSS). Some strains of S. aureus produce a superantigen called toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).
TSS may occur as a complication of other localized or systemic infections such as pneumonia, osteomyelitis,
sinusitis, and skin wounds (surgical, traumatic, or burns). Those at highest risk for staphylococcal TSS are people
with preexisting S. aureus colonization of the vagina who leave tampons, contraceptive sponges, diaphragms, or
other devices in the vagina for longer than the recommended time.

Staphylococcal TSS is characterized by sudden onset of vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, body temperature higher than
38.9 °C (102.0 °F), and rapid-onset hypotension with a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg for adults; a
diffuse erythematous rash that leads to peeling and shedding skin 1 to 2 weeks after onset; and additional
involvement of three or more organ systems.5 The mortality rate associated with staphylococcal TSS is less than 3%
of cases.

Diagnosis of staphylococcal TSS is based on clinical signs, symptoms, serologic tests to confirm bacterial species,
and the detection of toxin production from staphylococcal isolates. Cultures of skin and blood are often negative;
less than 5% are positive in cases of staphylococcal TSS. Treatment for staphylococcal TSS includes
decontamination, debridement, vasopressors to elevate blood pressure, and antibiotic therapy with clindamycin
plus vancomycin or daptomycin pending susceptibility results.

      A syndrome with signs and symptoms similar to staphylococcal TSS can be caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. This
      condition, called streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSS), is characterized by more severe
      pathophysiology than staphylococcal TSS,6 with about 50% of patients developing S. pyogenes bacteremia and
      necrotizing fasciitis. In contrast to staphylococcal TSS, STSS is more likely to cause acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS), a rapidly progressive disease characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs that inhibits
      breathing and causes hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). STSS is associated with a higher mortality rate
      (20%-60%), even with aggressive therapy. STSS usually develops in patients with a streptococcal soft-tissue
      infection such as bacterial cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis (pus formation in muscle caused by infection),
      a recent influenza A infection, or chickenpox.

      Puerperal Sepsis

      A type of sepsis called puerperal sepsis, also known as puerperal infection, puerperal fever, or childbed fever, is a
      nosocomial infection associated with the period of puerperium--the time following childbirth during which a
      person's reproductive system returns to a nonpregnant state. Such infections may originate in the genital tract,
      breast, urinary tract, or a surgical wound. Initially the infection may be limited to the uterus or other local site of
      infection, but it can quickly spread, resulting in peritonitis, septicemia, and death. Before the 19th century work of
      Ignaz Semmelweis and the widespread acceptance of germ theory (see Modern Foundations of Cell Theory),
      puerperal sepsis was a major cause of mortality among new mothers in the first few days following childbirth.

      Puerperal sepsis is often associated with Streptococcus pyogenes, but numerous other bacteria can also be
      responsible. Examples include gram-positive bacterial (e.g. Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and
      Enterococcus spp.), gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Chlamydia spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp.),
      as well as anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., and Clostridium spp. In cases caused by S.
      pyogenes, the bacteria attach to host tissues using M protein and produce a carbohydrate capsule to avoid
      phagocytosis. S. pyogenes also produces a variety of exotoxins, like streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and B, that
      are associated with virulence and may function as superantigens.

      Diagnosis of puerperal fever is based on the timing and extent of fever and isolation, and identification of the
      etiologic agent in blood, wound, or urine specimens. Because there are numerous possible causes, antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing must be used to determine the best antibiotic for treatment. Nosocomial incidence of
      puerperal fever can be greatly reduced through the use of antiseptics during delivery and strict adherence to
      handwashing protocols by doctors, midwives, and nurses.

Infectious Arthritis

Also called septic arthritis, infectious arthritis can be either an acute or a chronic condition. Infectious arthritis is
characterized by inflammation of joint tissues and is most often caused by bacterial pathogens. Most cases of acute
infectious arthritis are secondary to bacteremia, with a rapid onset of moderate to severe joint pain and swelling
that limits the motion of the affected joint. In adults and young children, the infective pathogen is most often
introduced directly through injury, such as a wound or a surgical site, and brought to the joint through the circulatory
system. Acute infections may also occur after joint replacement surgery. Acute infectious arthritis often occurs in
patients with an immune system impaired by other viral and bacterial infections. S. aureus is the most common
cause of acute septic arthritis in the general population of adults and young children. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an
important cause of acute infectious arthritis in sexually active individuals.

Chronic infectious arthritis is responsible for 5% of all infectious arthritis cases and is more likely to occur in
patients with other illnesses or conditions. Patients at risk include those who have an HIV infection, a bacterial or
fungal infection, prosthetic joints, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or who are undergoing immunosuppressive
chemotherapy. Onset is often in a single joint; there may be little or no pain, aching pain that may be mild, gradual
swelling, mild warmth, and minimal or no redness of the joint area.

Diagnosis of infectious arthritis requires the aspiration of a small quantity of synovial fluid from the afflicted joint.
Direct microscopic evaluation, culture, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analyses of the synovial fluid are used to identify the potential pathogen. Typical treatment includes administration
of appropriate antimicrobial drugs based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For nondrug-resistant bacterial
strains, -lactams such as oxacillin and cefazolin are often prescribed for staphylococcal infections. Third-
generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) are used for increasingly prevalent -lactam-resistant Neisseria
infections. Infections by Mycobacterium spp. or fungi are treated with appropriate long-term antimicrobial therapy.
Even with treatment, the prognosis is often poor for those infected. About 40% of patients with nongonnococcal
infectious arthritis will suffer permanent joint damage and mortality rates range from 5% to 20%.7 Mortality rates
are higher among the elderly.8

Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of bone tissues most commonly caused by infection. These infections can either be
acute or chronic and can involve a variety of different bacteria. The most common causative agent of osteomyelitis
is S. aureus. However, M. tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, species in
the Enterobacteriaceae, and other microorganisms can also cause osteomyelitis, depending on which bones are
involved. In adults, bacteria usually gain direct access to the bone tissues through trauma or a surgical procedure
involving prosthetic joints. In children, the bacteria are often introduced from the bloodstream, possibly spreading
from focal infections. The long bones, such as the femur, are more commonly affected in children because of the
more extensive vascularization of bones in the young.9

The signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis include fever, localized pain, swelling due to edema, and ulcers in soft
tissues near the site of infection. The resulting inflammation can lead to tissue damage and bone loss. In addition,
the infection may spread to joints, resulting in infectious arthritis, or disseminate into the blood, resulting in sepsis
and thrombosis (formation of blood clots). Like septic arthritis, osteomyelitis is usually diagnosed using a
combination of radiography, imaging, and identification of bacteria from blood cultures, or from bone cultures if
blood cultures are negative. Parenteral antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat osteomyelitis. Because of the
number of different possible etiologic agents, however, a variety of drugs might be used. Broad-spectrum
antibacterial drugs such as nafcillin, oxacillin, or cephalosporin are typically prescribed for acute osteomyelitis, and
ampicillin and piperacillin/tazobactam for chronic osteomyelitis. In cases of antibiotic resistance, vancomycin
treatment is sometimes required to control the infection. In serious cases, surgery to remove the site of infection
may be required. Other forms of treatment include hyperbaric oxygen therapy (see Using Physical Methods to
Control Microorganisms) and implantation of antibiotic beads or pumps.

          · What bacterium the most common cause of both septic arthritis and osteomyelitis?

      Rheumatic Fever

      Infections with S. pyogenes have a variety of manifestations and complications generally called sequelae. As
      mentioned, the bacterium can cause suppurative infections like puerperal fever. However, this microbe can also
      cause nonsuppurative sequelae in the form of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which can lead to rheumatic heart
      disease, thus impacting the circulatory system. Rheumatic fever occurs primarily in children a minimum of 2-3
      weeks after an episode of untreated or inadequately treated pharyngitis (see Bacterial Infections of the Respiratory
      Tract). At one time, rheumatic fever was a major killer of children in the US; today, however, it is rare in the US
      because of early diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics. In parts of the world where
      diagnosis and treatment are not readily available, acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are still major
      causes of mortality in children.10

      Rheumatic fever is characterized by a variety of diagnostic signs and symptoms caused by nonsuppurative, immune-
      mediated damage resulting from a cross-reaction between patient antibodies to bacterial surface proteins and
      similar proteins found on cardiac, neuronal, and synovial tissues. Damage to the nervous tissue or joints, which
      leads to joint pain and swelling, is reversible. However, damage to heart valves can be irreversible and is worsened
      by repeated episodes of acute rheumatic fever, particularly during the first 3-5 years after the first rheumatic fever
      attack. The inflammation of the heart valves caused by cross-reacting antibodies leads to scarring and stiffness of
      the valve leaflets. This, in turn, produces a characteristic heart murmur. Patients who have previously developed
      rheumatic fever and who subsequently develop recurrent pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes are at high risk for a
      recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever.
      The American Heart Association recommends11 a treatment regimen consisting of benzathine benzylpenicillin
      every 3 or 4 weeks, depending on the patient's risk for reinfection. Additional prophylactic antibiotic treatment may
      be recommended depending on the age of the patient and risk for reinfection.

      Bacterial Endocarditis and Pericarditis

      The endocardium is a tissue layer that lines the muscles and valves of the heart. This tissue can become infected by
      a variety of bacteria, including gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, and
      Enterococcus faecalis, and the gram-negative so-called HACEK bacilli: Haemophilus spp., Actinobacillus
      actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. The resulting
      inflammation is called endocarditis, which can be described as either acute or subacute. Causative agents typically
      enter the bloodstream during accidental or intentional breaches in the normal barrier defenses (e.g., dental
      procedures, body piercings, catheterization, wounds). Individuals with preexisting heart damage, prosthetic valves
      and other cardiac devices, and those with a history of rheumatic fever have a higher risk for endocarditis. This
      disease can rapidly destroy the heart valves and, if untreated, lead to death in just a few days.

      In subacute bacterial endocarditis, heart valve damage occurs slowly over a period of months. During this time,
      blood clots form in the heart, and these protect the bacteria from phagocytes. These patches of tissue-associated
      bacteria are called vegetations. The resulting damage to the heart, in part resulting from the immune response
      causing fibrosis of heart valves, can necessitate heart valve replacement (Figure 25.6). Outward signs of subacute
      endocarditis may include a fever.

      Diagnosis of infective endocarditis is determined using the combination of blood cultures, echocardiogram, and
      clinical symptoms. In both acute and subacute endocarditis, treatment typically involves relatively high doses of

intravenous antibiotics as determined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Acute endocarditis is often treated
with a combination of ampicillin, nafcillin, and gentamicin for synergistic coverage of Staphylococcus spp. and
Streptococcus spp. Prosthetic-valve endocarditis is often treated with a combination of vancomycin, rifampin, and
gentamicin. Rifampin is necessary to treat individuals with infection of prosthetic valves or other foreign bodies
because rifampin can penetrate the biofilm of most of the pathogens that infect these devices.

Staphylcoccus spp. and Streptococcus spp. can also infect and cause inflammation in the tissues surrounding the
heart, a condition called acute pericarditis. Pericarditis is marked by chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a dry
cough. In most cases, pericarditis is self-limiting and clinical intervention is not necessary. Diagnosis is made with
the aid of a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, aspirate of pericardial fluid, or biopsy of
pericardium. Antibacterial medications may be prescribed for infections associated with pericarditis; however,
pericarditis can also be caused other pathogens, including viruses (e.g., echovirus, influenza virus), fungi (e.g.,
Histoplasma spp., Coccidioides spp.), and eukaryotic parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma spp.).

Gas Gangrene

Traumatic injuries or certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, can cause damage to blood vessels that
interrupts blood flow to a region of the body. When blood flow is interrupted, tissues begin to die, creating an
anaerobic environment in which anaerobic bacteria can thrive. This condition is called ischemia. Endospores of the
anaerobic bacterium Clostridium perfringens (along with a number of other Clostridium spp. from the gut) can
readily germinate in ischemic tissues and colonize the anaerobic tissues.

The resulting infection, called gas gangrene, is characterized by rapidly spreading myonecrosis (death of muscle
tissue). The patient experiences a sudden onset of excruciating pain at the infection site and the rapid development
of a foul-smelling wound containing gas bubbles and a thin, yellowish discharge tinged with a small amount of
blood. As the infection progresses, edema and cutaneous blisters containing bluish-purple fluid form. The infected
tissue becomes liquefied and begins sloughing off. The margin between necrotic and healthy tissue often advances
several inches per hour even with antibiotic therapy. Septic shock and organ failure frequently accompany gas
gangrene; when patients develop sepsis, the mortality rate is greater than 50%.

-Toxin and theta () toxin are the major virulence factors of C. perfringens implicated in gas gangrene. -Toxin is a
lipase responsible for breaking down cell membranes; it also causes the formation of thrombi (blood clots) in blood
vessels, contributing to the spread of ischemia. -Toxin forms pores in the patient's cell membranes, causing cell
1016  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

      lysis. The gas associated with gas gangrene is produced by Clostridium's fermentation of butyric acid, which
      produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide that are released as the bacteria multiply, forming pockets of gas in tissues
      (Figure 25.7).

      Gas gangrene is initially diagnosed based on the presence of the clinical signs and symptoms described earlier in
      this section. Diagnosis can be confirmed through Gram stain and anaerobic cultivation of wound exudate (drainage)
      and tissue samples on blood agar. Treatment typically involves surgical debridement of any necrotic tissue;
      advanced cases may require amputation. Surgeons may also use vacuum-assisted closure (VAC), a surgical
      technique in which vacuum-assisted drainage is used to remove blood or serous fluid from a wound or surgical site
      to speed recovery. The most common antibiotic treatments include penicillin G and clindamycin. Some cases are
      also treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy because Clostridium spp. are incapable of surviving in oxygen-rich
      environments.

      margin of the discolored tissue indicating the spread of infection. (b) A radiograph of the arm shows a darkening in the tissue, which

      Tularemia

      Infection with the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis causes tularemia (or rabbit fever), a zoonotic
      infection in humans. F. tularensis is a facultative intracellular parasite that primarily causes illness in rabbits,
      although a wide variety of domesticated animals are also susceptible to infection. Humans can be infected through
      ingestion of contaminated meat or, more typically, handling of infected animal tissues (e.g., skinning an infected
      rabbit). Tularemia can also be transmitted by the bites of infected arthropods, including the dog tick (Dermacentor
      variabilis), the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), the wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), and deer flies
      (Chrysops spp.). Although the disease is not directly communicable between humans, exposure to aerosols of F.
      tularensis can result in life-threatening infections. F. tularensis is highly contagious, with an infectious dose of as
      few as 10 bacterial cells. In addition, pulmonary infections have a 30%-60% fatality rate if untreated.12 For these
      reasons, F. tularensis is currently classified and must be handled as a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) organism and as a
      potential biological warfare agent.
      Following introduction through a break in the skin, the bacteria initially move to the lymph nodes, where they are
      ingested by phagocytes. After escaping from the phagosome, the bacteria grow and multiply intracellularly in the
      cytoplasm of phagocytes. They can later become disseminated through the blood to other organs such as the liver,
      lungs, and spleen, where they produce masses of tissue called granulomas (Figure 25.8). After an incubation period
      of about 3 days, skin lesions develop at the site of infection. Other signs and symptoms include fever, chills,
      headache, and swollen and painful lymph nodes.

electron micrograph shows the coccobacilli cells (blue) of F. tularensis. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; credit b: modification of work by NIAID)

A direct diagnosis of tularemia is challenging because it is so contagious. Once a presumptive diagnosis of tularemia
is made, special handling is required to collect and process patients' specimens to prevent the infection of health-
care workers. Specimens suspected of containing F. tularensis can only be handled by BSL-2 or BSL-3 laboratories
registered with the Federal Select Agent Program, and individuals handling the specimen must wear protective
equipment and use a class II biological safety cabinet.

Tularemia is relatively rare in the US, and its signs and symptoms are similar to a variety of other infections that may
need to be ruled out before a diagnosis can be made. Direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) microscopic examination
using antibodies specific for F. tularensis can rapidly confirm the presence of this pathogen. Culturing this microbe is
difficult because of its requirement for the amino acid cysteine, which must be supplied as an extra nutrient in
culturing media. Serological tests are available to detect an immune response against the bacterial pathogen. In
patients with suspected infection, acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples are required to confirm an active
infection. PCR-based tests can also be used for clinical identification of direct specimens from body fluids or tissues
as well as cultured specimens. In most cases, diagnosis is based on clinical findings and likely incidents of exposure
to the bacterium. The antibiotics streptomycin, gentamycin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin are effective in treating
tularemia.

Brucellosis

Species in the genus Brucella are gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogens that appear as coccobacilli.
Several species cause zoonotic infections in animals and humans, four of which have significant human
pathogenicity: B. abortus from cattle and buffalo, B. canis from dogs, B. suis from swine, and B. melitensis from
goats, sheep, and camels. Infections by these pathogens are called brucellosis, also known as undulant fever,
"Mediterranean fever," or "Malta fever." Alice Katherine Evans first determined that Brucella infections present in
cows could be transmitted to humans through milk. Her findings were disputed for years before being accepted;
people began pasteurizing milk (heating it to interfere with microorganisms), which led to a sharp reduction in the
related diseases. Vaccination of animals has made brucellosis a rare disease in the US, but it is still common in the
Mediterranean, south and central Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Human infections are
primarily associated with the ingestion of meat or unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals. Infection can
also occur through inhalation of bacteria in aerosols when handling animal products, or through direct contact with
skin wounds. In the US, most cases of brucellosis are found in individuals with extensive exposure to potentially
infected animals (e.g., slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians).

Two important virulence factors produced by Brucella spp. are urease, which allows ingested bacteria to avoid
destruction by stomach acid, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which allows the bacteria to survive within phagocytes.
After gaining entry to tissues, the bacteria are phagocytized by host neutrophils and macrophages. The bacteria
then escape from the phagosome and grow within the cytoplasm of the cell. Bacteria phagocytized by macrophages
are disseminated throughout the body. This results in the formation of granulomas within many body sites, including
bone, liver, spleen, lung, genitourinary tract, brain, heart, eye, and skin. Acute infections can result in undulant
1018  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

      (relapsing) fever, but untreated infections develop into chronic disease that usually manifests as acute febrile illness
      (fever of 40-41 °C [104-105.8 °F]) with recurring flu-like signs and symptoms.

      Brucella is only reliably found in the blood during the acute fever stage; it is difficult to diagnose by cultivation. In
      addition, Brucella is considered a BSL-3 pathogen and is hazardous to handle in the clinical laboratory without
      protective clothing and at least a class II biological safety cabinet. Agglutination tests are most often used for
      serodiagnosis. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are available to determine exposure to
      the organism. The antibiotics doxycycline or ciprofloxacin are typically prescribed in combination with rifampin;
      gentamicin, streptomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) are also effective against Brucella
      infections and can be used if needed.

      Cat-Scratch Disease

      The zoonosis cat-scratch disease (CSD) (or cat-scratch fever) is a bacterial infection that can be introduced to the
      lymph nodes when a human is bitten or scratched by a cat. It is caused by the facultative intracellular gram-negative
      bacterium Bartonella henselae. Cats can become infected from flea feces containing B. henselae that they ingest
      while grooming. Humans become infected when flea feces or cat saliva (from claws or licking) containing B.
      henselae are introduced at the site of a bite or scratch. Once introduced into a wound, B. henselae infects red blood
      cells.

      B. henselae invasion of red blood cells is facilitated by adhesins associated with outer membrane proteins and a
      secretion system that mediates transport of virulence factors into the host cell. Evidence of infection is indicated if a
      small nodule with pus forms in the location of the scratch 1 to 3 weeks after the initial injury. The bacteria then
      migrate to the nearest lymph nodes, where they cause swelling and pain. Signs and symptoms may also include
      fever, chills, and fatigue. Most infections are mild and tend to be self-limiting. However, immunocompromised
      patients may develop bacillary angiomatosis (BA), characterized by the proliferation of blood vessels, resulting in
      the formation of tumor-like masses in the skin and internal organs; or bacillary peliosis (BP), characterized by
      multiple cyst-like, blood-filled cavities in the liver and spleen. Most cases of CSD can be prevented by keeping cats
      free of fleas and promptly cleaning a cat scratch with soap and warm water.

      The diagnosis of CSD is difficult because the bacterium does not grow readily in the laboratory. When necessary,
      immunofluorescence, serological tests, PCR, and gene sequencing can be performed to identify the bacterial
      species. Given the limited nature of these infections, antibiotics are not normally prescribed. For
      immunocompromised patients, rifampin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin (intramuscularly), or TMP-SMZ are
      generally the most effective options.

      Rat-Bite Fever

      The zoonotic infection rat-bite fever can be caused by two different gram-negative bacteria: Streptobacillus
      moniliformis, which is more common in North America, and Spirillum minor, which is more common in Asia.
      Because of modern sanitation efforts, rat bites are rare in the US. However, contact with fomites, food, or water
      contaminated by rat feces or body fluids can also cause infections. Signs and symptoms of rat-bite fever include
      fever, vomiting, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), and a maculopapular rash on the hands and feet. An
      ulcer may also form at the site of a bite, along with some swelling of nearby lymph nodes. In most cases, the
      infection is self-limiting. Little is known about the virulence factors that contribute to these signs and symptoms of
      disease.

      Cell culture, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, PCR, or ELISA can be used in the identification of Streptobacillus
      moniliformis. The diagnosis Spirillum minor may be confirmed by direct microscopic observation of the pathogens in
      blood using Giemsa or Wright stains, or darkfield microscopy. Serological tests can be used to detect a host immune
      response to the pathogens after about 10 days. The most commonly used antibiotics to treat these infections are
      penicillin or doxycycline.

Plague

The gram-negative bacillus Yersinia pestis causes the zoonotic infection plague. This bacterium causes acute febrile
disease in animals, usually rodents or other small mammals, and humans. The disease is associated with a high
mortality rate if left untreated. Historically, Y. pestis has been responsible for several devastating pandemics,
resulting in millions of deaths (see Micro Connections: The History of the Plague). There are three forms of plague:
bubonic plague (the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases), pneumonic plague, and septicemic
plague. These forms are differentiated by the mode of transmission and the initial site of infection. Figure 25.9
illustrates these various modes of transmission and infection between animals and humans.

In bubonic plague, Y. pestis is transferred by the bite of infected fleas. Since most flea bites occur on the legs and
ankles, Y. pestis is often introduced into the tissues and blood circulation in the lower extremities. After a 2- to
6-day incubation period, patients experience an abrupt onset fever (39.5-41 °C [103.1-105.8 °F]), headache,
hypotension, and chills. The pathogen localizes in lymph nodes, where it causes inflammation, swelling, and
hemorrhaging that results in purple buboes (Figure 25.10). Buboes often form in lymph nodes of the groin first
because these are the nodes associated with the lower limbs; eventually, through circulation in the blood and
lymph, lymph nodes throughout the body become infected and form buboes. The average mortality rate for bubonic
plague is about 55% if untreated and about 10% with antibiotic treatment.

Septicemic plague occurs when Y. pestis is directly introduced into the bloodstream through a cut or wound and
circulates through the body. The incubation period for septicemic plague is 1 to 3 days, after which patients develop
fever, chills, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, and shock. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can also
occur, resulting in the formation of thrombi that obstruct blood vessels and promote ischemia and necrosis in
surrounding tissues (Figure 25.10). Necrosis occurs most commonly in extremities such as fingers and toes, which
become blackened. Septicemic plague can quickly lead to death, with a mortality rate near 100% when it is
untreated. Even with antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate is about 50%.

Pneumonic plague occurs when Y. pestis causes an infection of the lungs. This can occur through inhalation of
aerosolized droplets from an infected individual or when the infection spreads to the lungs from elsewhere in the
body in patients with bubonic or septicemic plague. After an incubation period of 1 to 3 days, signs and symptoms
include fever, headache, weakness, and a rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, and
cough producing bloody or watery mucus. The pneumonia may result in rapid respiratory failure and shock.
Pneumonic plague is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person by infectious aerosol droplet.
If untreated, the mortality rate is near 100%; with antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate is about 50%.
1020  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

      FIGURE 25.9 Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has numerous modes of transmission. The modes are divided into two
      ecological classes: urban and sylvatic (i.e., forest or rural). The urban cycle primarily involves transmission from infected urban mammals
      (rats) to humans by flea vectors (brown arrows). The disease may travel between urban centers (purple arrow) if infected rats find their way
      onto ships or trains. The sylvatic cycle involves mammals more common in nonurban environments. Sylvatic birds and mammals (including
      humans) may become infected after eating infected mammals (pink arrows) or by flea vectors. Pneumonic transmission occurs between
      humans or between humans and infected animals through the inhalation of Y. pestis in aerosols. (credit "diagram": modification of work by

The high mortality rate for the plague is, in part, a consequence of it being unusually well equipped with virulence
factors. To date, there are at least 15 different major virulence factors that have been identified from Y. pestis and,
of these, eight are involved with adherence to host cells. In addition, the F1 component of the Y. pestis capsule is a
virulence factor that allows the bacterium to avoid phagocytosis. F1 is produced in large quantities during
mammalian infection and is the most immunogenic component.13 Successful use of virulence factors allows the
bacilli to disseminate from the area of the bite to regional lymph nodes and eventually the entire blood and
lymphatic systems.

Culturing and direct microscopic examination of a sample of fluid from a bubo, blood, or sputum is the best way to
identify Y. pestis and confirm a presumptive diagnosis of plague. Specimens may be stained using either a Gram,
Giemsa, Wright, or Wayson's staining technique (Figure 25.11). The bacteria show a characteristic bipolar staining
pattern, resembling safety pins, that facilitates presumptive identification. Direct fluorescent antibody tests (rapid
test of outer-membrane antigens) and serological tests like ELISA can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The
confirmatory method for identifying Y. pestis isolates in the US is bacteriophage lysis.

Prompt antibiotic therapy can resolve most cases of bubonic plague, but septicemic and pneumonic plague are
more difficult to treat because of their shorter incubation stages. Survival often depends on an early and accurate
diagnosis and an appropriate choice of antibiotic therapy. In the US, the most common antibiotics used to treat
patients with plague are gentamicin, fluoroquinolones, streptomycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline.

The History of the Plague

The first recorded pandemic of plague, the Justinian plague, occurred in the sixth century CE. It is thought to have
originated in central Africa and spread to the Mediterranean through trade routes. At its peak, more than 5,000
people died per day in Constantinople alone. Ultimately, one-third of that city's population succumbed to plague.14
The impact of this outbreak probably contributed to the later fall of Emperor Justinian.

      The second major pandemic, dubbed the Black Death, occurred during the 14th century. This time, the infections
      are thought to have originated somewhere in Asia before being transported to Europe by trade, soldiers, and war
      refugees. This outbreak killed an estimated one-quarter of the population of Europe (25 million, primarily in major
      cities). In addition, at least another 25 million are thought to have been killed in Asia and Africa.15 This second
      pandemic, associated with strain Yersinia pestis biovar Medievalis, cycled for another 300 years in Europe and Great
      Britain, and was called the Great Plague in the 1660s.

      The most recent pandemic occurred in the 1890s with Yersinia pestis biovar Orientalis. This outbreak originated in
      the Yunnan province of China and spread worldwide through trade. It is at this time that plague made its way to the
      US. The etiologic agent of plague was discovered by Alexandre Yersin (1863-1943) during this outbreak as well. The
      overall number of deaths was lower than in prior outbreaks, perhaps because of improved sanitation and medical
      support.16 Most of the deaths attributed to this final pandemic occurred in India.

      Zoonotic Febrile Diseases

      A wide variety of zoonotic febrile diseases (diseases that cause fever) are caused by pathogenic bacteria that
      require arthropod vectors. These pathogens are either obligate intracellular species of Anaplasma, Bartonella,
      Ehrlichia, Orientia, and Rickettsia, or spirochetes in the genus Borrelia. Isolation and identification of pathogens in
      this group are best performed in BSL-3 laboratories because of the low infective dose associated with the diseases.

      Anaplasmosis
      The zoonotic tickborne disease human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is caused by the obligate intracellular
      pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum. HGA is endemic primarily in the central and northeastern US and in
      countries in Europe and Asia.

      HGA is usually a mild febrile disease that causes flu-like symptoms in immunocompetent patients; however,
      symptoms are severe enough to require hospitalization in at least 50% of infections and, of those patients, less than
      1% will die of HGA.17 Small mammals such as white-footed mice, chipmunks, and voles have been identified as
      reservoirs of A. phagocytophilum, which is transmitted by the bite of an Ixodes tick. Five major virulence factors18
      have been reported in Anaplasma; three are adherence factors and two are factors that allow the pathogen to avoid
      the human immune response. Diagnostic approaches include locating intracellular microcolonies of Anaplasma
      through microscopic examination of neutrophils or eosinophils stained with Giemsa or Wright stain, PCR for
      detection of A. phagocytophilum, and serological tests to detect antibody titers against the pathogens. The primary
      antibiotic used for treatment is doxycycline.

Ehrlichiosis
Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a zoonotic tickborne disease caused by the BSL-2, obligate
intracellular pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Currently, the geographic distribution of HME is primarily the eastern
half of the US, with a few cases reported in the West, which corresponds with the known geographic distribution of
the primary vector, the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). Symptoms of HME are similar to the flu-like
symptoms observed in anaplasmosis, but a rash is more common, with 60% of children and less than 30% of adults
developing petechial, macula, and maculopapular rashes.19 Virulence factors allow E. chaffeensis to adhere to and
infect monocytes, forming intracellular microcolonies in monocytes that are diagnostic for the HME. Diagnosis of
HME can be confirmed with PCR and serologic tests. The first-line treatment for adults and children of all ages with
HME is doxycycline.

Epidemic Typhus
The disease epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii and is transmitted by body lice, Pediculus
humanus. Flying squirrels are animal reservoirs of R. prowazekii in North America and can also be sources of lice
capable of transmitting the pathogen. Epidemic typhus is characterized by a high fever and body aches that last for
about 2 weeks. A rash develops on the abdomen and chest and radiates to the extremities. Severe cases can result
in death from shock or damage to heart and brain tissues. Infected humans are an important reservoir for this
bacterium because R. prowazekii is the only Rickettsia that can establish a chronic carrier state in humans.

Epidemic typhus has played an important role in human history, causing large outbreaks with high mortality rates
during times of war or adversity. During World War I, epidemic typhus killed more than 3 million people on the
Eastern front.20 With the advent of effective insecticides and improved personal hygiene, epidemic typhus is now
quite rare in the US. In the developing world, however, epidemics can lead to mortality rates of up to 40% in the
absence of treatment.21 In recent years, most outbreaks have taken place in Burundi, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. For
example, an outbreak in Burundi refugee camps in 1997 resulted in 45,000 illnesses in a population of about
760,000 people.22

A rapid diagnosis is difficult because of the similarity of the primary symptoms with those of many other diseases.
Molecular and immunohistochemical diagnostic tests are the most useful methods for establishing a diagnosis
during the acute stage of illness when therapeutic decisions are critical. PCR to detect distinctive genes from R.
prowazekii can be used to confirm the diagnosis of epidemic typhus, along with immunofluorescent staining of
tissue biopsy specimens. Serology is usually used to identify rickettsial infections. However, adequate antibody
titers take up to 10 days to develop. Antibiotic therapy is typically begun before the diagnosis is complete. The most
common drugs used to treat patients with epidemic typhus are doxycycline or chloramphenicol.

Murine (Endemic) Typhus
Murine typhus (also known as endemic typhus) is caused by Rickettsia typhi and is transmitted by the bite of the rat
flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, with infected rats as the main reservoir. Clinical signs and symptoms of murine typhus
include a rash and chills accompanied by headache and fever that last about 12 days. Some patients also exhibit a
cough and pneumonia-like symptoms. Severe illness can develop in immunocompromised patients, with seizures,
coma, and renal and respiratory failure.

Clinical diagnosis of murine typhus can be confirmed from a biopsy specimen from the rash. Diagnostic tests include
indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) staining, PCR for R. typhi, and acute and convalescent serologic testing.
Primary treatment is doxycycline, with chloramphenicol as the second choice.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
The disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii and is transmitted by the bite
of a hard-bodied tick such as the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), Rocky Mountain wood tick (D.
andersoni), or brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus).

      This disease is endemic in North and South America and its incidence is coincident with the arthropod vector range.
      Despite its name, most cases in the US do not occur in the Rocky Mountain region but in the Southeast; North
      Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri account for greater than 60% of all cases.23 The map in
      Figure 25.12 shows the distribution of prevalence in the US in 2010.

      FIGURE 25.12 In the US, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is most prevalent in the southeastern states. (credit: modification of work by
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

      Signs and symptoms of RMSF include a high fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and vomiting. A petechial rash
      (similar in appearance to measles) begins on the hands and wrists, and spreads to the trunk, face, and extremities
      (Figure 25.13). If untreated, RMSF is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first 8 days even in otherwise healthy
      patients. Ideally, treatment should begin before petechiae develop, because this is a sign of progression to severe
      disease; however, the rash usually does not appear until day 6 or later after onset of symptoms and only occurs in
      35%-60% of patients with the infection. Increased vascular permeability associated with petechiae formation can
      result in fatality rates of 3% or greater, even in the presence of clinical support. Most deaths are due to hypotension
      and cardiac arrest or from ischemia following blood coagulation.
      Diagnosis can be challenging because the disease mimics several other diseases that are more prevalent. The
      diagnosis of RMSF is made based on symptoms, fluorescent antibody staining of a biopsy specimen from the rash,
      PCR for Rickettsia rickettsii, and acute and convalescent serologic testing. Primary treatment is doxycycline, with
      chloramphenicol as the second choice.

Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted by the bite of a hard-bodied,
black-legged Ixodes tick. I. scapularis is the biological vector transmitting B. burgdorferi in the eastern and north-
central US and I. pacificus transmits B. burgdorferi in the western US (Figure 25.15). Different species of Ixodes
ticks are responsible for B. burgdorferi transmission in Asia and Europe. In the US, Lyme disease is the most
commonly reported vectorborne illness. In 2014, it was the fifth most common Nationally Notifiable disease.24

Ixodes ticks have complex life cycles and deer, mice, and even birds can act as reservoirs. Over 2 years, the ticks
pass through four developmental stages and require a blood meal from a host at each stage. In the spring, tick eggs
hatch into six-legged larvae. These larvae do not carry B. burgdorferi initially. They may acquire the spirochete when
they take their first blood meal (typically from a mouse). The larvae then overwinter and molt into eight-legged
nymphs in the following spring. Nymphs take blood meals primarily from small rodents, but may also feed on
humans, burrowing into the skin. The feeding period can last several days to a week, and it typically takes 24 hours
for an infected nymph to transmit enough B. burgdorferi to cause infection in a human host. Nymphs ultimately
mature into male and female adult ticks, which tend to feed on larger animals like deer or, occasionally, humans.
The adults then mate and produce eggs to continue the cycle (Figure 25.14).

      The symptoms of Lyme disease follow three stages: early localized, early disseminated, and late stage. During the
      early-localized stage, approximately 70%-80%25 of cases may be characterized by a bull's-eye rash, called
      erythema migrans, at the site of the initial tick bite. The rash forms 3 to 30 days after the tick bite (7 days is the
      average) and may also be warm to the touch (Figure 25.15).26 This diagnostic sign is often overlooked if the tick bite
      occurs on the scalp or another less visible location. Other early symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as
      malaise, headache, fever, and muscle stiffness. If the patient goes untreated, the second early-disseminated stage
      of the disease occurs days to weeks later. The symptoms at this stage may include severe headache, neck stiffness,
      facial paralysis, arthritis, and carditis. The late-stage manifestations of the disease may occur years after exposure.
      Chronic inflammation causes damage that can eventually cause severe arthritis, meningitis, encephalitis, and
      altered mental states. The disease may be fatal if untreated.

      A presumptive diagnosis of Lyme disease can be made based solely on the presence of a bull's-eye rash at the site
      of infection, if it is present, in addition to other associated symptoms (Figure 25.15). In addition, indirect
      immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) labeling can be used to visualize bacteria from blood or skin biopsy specimens.
      Serological tests like ELISA can also be used to detect serum antibodies produced in response to infection. During
      the early stage of infection (about 30 days), antibacterial drugs such as amoxicillin and doxycycline are effective. In
      the later stages, penicillin G, chloramphenicol, or ceftriaxone can be given intravenously.

      FIGURE 25.15 (a) A characteristic bull's eye rash of Lyme disease forms at the site of a tick bite. (b) A darkfield micrograph shows Borrelia
      burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. (credit a: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; credit b:

      Relapsing Fever
      Borrelia spp. also can cause relapsing fever. Two of the most common species are B. recurrentis, which causes
      epidemics of louseborne relapsing fever, and B. hermsii, which causes tickborne relapsing fevers. These Borrelia
      species are transmitted by the body louse Pediculus humanus and the soft-bodied tick Ornithodoros hermsi,
      respectively. Lice acquire the spirochetes from human reservoirs, whereas ticks acquire them from rodent
      reservoirs. Spirochetes infect humans when Borrelia in the vector's saliva or excreta enter the skin rapidly as the
      vector bites.

      In both louse- and tickborne relapsing fevers, bacteremia usually occurs after the initial exposure, leading to a
      sudden high fever (39-43 °C [102.2-109.4 °F) typically accompanied by headache and muscle aches. After about 3
      days, these symptoms typically subside, only to return again after about a week. After another 3 days, the
      symptoms subside again but return a week later, and this cycle may repeat several times unless it is disrupted by
      antibiotic treatment. Immune evasion through bacterial antigenic variation is responsible for the cyclical nature of
      the symptoms in these diseases.

      The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be made by observation of spirochetes in blood, using darkfield microscopy

Trench Fever
The louseborne disease trench fever was first characterized as a specific disease during World War I, when
approximately 1 million soldiers were infected. Today, it is primarily limited to areas of the developing world where
poor sanitation and hygiene lead to infestations of lice (e.g., overpopulated urban areas and refugee camps). Trench
fever is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Bartonella quintana, which is transmitted when feces from infected
body lice, Pediculus humanus var corporis, are rubbed into the louse bite, abraded skin, or the conjunctiva. The
symptoms typically follow a 5-day course marked by a high fever, body aches, conjunctivitis, ocular pain, severe
headaches, and severe bone pain in the shins, neck, and back. Diagnosis can be made using blood cultures;
serological tests like ELISA can be used to detect antibody titers to the pathogen and PCR can also be used. The
first-line antibiotics are doxycycline, macrolide antibiotics, and ceftriaxone.

Tick Tips

Many of the diseases covered in this chapter involve arthropod vectors. Of these, ticks are probably the most
commonly encountered in the US. Adult ticks have eight legs and two body segments, the cephalothorax and the
head (Figure 25.17). They typically range from 2 mm to 4 mm in length, and feed on the blood of the host by
attaching themselves to the skin.

Unattached ticks should be removed and eliminated as soon as they are discovered. When removing a tick that has
already attached itself, keep the following guidelines in mind to reduce the chances of exposure to pathogens:

    · Use blunt tweezers to gently pull near the site of attachment until the tick releases its hold on the skin.
    · Avoid crushing the tick's body and do not handle the tick with bare fingers. This could release bacterial

        pathogens and actually increase your exposure. The tick can be killed by drowning in water or alcohol, or
        frozen if it may be needed later for identification and analysis.
    · Disinfect the area thoroughly by swabbing with an antiseptic such as isopropanol.
    · Monitor the site of the bite for rashes or other signs of infection.
1028  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

      Many ill-advised home remedies for tick removal have become popular in recent years, propagated by social media
      and pseudojournalism. Health professionals should discourage patients from resorting to any of the following
      methods, which are NOT recommended:

          · using chemicals (e.g., petroleum jelly or fingernail polish) to dislodge an attached tick, because it can cause
              the tick to release fluid, which can increase the chance of infection

          · using hot objects (matches or cigarette butts) to dislodge an attached tick
          · squeezing the tick's body with fingers or tweezers

      FIGURE 25.17 (a) This black-legged tick, also known as the deer tick, has not yet attached to the skin. (b) A notched tick extractor can be
      used for removal. (c) To remove an attached tick with fine-tipped tweezers, pull gently on the mouth parts until the tick releases its hold on
      the skin. Avoid squeezing the tick's body, because this could release pathogens and thus increase the risk of contracting Lyme disease.

        Bacterial Infections of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems

        Although the circulatory system is a closed system, bacteria can enter the bloodstream through several routes.
        Wounds, animal bites, or other breaks in the skin and mucous membranes can result in the rapid dissemination
        of bacterial pathogens throughout the body. Localized infections may also spread to the bloodstream, causing
        serious and often fatal systemic infections. Figure 25.18 and Figure 25.19 summarize the major characteristics

Viral pathogens of the circulatory system vary tremendously both in their virulence and distribution worldwide.
Some of these pathogens are practically global in their distribution. Fortunately, the most ubiquitous viruses tend to
produce the mildest forms of disease. In the majority of cases, those infected remain asymptomatic. On the other
hand, other viruses are associated with life-threatening diseases that have impacted human history.

Infectious Mononucleosis and Burkitt Lymphoma

Human herpesvirus 4, also known as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has been associated with a variety of human
diseases, such as mononucleosis and Burkitt lymphoma. Exposure to the human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4) is
widespread and nearly all people have been exposed at some time in their childhood, as evidenced by serological
tests on populations. The virus primarily resides within B lymphocytes and, like all herpes viruses, can remain
dormant in a latent state for a long time.

When uninfected young adults are exposed to EBV, they may experience infectious mononucleosis. The virus is
mainly spread through contact with body fluids (e.g., saliva, blood, and semen). The main symptoms include
pharyngitis, fever, fatigue, and lymph node swelling. Abdominal pain may also occur as a result of spleen and liver
enlargement in the second or third week of infection. The disease typically is self-limiting after about a month. The
main symptom, extreme fatigue, can continue for several months, however. Complications in immunocompetent
patients are rare but can include jaundice, anemia, and possible rupture of the spleen caused by enlargement.

In patients with malaria or HIV, Epstein-Barr virus can lead to a fast-growing malignant cancer known as Burkitt
lymphoma (Figure 25.20). This condition is a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that produces solid tumors chiefly
consisting of aberrant B cells. Burkitt lymphoma is more common in Africa, where prevalence of HIV and malaria is
high, and it more frequently afflicts children. Repeated episodes of viremia caused by reactivation of the virus are
common in immunocompromised individuals. In some patients with AIDS, EBV may induce the formation of
malignant B-cell lymphomas or oral hairy leukoplakia. Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma primarily
occurs in patients with HIV. HIV infection, similar to malaria, leads to polyclonal B-cell activation and permits poorly
controlled proliferation of EBV+ B cells, leading to the formation of lymphomas.

Infectious mononucleosis is typically diagnosed based on the initial clinical symptoms and a test for antibodies to
EBV-associated antigens. Because the disease is self-limiting, antiviral treatments are rare for mononucleosis.
Cases of Burkitt lymphoma are diagnosed from a biopsy specimen from a lymph node or tissue from a suspected
tumor. Staging of the cancer includes computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and cytologic
and histologic evaluation of biopsy specimens. Because the tumors grow so rapidly, staging studies must be
expedited and treatment must be initiated promptly. An intensive alternating regimen of cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and cytarabine (CODOX-M/IVAC) plus rituximab
results in a cure rate greater than 90% for children and adults.

      Cytomegalovirus Infections

      Also known as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5) is a virus with high infection rates in the
      human population. It is currently estimated that 50% of people in the US have been infected by the time they reach
      adulthood.27 CMV is the major cause of non-Epstein-Barr infectious mononucleosis in the general human
      population. It is also an important pathogen in immunocompromised hosts, including patients with AIDS, neonates,
      and transplant recipients. However, the vast majority of CMV infections are asymptomatic. In adults, if symptoms do
      occur, they typically include fever, fatigue, swollen glands, and pharyngitis.

      CMV can be transmitted between individuals through contact with body fluids such as saliva or urine. Common
      modes of transmission include sexual contact, nursing, blood transfusions, and organ transplants. In addition,
      pregnant people with active infections frequently pass this virus to their fetus, resulting in congenital CMV
      infections, which occur in approximately one in every 150 infants in US.28 Infants can also be infected during
      passage through the birth canal or through breast milk and saliva.

      Perinatal infections tend to be milder but can occasionally cause lung, spleen, or liver damage. Serious symptoms in
      newborns include growth retardation, jaundice, deafness, blindness, and mental retardation if the virus crosses the
      placenta during the embryonic state when the body systems are developing in utero. However, a majority
      (approximately 80%) of infected infants will never have symptoms or experience long-term problems.29 Diagnosis
      of CMV infection during pregnancy is usually achieved by serology; CMV is the "C" in prenatal TORCH screening.

      Many patients receiving blood transfusions and nearly all those receiving kidney transplants ultimately become
      infected with CMV. Approximately 60% of transplant recipients will have CMV infection and more than 20% will
      develop symptomatic disease.30 These infections may result from CMV-contaminated tissues but also may be a
      consequence of immunosuppression required for transplantation causing reactivation of prior CMV infections. The
      resulting viremia can lead to fever and leukopenia, a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the
      bloodstream. Serious consequences may include liver damage, transplant rejection, and death. For similar reasons,
      many patients with AIDS develop active CMV infections that can manifest as encephalitis or progressive retinitis
      leading to blindness.31

      Diagnosis of a localized CMV infection can be achieved through direct microscopic evaluation of tissue specimens
      stained with routine stains (e.g., Wright-Giemsa, hematoxylin and eosin, Papanicolaou) and immunohistochemical
      stains. Cells infected by CMV produce characteristic inclusions with an "owl's eye" appearance; this sign is less
      sensitive than molecular methods like PCR but more predictive of localized disease (Figure 25.21). For more severe
      CMV infection, tests such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA), indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) tests, and
      PCR, which are based on detection of CMV antigen or DNA, have a higher sensitivity and can determine viral load.
      Cultivation of the virus from saliva or urine is still the method for detecting CMV in newborn babies up to 3 weeks
      old. Ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are the first-line antiviral drugs for serious CMV infections.

Arthropod-Borne Viral Diseases

There are a number of arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, that can cause human disease. Among these are
several important hemorrhagic fevers transmitted by mosquitoes. We will discuss three that pose serious threats:
yellow fever, chikungunya fever, and dengue fever.

Yellow Fever
Yellow fever was once common in the US and caused several serious outbreaks between 1700 and 1900.32
Through vector control efforts, however, this disease has been eliminated in the US. Currently, yellow fever occurs
primarily in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa. It is caused by the yellow fever virus of the
genus Flavivirus (named for the Latin word flavus meaning yellow), which is transmitted to humans by mosquito
vectors. Sylvatic yellow fever occurs in tropical jungle regions of Africa and Central and South America, where the
virus can be transmitted from infected monkeys to humans by the mosquitoes Aedes africanus or Haemagogus spp.
In urban areas, the Aedes aegypti mosquito is mostly responsible for transmitting the virus between humans.

Most individuals infected with yellow fever virus have no illness or only mild disease. Onset of milder symptoms is
sudden, with dizziness, fever of 39-40 °C (102-104 °F), chills, headache, and myalgias. As symptoms worsen, the
face becomes flushed, and nausea, vomiting, constipation, severe fatigue, restlessness, and irritability are common.
Mild disease may resolve after 1 to 3 days. However, approximately 15% of cases progress to develop moderate to
severe yellow fever disease.33

In moderate or severe disease, the fever falls suddenly 2 to 5 days after onset, but recurs several hours or days
later. Symptoms of jaundice, petechial rash, mucosal hemorrhages, oliguria (scant urine), epigastric tenderness with
bloody vomit, confusion, and apathy also often occur for approximately 7 days of moderate to severe disease. After
more than a week, patients may have a rapid recovery and no sequelae.

In its most severe form, called malignant yellow fever, symptoms include delirium, bleeding, seizures, shock, coma,
and multiple organ failure; in some cases, death occurs. Patients with malignant yellow fever also become severely
immunocompromised, and even those in recovery may become susceptible to bacterial superinfections and
pneumonia. Of the 15% of patients who develop moderate or severe disease, up to half may die.

Diagnosis of yellow fever is often based on clinical signs and symptoms and, if applicable, the patient's travel

      history, but infection can be confirmed by culture, serologic tests, and PCR. There are no effective treatments for
      patients with yellow fever. Whenever possible, patients with yellow fever should be hospitalized for close
      observation and given supportive care. Prevention is the best method of controlling yellow fever. Use of mosquito
      netting, window screens, insect repellents, and insecticides are all effective methods of reducing exposure to
      mosquito vectors. An effective vaccine is also available, but in the US, it is only administered to those traveling to
      areas with endemic yellow fever. In West Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a Yellow Fever
      Initiative in 2006 and, since that time, significant progress has been made in combating yellow fever. More than 105

      Yellow Fever: Altering the Course of History

      Yellow fever originated in Africa and is still most prevalent there today. This disease is thought to have been
      translocated to the Americas by the slave trade in the 16th century.34 Since that time, yellow fever has been
      associated with many severe outbreaks, some of which had important impacts upon historic events.

      Yellow fever virus was once an important cause of disease in the US. In the summer of 1793, there was a serious
      outbreak in Philadelphia (then the US capitol). It is estimated that 5,000 people (10% of the city's population) died.
      All of the government officials, including George Washington, fled the city in the face of this epidemic. The disease
      only abated when autumn frosts killed the mosquito vector population.

      In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte sent an army of 40,000 to Hispaniola to suppress a slave revolution. This was seen by
      many as a part of a plan to use the Louisiana Territory as a granary as he reestablished France as a global power.
      Yellow fever, however, decimated his army and they were forced to withdraw. Abandoning his aspirations in the New
      World, Napoleon sold the Louisiana Territory to the US for $15 million in 1803.

      The most famous historic event associated with yellow fever is probably the construction of the Panama Canal. The
      French began work on the canal in the early 1880s. However, engineering problems, malaria, and yellow fever
      forced them to abandon the project. The US took over the task in 1904 and opened the canal a decade later. During
      those 10 years, yellow fever was a constant adversary. In the first few years of work, greater than 80% of the
      American workers in Panama were hospitalized with yellow fever. It was the work of Carlos Finlay and Walter Reed
      that turned the tide. Taken together, their work demonstrated that the disease was transmitted by mosquitoes.
      Vector control measures succeeded in reducing both yellow fever and malaria rates and contributed to the ultimate
      success of the project.

      Dengue Fever
      The disease dengue fever, also known as breakbone fever, is caused by four serotypes of dengue virus called
      dengue 1-4. These are Flavivirus species that are transmitted to humans by A. aegypti or A. albopictus mosquitoes.
      The disease is distributed worldwide but is predominantly located in tropical regions. The WHO estimates that 50
      million to 100 million infections occur yearly, including 500,000 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases and 22,000
      deaths, most among children.35 Dengue fever is primarily a self-limiting disease characterized by abrupt onset of
      high fever up to 40 °C (104 °F), intense headaches, rash, slight nose or gum bleeding, and extreme muscle, joint,
      and bone pain, causing patients to feel as if their bones are breaking, which is the reason this disease is also
      referred to as breakbone fever. As the body temperature returns to normal, in some patients, signs of dengue
      hemorrhagic fever may develop that include drowsiness, irritability, severe abdominal pain, severe nose or gum
      bleeding, persistent vomiting, vomiting blood, and black tarry stools, as the disease progresses to DHF or dengue
      shock syndrome (DSS). Patients who develop DHF experience circulatory system failure caused by increased blood
      vessel permeability. Patients with dengue fever can also develop DSS from vascular collapse because of the severe
      drop in blood pressure. Patients who develop DHF or DSS are at greater risk for death without prompt appropriate
      supportive treatment. About 30% of patients with severe hemorrhagic disease with poor supportive treatment die,
      but mortality can be less than 1% with experienced support.36

Diagnostic tests for dengue fever include serologic testing, ELISA, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) of blood. There are no specific treatments for dengue fever, nor is there a vaccine. Instead,
supportive clinical care is provided to treat the symptoms of the disease. The best way to limit the impact of this
viral pathogen is vector control.

Chikungunya Fever
The arboviral disease chikungunya fever is caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which is transmitted to humans
by A. aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes. Until 2013, the disease had not been reported outside of Africa, Asia,
and a few European countries; however, CHIKV has now spread to mosquito populations in North and South
America. Chikungunya fever is characterized by high fever, joint pain, rash, and blisters, with joint pain persisting for
several months. These infections are typically self-limiting and rarely fatal.

The diagnostic approach for chikungunya fever is similar to that for dengue fever. Viruses can be cultured directly
from patient serum during early infections. IFA, EIA, ELISA, PCR, and RT-PCR are available to detect CHIKV antigens
and patient antibody response to the infection. There are no specific treatments for this disease except to manage
symptoms with fluids, analgesics, and bed rest. As with most arboviruses, the best strategy for combating the
disease is vector control.

Ebola Virus Disease

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a highly contagious disease caused by species of Ebolavirus, a BSL-4 filovirus
(Figure 25.22). Transmission to humans occurs through direct contact with body fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, sweat,
urine, feces, or vomit), and indirect contact by contaminated fomites. Infected patients can easily transmit Ebola
virus to others if appropriate containment and use of personal protective equipment is not available or used.
Handling and working with patients with EVD is extremely hazardous to the general population and health-care
workers. In almost every EVD outbreak there have been Ebola infections among health-care workers. This ease of
Ebola virus transmission was recently demonstrated in the Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in
2014, in which more than 28,000 people in 10 countries were infected and more than 11,000 died.37

After infection, the initial symptoms of Ebola are unremarkable: fever, severe headache, myalgia, cough, chest pain,
and pharyngitis. As the disease progresses, patients experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Hemorrhaging begins after about 3 days, with bleeding occurring in the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and many other
sites. This often leads to delirium, stupor, and coma, accompanied by shock, multiple organ failure, and death. The
mortality rates of EVD often range from 50% to 90%.

The initial diagnosis of Ebola is difficult because the early symptoms are so similar to those of many other illnesses.
It is possible to directly detect the virus from patient samples within a few days after symptoms begin, using
antigen-capture ELISA, immunoglobulin M (IgM) ELISA, PCR, and virus isolation. There are currently no effective,
approved treatments for Ebola other than supportive care and proper isolation techniques to contain its spread.

      Hantavirus

      The genus Hantavirus consists of at least four serogroups with nine viruses causing two major clinical (sometimes
      overlapping) syndromes: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North America and hemorrhagic fever with
      renal syndrome (HFRS) in other continents. Hantaviruses are found throughout the world in wild rodents that shed
      the virus in their urine and feces. Transmission occurs between rodents and to humans through inhalation of
      aerosols of the rodent urine and feces. Hantaviruses associated with outbreaks in the US and Canada are
      transmitted by the deer mouse, white-footed mouse, or cotton rat.

      HPS begins as a nonspecific flu-like illness with headache, fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
      abdominal pain. Patients rapidly develop pulmonary edema and hypotension resulting in pneumonia, shock, and
      death, with a mortality rate of up to 50%.38 This virus can also cause HFRS, which has not been reported in the US.
      The initial symptoms of this condition include high fever, headache, chills, nausea, inflammation or redness of the
      eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms are hemorrhaging, hypotension, kidney failure, shock, and death. The mortality rate
      of HFRS can be as high as 15%.39

      ELISA, Western blot, rapid immunoblot strip assay (RIBA), and RT-PCR detect host antibodies or viral proteins
      produced during infection. Immunohistological staining may also be used to detect the presence of viral antigens.
      There are no clinical treatments other than general supportive care available for HPS infections. Patients with HFRS
      can be treated with ribavirin.40

      Human Immunodeficiency Virus

      Human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV), also called human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are retroviruses that are
      the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are two main variants of human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-1 (Figure 25.23) occurs in human populations worldwide, whereas HIV-2 is
      concentrated in West Africa. Currently, the most affected region in the world is sub-Saharan Africa, with an
      estimated 25.6 million people living with HIV in 2015.41 Sub-Saharan Africa also accounts for two-thirds of the
      global total of new HIV infections (Figure 25.24).42

                      FIGURE 25.24 This map shows the prevalence of HIV worldwide in 2015 among adults ages 15-49 years.

HIV is spread through direct contact with body fluids. Casual contact and insect vectors are not sufficient for
disease transmission; common modes of transmission include sexual contact and sharing of needles by intravenous
(IV) drug users. It generally takes many years before the effects of an HIV infection are detected. HIV infections are
not dormant during this period: virions are continually produced, and the immune system continually attempts to
clear the viral infection, while the virus persistently infects additional CD4 T cells. Over time, the CD4 T-cell
population is devastated, ultimately leading to AIDS.

When people are infected with HIV, their disease progresses through three stages based on CD4 T-cell counts and
the presence of clinical symptoms (Figure 25.25).

    · Stage 1: Acute HIV infection. Two to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, patients may experience a flu-like
        illness, which can last for a few weeks. Patients with acute HIV infection have more than 500 cells/L CD4 T
        cells and a large amount of virus in their blood. Patients are very contagious during this stage. To confirm
        acute infection, either a fourth-generation antibody-antigen test or a nucleic acid test (NAT) must be
        performed.

42 ibid.
1038  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

          · Stage 2: Clinical latency. During this period, HIV enters a period of dormancy. Patients have between 200
              and 499 cells/L CD4 T cells; HIV is still active but reproduces at low levels, and patients may not experience
              any symptoms of illness. For patients who are not taking medicine to treat HIV, this period can last a decade
              or longer. For patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, the stage may last for several decades, and those with
              low levels of the virus in their blood are much less likely to transmit HIV than those who are not virally
              suppressed. Near the end of the latent stage, the patient's viral load starts to increase and the CD4 T-cell
              count begins to decrease, leading to the development of symptoms and increased susceptibility to
              opportunistic infections.

          · Stage 3: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients are diagnosed with AIDS when their CD4 T-
              cell count drops below 200 cells/L or when they develop certain opportunistic illnesses. During this stage,
              the immune system becomes severely damaged by HIV. Common symptoms of AIDS include chills, fever,
              sweats, swollen lymph glands, weakness, and weight loss; in addition, patients often develop rare cancers
             such as Kaposi's sarcoma and opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, tuberculosis,
              cryptosporidiosis, and toxoplasmosis. This is a fatal progression that, in the terminal stages, includes wasting
              syndrome and dementia complex. Patients with AIDS have a high viral load and are highly infectious; they
              typically survive about 3 years without treatment.

      FIGURE 25.25 This graph shows the clinical progression of CD4 T cells (blue line), clinical symptoms, and viral RNA (red line) during an HIV
      infection. (credit: modification of work by Kogan M, and Rappaport J)

      The initial diagnosis of HIV is performed using a serological test for antibody production against the pathogen.
      Positive test results are confirmed by Western blot or PCR tests. It can take weeks or months for the body to
      produce antibodies in response to an infection. There are fourth-generation tests that detect HIV antibodies and
      HIV antigens that are present even before the body begins producing antibodies. Nucleic acid tests (NATs) are a
      third type of test that is relatively expensive and uncommon; NAT can detect HIV in blood and determine the viral
      load.

      As a consequence of provirus formation, it is currently not possible to eliminate HIV from an infected patient's body.
      Elimination by specific antibodies is ineffective because the virus mutates rapidly--a result of the error-prone
      reverse transcriptase and the inability to correct errors. Antiviral treatments, however, can greatly extend life
      expectancy. To combat the problem of drug resistance, combinations of antiretroviral drugs called antiretroviral
      therapy (ART), sometimes called highly active ART or combined ART, are used. There are several different targets for
      antiviral drug action (and a growing list of drugs for each of these targets). One class of drugs inhibits HIV entry;
      other classes inhibit reverse transcriptase by blocking viral RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase
      activity; and still others inhibit one of the three HIV enzymes needed to replicate inside human cells.

EYE ON ETHICS

HIV, AIDS, and Education

When the first outbreaks of AIDS in the US occurred in the early 1980s, very little was known about the disease
or its origins. Erroneously, the disease quickly became stigmatized as one associated with what became
identified as at-risk behaviors such as sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, and IV drug use, even though
mounting evidence indicated the disease was also contracted through transfusion of blood and blood products
or by fetuses of infected people. In the mid-1980s, scientists elucidated the identity of the virus, its mode of
transmission, and mechanisms of pathogenesis. Campaigns were undertaken to educate the public about how
HIV spreads to stem infection rates and encourage behavioral changes that reduced the risk for infection.
Approaches to this campaign, however, emphasized very different strategies. Some groups favored educational
programs that emphasized sexual abstinence, monogamy, heterosexuality, and "just say no to drugs." Other
groups placed an emphasis on "safe sex" in sex education programs and advocated social services programs
that passed out free condoms to anyone, including sexually active minors, and provided needle exchange
programs for IV drug users.

These are clear examples of the intersection between disease and cultural values. As a future health
professional, what is your responsibility in terms of educating patients about behaviors that put them at risk for
HIV or other diseases while possibly setting your own personal opinions aside? You will no doubt encounter
patients whose cultural and moral values differ from your own. Is it ethical for you to promote your own moral
agenda to your patients? How can you advocate for practical disease prevention while still respecting the
personal views of your patients?

Malaria

Despite more than a century of intense research and clinical advancements, malaria remains one of the most
important infectious diseases in the world today. Its widespread distribution places more than half of the world's
population in jeopardy. In 2015, the WHO estimated there were about 214 million cases of malaria worldwide,
resulting in about 438,000 deaths; about 88% of cases and 91% of deaths occurred in Africa.43 Although malaria is
not currently a major threat in the US, the possibility of its reintroduction is a concern. Malaria is caused by several
protozoan parasites in the genus Plasmodium: P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax.
Plasmodium primarily infect red blood cells and are transmitted through the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes.

Currently, P. falciparum is the most common and most lethal cause of malaria, often called falciparum malaria.
Falciparum malaria is widespread in highly populated regions of Africa and Asia, putting many people at risk for the
most severe form of the disease.

The classic signs and symptoms of malaria are cycles of extreme fever and chills. The sudden, violent symptoms of
malaria start with malaise, abrupt chills, and fever (39-41° C [102.2-105.8 °F]), rapid and faint pulse, polyuria,
headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. After 2 to 6 hours of these symptoms, the fever falls, and profuse
sweating occurs for 2 to 3 hours, followed by extreme fatigue. These symptoms are a result of Plasmodium
emerging from red blood cells synchronously, leading to simultaneous rupture of a large number of red blood cells,
resulting in damage to the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. The organ damage resulting from hemolysis
causes patients to develop sludge blood (i.e., blood in which the red blood cells agglutinate into clumps) that can
lead to lack of oxygen, necrosis of blood vessels, organ failure, and death.

In established infections, malarial cycles of fever and chills typically occur every 2 days in the disease described as
tertian malaria, which is caused by P. vivax and P. ovale. The cycles occur every 3 days in the disease described as
quartan malaria, which is caused by P. malariae. These intervals may vary among cases.

Plasmodium has a complex life cycle that includes several developmental stages alternately produced in
mosquitoes and humans (Figure 25.27). When an infected mosquito takes a blood meal, sporozoites in the
mosquito salivary gland are injected into the host's blood. These parasites circulate to the liver, where they develop
into schizonts. The schizonts then undergo schizogony, resulting in the release of many merozoites at once. The
merozoites move to the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. Inside red blood cells, merozoites develop into
trophozoites that produce more merozoites. The synchronous release of merozoites from red blood cells in the
evening leads to the symptoms of malaria.

In addition, some trophozoites alternatively develop into male and female gametocytes. The gametocytes are taken
up when the mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected individual. Sexual sporogony occurs in the gut of the
mosquito. The gametocytes fuse to form zygotes in the insect gut. The zygotes become motile and elongate into an
ookinete. This form penetrates the midgut wall and develops into an oocyst. Finally, the oocyst releases new
sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito salivary glands to complete the life cycle.

Diagnosis of malaria is by microscopic observation of developmental forms of Plasmodium in blood smears and
rapid EIA assays that detect Plasmodium antigens or enzymes (Figure 25.28). Drugs such as chloroquine,
atovaquone , artemether, and lumefantrine may be prescribed for both acute and prophylactic therapy, although

    · Why is malaria one of the most important infectious diseases?

Toxoplasmosis

The disease toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii is found in a wide variety of
birds and mammals,44 and human infections are common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
estimates that 22.5% of the population 12 years and older has been infected with T. gondii; but immunocompetent
individuals are typically asymptomatic, however.45 Domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts for the sexual
stages of T. gondii and, thus, are the main reservoirs of infection. Infected cats shed T. gondii oocysts in their feces,
and these oocysts typically spread to humans through contact with fecal matter on cats' bodies, in litter boxes, or in
garden beds where outdoor cats defecate.

T. gondii has a complex life cycle that involves multiple hosts. The T. gondii life cycle begins when unsporulated
oocysts are shed in the cat's feces. These oocysts take 1-5 days to sporulate in the environment and become
infective. Intermediate hosts in nature include birds and rodents, which become infected after ingesting soil, water,
or plant material contaminated with the infective oocysts. Once ingested, the oocysts transform into tachyzoites
that localize in the bird or rodent neural and muscle tissue, where they develop into tissue cysts. Cats may become
infected after consuming birds and rodents harboring tissue cysts. Cats and other animals may also become
infected directly by ingestion of sporulated oocysts in the environment. Interestingly, Toxoplasma infection appears
to be able to modify the host's behavior. Mice infected by Toxoplasma lose their fear of cat pheromones. As a result,
they become easier prey for cats, facilitating the transmission of the parasite to the cat definitive host46 (Figure
25.29).

Toxoplasma infections in humans are extremely common, but most infected people are asymptomatic or have
subclinical symptoms. Some studies suggest that the parasite may be able to influence the personality and
psychomotor performance of infected humans, similar to the way it modifies behavior in other mammals.47 When
symptoms do occur, they tend to be mild and similar to those of mononucleosis. However, asymptomatic
toxoplasmosis can become problematic in certain situations. Cysts can lodge in a variety of human tissues and lie
dormant for years. Reactivation of these quiescent infections can occur in immunocompromised patients following
transplantation, cancer therapy, or the development of an immune disorder such as AIDS. In patients with AIDS
who have toxoplasmosis, the immune system cannot combat the growth of T. gondii in body tissues; as a result,
these cysts can cause encephalitis, retinitis, pneumonitis, cognitive disorders, and seizures that can eventually be
fatal.

Toxoplasmosis can also pose a risk during pregnancy because tachyzoites can cross the placenta and cause serious
infections in the developing fetus. The extent of fetal damage resulting from toxoplasmosis depends on the severity
of maternal disease, the damage to the placenta, the gestational age of the fetus when infected, and the virulence of
the organism. Congenital toxoplasmosis often leads to fetal loss or premature birth and can result in damage to the
central nervous system, manifesting as mental retardation, deafness, or blindness. Consequently, pregnant people
are advised by the CDC to take particular care in preparing meat, gardening, and caring for pet cats.48 Diagnosis of
toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy is usually achieved by serology including TORCH testing (the "T" in
TORCH stands for toxoplasmosis). Diagnosis of congenital infections can also be achieved by detecting T. gondii
DNA in amniotic fluid, using molecular methods such as PCR.

      In adults, diagnosis of toxoplasmosis can include observation of tissue cysts in tissue specimens. Tissue cysts may
      be observed in Giemsa- or Wright-stained biopsy specimens, and CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar
      puncture can also be used to confirm infection (Figure 25.30).

      Preventing infection is the best first-line defense against toxoplasmosis. Preventive measures include washing
      hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, soil, or cat litter, and avoiding consumption of vegetables possibly
      contaminated with cat feces. All meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 73.9-76.7 °C (165-170 °F).

      Most immunocompetent patients do not require clinical intervention for Toxoplasma infections. However, neonates,
      pregnant people, and immunocompromised patients can be treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine--except
      during the first trimester of pregnancy, because these drugs can cause birth defects. Spiramycin has been used
      safely to reduce transmission in pregnant people with primary infection during the first trimester because it does not
      cross the placenta.

Babesiosis

Babesiosis is a rare zoonotic infectious disease caused by Babesia spp. These parasitic protozoans infect various
wild and domestic animals and can be transmitted to humans by black-legged Ixodes ticks. In humans, Babesia
infect red blood cells and replicate inside the cell until it ruptures. The Babesia released from the ruptured red blood
cell continue the growth cycle by invading other red blood cells. Patients may be asymptomatic, but those who do
have symptoms often initially experience malaise, fatigue, chills, fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. In rare
cases, particularly in asplenic (absence of the spleen) patients, the elderly, and patients with AIDS, babesiosis may
resemble falciparum malaria, with high fever, hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin or blood in urine),
jaundice, and renal failure, and the infection can be fatal. Previously acquired asymptomatic Babesia infection may
become symptomatic if a splenectomy is performed.

Diagnosis is based mainly on the microscopic observation of parasites in blood smears (Figure 25.31). Serologic and
antibody detection by IFA can also be performed and PCR-based tests are available. Many people do not require
clinical intervention for Babesia infections, however, serious infections can be cleared with a combination of
atovaquone and azithromycin or a combination of clindamycin and quinine.

      Chagas Disease

      Also called American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease is a zoonosis classified as a neglected tropical disease
      (NTD). It is caused by the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and is most commonly transmitted to animals
      and people through the feces of triatomine bugs. The triatomine bug is nicknamed the kissing bug because it
      frequently bites humans on the face or around the eyes; the insect often defecates near the bite and the infected
      fecal matter may be rubbed into the bite wound by the bitten individual (Figure 25.32). The bite itself is painless
      and, initially, many people show no signs of the disease. Alternative modes of transmission include contaminated
      blood transfusions, organ transplants from infected donors, and congenital transmission during pregnancy to a
      fetus.

      Chagas disease is endemic throughout much of Mexico, Central America, and South America, where, according to
      WHO, an estimated 6 million to 7 million people are infected.49 Currently, Chagas disease is not endemic in the US,
      even though triatomine bugs are found in the southern half of the country.

      Triatomine bugs typically are active at night, when they take blood meals by biting the faces and lips of people or
      animals as they sleep and often defecate near the site of the bite. Infection occurs when the host rubs the feces into
      their eyes, mouth, the bite wound, or another break in the skin. The protozoan then enters the blood and invades
      tissues of the heart and central nervous system, as well as macrophages and monocytes. Nonhuman reservoirs of T.
      cruzi parasites include wild animals and domesticated animals such as dogs and cats, which also act as reservoirs of
      the pathogen.50

      There are three phases of Chagas disease: acute, intermediate, and chronic. These phases can be either
      asymptomatic or life-threatening depending on the immunocompetence status of the patient.

      In acute phase disease, symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and enlarged spleen,
      liver, and lymph nodes. In addition, a localized nodule called a chagoma may form at the portal of entry, and swelling
      of the eyelids or the side of the face, called Romaña's sign, may occur near the bite wound. Symptoms of the acute
      phase may resolve spontaneously, but if untreated, the infection can persist in tissues, causing irreversible damage
      to the heart or brain. In rare cases, young children may die of myocarditis or meningoencephalitis during the acute
      phase of Chagas disease.

      Following the acute phase is a prolonged intermediate phase during which few or no parasites are found in the blood
      and most people are asymptomatic. Many patients will remain asymptomatic for life; however, decades after
      exposure, an estimated 20%-30% of infected people will develop chronic disease that can be debilitating and
      sometimes life threatening. In the chronic phase, patients may develop painful swelling of the colon, leading to
      severe twisting, constipation, and bowel obstruction; painful swelling of the esophagus, leading to dysphagia and
      malnutrition; and flaccid cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart), which can lead to heart failure and sudden death.

      Diagnosis can be confirmed through several different tests, including direct microscopic observation of
      trypanosomes in the blood, IFA, EIAs, PCR, and culturing in artificial media. In endemic regions, xenodiagnoses may
      be used; this method involves allowing uninfected kissing bugs to feed on the patient and then examining their feces
      for the presence of T. cruzi.

      The medications nifurtimox and benznidazole are effective treatments during the acute phase of Chagas disease.
      The efficacy of these drugs is much lower when the disease is in the chronic phase. Avoiding exposure to the
      pathogen through vector control is the most effective method of limiting this disease.

Leishmaniasis

Although it is classified as an NTD, leishmaniasis is relatively widespread in tropical and subtropical regions,
affecting people in more than 90 countries. It is caused by approximately 20 different species of Leishmania,
protozoan parasites that are transmitted by sand fly vectors such as Phlebotomus spp. and Lutzomyia spp. Dogs,
cats, sheep, horses, cattle rodents, and humans can all serve as reservoirs.

The Leishmania protozoan is phagocytosed by macrophages but uses virulence factors to avoid destruction within
the phagolysosome. The virulence factors inhibit the phagolysosome enzymes that would otherwise destroy the
parasite. The parasite reproduces within the macrophage, lyses it, and the progeny infect new macrophages (see
Micro Connections: When Phagocytosis Fails).

The three major clinical forms of leishmaniasis are cutaneous (oriental sore, Delhi boil, Aleppo boil), visceral (kala-
azar, Dumdum fever), and mucosal (espundia). The most common form of disease is cutaneous leishmaniasis, which
is characterized by the formation of sores at the site of the insect bite that may start out as papules or nodules
before becoming large ulcers (Figure 25.33).

It may take visceral leishmaniasis months and sometimes years to develop, leading to enlargement of the lymph
nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The damage to these body sites triggers fever, weight loss, and swelling of
the spleen and liver. It also causes a decrease in the number of red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells
(leukopenia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia), causing the patient to become immunocompromised and more
susceptible to fatal infections of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract.

The mucosal form of leishmaniasis is one of the less common forms of the disease. It causes a lesion similar to the
cutaneous form but mucosal leishmaniasis is associated with mucous membranes of the mouth, nares, or pharynx,
and can be destructive and disfiguring. Mucosal leishmaniasis occurs less frequently when the original cutaneous
(skin) infection is promptly treated.

Definitive diagnosis of leishmaniasis is made by visualizing organisms in Giemsa-stained smears, by isolating
Leishmania protozoans in cultures, or by PCR-based assays of aspirates from infected tissues. Specific DNA probes
or analysis of cultured parasites can help to distinguish Leishmania species that are causing simple cutaneous
leishmaniasis from those capable of causing mucosal leishmaniasis.
1048  25 · Circulatory and Lymphatic System Infections

      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is usually not treated. The lesions will resolve after weeks (or several months), but may
      result in scarring. Recurrence rates are low for this disease. More serious infections can be treated with
      stibogluconate (antimony gluconate), amphotericin B, and miltefosine.

      Schistosomiasis

      Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is an NTD caused by blood flukes in the genus Schistosoma that are native to the
      Caribbean, South America, Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Most human schistosomiasis cases are caused by
      Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, or S. japonicum. Schistosoma are the only trematodes that invade through
      the skin; all other trematodes infect by ingestion. WHO estimates that at least 258 million people required
      preventive treatment for schistosomiasis in 2014.51

      Infected human hosts shed Schistosoma eggs in urine and feces, which can contaminate freshwater habitats of
      snails that serve as intermediate hosts. The eggs hatch in the water, releasing miracidia, an intermediate growth
      stage of the Schistosoma that infect the snails. The miracidia mature and multiply inside the snails, transforming
      into cercariae that leave the snail and enter the water, where they can penetrate the skin of swimmers and bathers.
      The cercariae migrate through human tissue and enter the bloodstream, where they mature into adult male and
      female worms that mate and release fertilized eggs. The eggs travel through the bloodstream and penetrate various
      body sites, including the bladder or intestine, from which they are excreted in urine or stool to start the life cycle
      over again (Figure 5.22).

      A few days after infection, patients may develop a rash or itchy skin associated with the site of cercariae
      penetration. Within 1-2 months of infection, symptoms may develop, including fever, chills, cough, and myalgia, as
      eggs that are not excreted circulate through the body. After years of infection, the eggs become lodged in tissues
      and trigger inflammation and scarring that can damage the liver, central nervous system, intestine, spleen, lungs,

and bladder. This may cause abdominal pain, enlargement of the liver, blood in the urine or stool, and problems
passing urine. Increased risk for bladder cancer is also associated with chronic Schistosoma infection. In addition,
children who are repeatedly infected can develop malnutrition, anemia, and learning difficulties.

Diagnosis of schistosomiasis is made by the microscopic observation of eggs in feces or urine, intestine or bladder
tissue specimens, or serologic tests. The drug praziquantel is effective for the treatment of all schistosome
infections. Improving wastewater management and educating at-risk populations to limit exposure to contaminated
water can help control the spread of the disease.

Cercarial Dermatitis
The cercaria of some species of Schistosoma can only transform into adult worms and complete their life cycle in
animal hosts such as migratory birds and mammals. The cercaria of these worms are still capable of penetrating
human skin, but they are unable to establish a productive infection in human tissue. Still, the presence of the
cercaria in small blood vessels triggers an immune response, resulting in itchy raised bumps called cercarial
dermatitis (also known as swimmer's itch or clam digger's itch). Although it is uncomfortable, cercarial dermatitis is
typically self-limiting and rarely serious. Antihistamines and antipruritics can be used to limit inflammation and
itching, respectively.

drugs and drotrecogin- were administered to combat sepsis. However, by the seventh day of hospitalization,
Barbara experienced hepatic and renal failure and died.

Staphylococcus aureus most likely formed a biofilm on the surface of Barbara's catheter. From there, the
bacteria were chronically shed into her circulation and produced the initial clinical symptoms. The
chemotherapeutic therapies failed in large part because of the drug-resistant MRSA isolate. Virulence factors
like leukocidin and hemolysins also interfered with her immune response. Barbara's ultimate decline may have
been a consequence of the production of enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), which can initiate
toxic shock.

Venous catheters are common life-saving interventions for many patients requiring long-term administration of
medication or fluids. However, they are also common sites of bloodstream infections. The World Health
Organization estimates that there are up to 80,000 catheter-related bloodstream infections each year in the US,
resulting in about 20,000 deaths.52

26.4 Fungal and Parasitic Diseases of the Nervous System

INTRODUCTION Few diseases inspire the kind of fear that rabies does. The name is derived from the Latin word for
"madness" or "fury," most likely because animals infected with rabies may behave with uncharacteristic rage and
aggression. And while the thought of being attacked by a rabid animal is terrifying enough, the disease itself is even
more frightful. Once symptoms appear, the disease is almost always fatal, even when treated.
Rabies is an example of a neurological disease caused by an acellular pathogen. The rabies virus enters nervous
tissue shortly after transmission and makes its way to the central nervous system, where its presence leads to
changes in behavior and motor function. Well-known symptoms associated with rabid animals include foaming at
the mouth, hydrophobia (fear of water), and unusually aggressive behavior. Rabies claims tens of thousands of
human lives worldwide, mainly in Africa and Asia. Most human cases result from dog bites, although many mammal
species can become infected and transmit the disease. Human infection rates are low in the United States and many
other countries as a result of control measures in animal populations. However, rabies is not the only disease with
serious or fatal neurological effects. In this chapter, we examine the important microbial diseases of the nervous
system.

        CLINICAL FOCUS

        Part 1

        David is a 35-year-old carpenter from New Jersey. A year ago, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a chronic
        inflammatory bowel disease that has no known cause. He has been taking a prescription corticosteroid to
        manage the condition, and the drug has been highly effective in keeping his symptoms at bay. However, David
        recently fell ill and decided to visit his primary care physician. His symptoms included a fever, a persistent
        cough, and shortness of breath. His physician ordered a chest X-ray, which revealed consolidation of the right
        lung. The doctor prescribed a course of levofloxacin and told David to come back in a week if he did not feel
        better.

      The human nervous system can be divided into two interacting subsystems: the peripheral nervous system (PNS)
      and the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous
      system is an extensive network of nerves connecting the CNS to the muscles and sensory structures. The
      relationship of these systems is illustrated in Figure 26.2.

      The Central Nervous System

      The brain is the most complex and sensitive organ in the body. It is responsible for all functions of the body,
      including serving as the coordinating center for all sensations, mobility, emotions, and intellect. Protection for the
      brain is provided by the bones of the skull, which in turn are covered by the scalp, as shown in Figure 26.3. The scalp
      is composed of an outer layer of skin, which is loosely attached to the aponeurosis, a flat, broad tendon layer that
      anchors the superficial layers of the skin. The periosteum, below the aponeurosis, firmly encases the bones of the
      skull and provides protection, nutrition to the bone, and the capacity for bone repair. Below the boney layer of the
      skull are three layers of membranes called meninges that surround the brain. The relative positions of these
      meninges are shown in Figure 26.3. The meningeal layer closest to the bones of the skull is called the dura mater
      (literally meaning tough mother). Below the dura mater lies the arachnoid mater (literally spider-like mother). The
      innermost meningeal layer is a delicate membrane called the pia mater (literally tender mother). Unlike the other
      meningeal layers, the pia mater firmly adheres to the convoluted surface of the brain. Between the arachnoid mater
      and pia mater is the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space within this region is filled with cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF). This watery fluid is produced by cells of the choroid plexus--areas in each ventricle of the brain that
      consist of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding dense capillary beds. The CSF serves to deliver nutrients and remove
      waste from neural tissues.

FIGURE 26.2 The essential components of the human nervous system are shown in this illustration. The central nervous system (CNS)
consists of the brain and spinal cord. It connects to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a network of nerves that extends throughout the
body.

      The Blood-Brain Barrier
      The tissues of the CNS have extra protection in that they are not exposed to blood or the immune system in the
      same way as other tissues. The blood vessels that supply the brain with nutrients and other chemical substances lie
      on top of the pia mater. The capillaries associated with these blood vessels in the brain are less permeable than
      those in other locations in the body. The capillary endothelial cells form tight junctions that control the transfer of
      blood components to the brain. In addition, cranial capillaries have far fewer fenestra (pore-like structures that are
      sealed by a membrane) and pinocytotic vesicles than other capillaries. As a result, materials in the circulatory
      system have a very limited ability to interact with the CNS directly. This phenomenon is referred to as the blood-
      brain barrier.

      The blood-brain barrier protects the cerebrospinal fluid from contamination, and can be quite effective at excluding
      potential microbial pathogens. As a consequence of these defenses, there is no normal microbiota in the
      cerebrospinal fluid. The blood-brain barrier also inhibits the movement of many drugs into the brain, particularly
      compounds that are not lipid soluble. This has profound ramifications for treatments involving infections of the CNS,
      because it is difficult for drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier to interact with pathogens that cause infections.

      The spinal cord also has protective structures similar to those surrounding the brain. Within the bones of the
      vertebrae are meninges of dura mater (sometimes called the dural sheath), arachnoid mater, pia mater, and a blood-
      spinal cord barrier that controls the transfer of blood components from blood vessels associated with the spinal
      cord.

      To cause an infection in the CNS, pathogens must successfully breach the blood-brain barrier or blood-spinal cord
      barrier. Various pathogens employ different virulence factors and mechanisms to achieve this, but they can
      generally be grouped into four categories: intercellular (also called paracellular), transcellular, leukocyte facilitated,
      and nonhematogenous. Intercellular entry involves the use of microbial virulence factors, toxins, or inflammation-
      mediated processes to pass between the cells of the blood-brain barrier. In transcellular entry, the pathogen passes
      through the cells of the blood-brain barrier using virulence factors that allow it to adhere to and trigger uptake by
      vacuole- or receptor-mediated mechanisms. Leukocyte-facilitated entry is a Trojan-horse mechanism that occurs
      when a pathogen infects peripheral blood leukocytes to directly enter the CNS. Nonhematogenous entry allows
      pathogens to enter the brain without encountering the blood-brain barrier; it occurs when pathogens travel along
      either the olfactory or trigeminal cranial nerves that lead directly into the CNS. For example, Naegleria fowleri, the
      "brain-eating amoeba," reaches the brain after entering the body through the nasal canal and attaching to the
      olfactory nerve.

      Most medicines, such as antiretroviral therapies (ART) and anti-cancer drugs, cannot penetrate the blood-brain
      barrier to treat illness or eradicate pathogens. The brain thus becomes a reservoir for infections. For example, HIV
      eradicated elsewhere in the body can survive the brain, where it can lead to cognitive decline and also can reseed
      the infection more widely. Researchers such as Johns Hopkin's Dionna Williams studies the impact of these
      persistent infections as well as the mechanisms that enable the pathogens to cross the barrier. She has identified
      the specific proteins that allow HIV-infected monocytes to cross, and notes the role that dopamine plays in barrier
      permeability. Williams also researchers the mechanisms and impact of cocaine and opioids on the blood-brain
      barrier, which could lead to treatments for problematic substance use and potentially utilizing the drugs' barrier-
      migration mechanisms. Williams and her team have also developed an antibody capable of crossing the barrier to
      kill HIV-infected cells. The promise of this work goes far beyond HIV, because these methods could be applied to
      the wide array of diseases for which the blood-brain barrier inhibits treatment.

The Peripheral Nervous System

The PNS is formed of the nerves that connect organs, limbs, and other anatomic structures of the body to the brain
and spinal cord. Unlike the brain and spinal cord, the PNS is not protected by bone, meninges, or a blood barrier,
and, as a consequence, the nerves of the PNS are much more susceptible to injury and infection. Microbial damage
to peripheral nerves can lead to tingling or numbness known as neuropathy. These symptoms can also be produced
by trauma and noninfectious causes such as drugs or chronic diseases like diabetes.

The Cells of the Nervous System

Tissues of the PNS and CNS are formed of cells called glial cells (neuroglial cells) and neurons (nerve cells). Glial
cells assist in the organization of neurons, provide a scaffold for some aspects of neuronal function, and aid in
recovery from neural injury.

Neurons are specialized cells found throughout the nervous system that transmit signals through the nervous
system using electrochemical processes. The basic structure of a neuron is shown in Figure 26.4. The cell body (or
soma) is the metabolic center of the neuron and contains the nucleus and most of the cell's organelles. The many
finely branched extensions from the soma are called dendrites. The soma also produces an elongated extension,
called the axon, which is responsible for the transmission of electrochemical signals through elaborate ion transport
processes. Axons of some types of neurons can extend up to one meter in length in the human body. To facilitate
electrochemical signal transmission, some neurons have a myelin sheath surrounding the axon. Myelin, formed
from the cell membranes of glial cells like the Schwann cells in the PNS and oligodendrocytes in the CNS, surrounds
and insulates the axon, significantly increasing the speed of electrochemical signal transmission along the axon. The
end of an axon forms numerous branches that end in bulbs called synaptic terminals. Neurons form junctions with
other cells, such as another neuron, with which they exchange signals. The junctions, which are actually gaps
between neurons, are referred to as synapses. At each synapse, there is a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic
neuron (or other cell). The synaptic terminals of the axon of the presynaptic terminal form the synapse with the
dendrites, soma, or sometimes the axon of the postsynaptic neuron, or a part of another type of cell such as a
muscle cell. The synaptic terminals contain vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters. When the
electrochemical signal moving down the axon reaches the synapse, the vesicles fuse with the membrane, and
neurotransmitters are released, which diffuse across the synapse and bind to receptors on the membrane of the
postsynaptic cell, potentially initiating a response in that cell. That response in the postsynaptic cell might include
further propagation of an electrochemical signal to transmit information or contraction of a muscle fiber.

FIGURE 26.4 (a) A myelinated neuron is associated with oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are a type of glial cell that forms the myelin
sheath in the CNS that insulates the axon so that electrochemical nerve impulses are transferred more efficiently. (b) A synapse consists of
the axonal end of the presynaptic neuron (top) that releases neurotransmitters that cross the synaptic space (or cleft) and bind to receptors

      Meningitis and Encephalitis

      Although the skull provides the brain with an excellent defense, it can also become problematic during infections.
      Any swelling of the brain or meninges that results from inflammation can cause intracranial pressure, leading to
      severe damage of the brain tissues, which have limited space to expand within the inflexible bones of the skull. The
      term meningitis is used to describe an inflammation of the meninges. Typical symptoms can include severe
      headache, fever, photophobia (increased sensitivity to light), stiff neck, convulsions, and confusion. An inflammation
      of brain tissue is called encephalitis, and patients exhibit signs and symptoms similar to those of meningitis in
      addition to lethargy, seizures, and personality changes. When inflammation affects both the meninges and the brain
      tissue, the condition is called meningoencephalitis. All three forms of inflammation are serious and can lead to
      blindness, deafness, coma, and death.

      Meningitis and encephalitis can be caused by many different types of microbial pathogens. However, these
      conditions can also arise from noninfectious causes such as head trauma, some cancers, and certain drugs that
      trigger inflammation. To determine whether the inflammation is caused by a pathogen, a lumbar puncture is
      performed to obtain a sample of CSF. If the CSF contains increased levels of white blood cells and abnormal glucose
      and protein levels, this indicates that the inflammation is a response to an infectioninflinin.

      Guillain-Barré Syndrome

      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare condition that can be preceded by a viral or bacterial infection that results in
      an autoimmune reaction against myelinated nerve cells. The destruction of the myelin sheath around these neurons
      results in a loss of sensation and function. The first symptoms of this condition are tingling and weakness in the
      affected tissues. The symptoms intensify over a period of several weeks and can culminate in complete paralysis.
      Severe cases can be life-threatening. Infections by several different microbial pathogens, including Campylobacter
      jejuni (the most common risk factor), cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, Mycoplasma
      pneumoniae,1 and Zika virus2 have been identified as triggers for GBS. Anti-myelin antibodies from patients with
      GBS have been demonstrated to also recognize C. jejuni. It is possible that cross-reactive antibodies, antibodies that
      react with similar antigenic sites on different proteins, might be formed during an infection and may lead to this
      autoimmune response.

      GBS is solely identified by the appearance of clinical symptoms. There are no other diagnostic tests available.
      Fortunately, most cases spontaneously resolve within a few months with few permanent effects, as there is no
      available vaccine. GBS can be treated by plasmapheresis. In this procedure, the patient's plasma is filtered from
      their blood, removing autoantibodies.

26.2 Bacterial Diseases of the Nervous System

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common bacteria that can cause infections of the nervous system
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific bacterial diseases affecting the nervous system

Bacterial infections that affect the nervous system are serious and can be life-threatening. Fortunately, there are
only a few bacterial species commonly associated with neurological infections.

Bacterial Meningitis

Bacterial meningitis is one of the most serious forms of meningitis. Bacteria that cause meningitis often gain
access to the CNS through the bloodstream after trauma or as a result of the action of bacterial toxins. Bacteria may
also spread from structures in the upper respiratory tract, such as the oropharynx, nasopharynx, sinuses, and
middle ear. Patients with head wounds or cochlear implants (an electronic device placed in the inner ear) are also at
risk for developing meningitis.

Many of the bacteria that can cause meningitis are commonly found in healthy people. The most common causes of
non-neonatal bacterial meningitis are Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus
influenzae. All three of these bacterial pathogens are spread from person to person by respiratory secretions. Each
can colonize and cross through the mucous membranes of the oropharynx and nasopharynx, and enter the blood.
Once in the blood, these pathogens can disseminate throughout the body and are capable of both establishing an
infection and triggering inflammation in any body site, including the meninges (Figure 26.5). Without appropriate
systemic antibacterial therapy, the case-fatality rate can be as high as 70%, and 20% of those survivors may be left
with irreversible nerve damage or tissue destruction, resulting in hearing loss, neurologic disability, or loss of a limb.
Mortality rates are much lower (as low as 15%) in populations where appropriate therapeutic drugs and preventive
vaccines are available.3

pus under the dura mater (being retracted by the forceps) and the red hemorrhagic foci on the meninges. (credit b: modification of work by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

A variety of other bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli, are also capable of causing
meningitis. These bacteria cause infections of the arachnoid mater and CSF after spreading through the circulation
in blood or by spreading from an infection of the sinuses or nasopharynx. Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly
found in the microbiota of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract, can also cause bacterial meningitis in newborns
after transmission either before or during birth.

The profound inflammation caused by these microbes can result in early symptoms that include severe headache,
fever, confusion, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and stiff neck. Systemic inflammatory responses associated with
some types of bacterial meningitis can lead to hemorrhaging and purpuric lesions on skin, followed by even more
severe conditions that include shock, convulsions, coma, and death--in some cases, in the span of just a few hours.

1064  26 · Nervous System Infections

      Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is best confirmed by analysis of CSF obtained by a lumbar puncture. Abnormal
      levels of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) (> 10 PMNs/mm3), glucose (< 45 mg/dL), and protein (> 45 mg/dL)
      in the CSF are suggestive of bacterial meningitis.4 Characteristics of specific forms of bacterial meningitis are
      detailed in the subsections that follow.

      Meningococcal Meningitis
      Meningococcal meningitis is a serious infection caused by the gram-negative coccus N. meningitidis. In some
      cases, death can occur within a few hours of the onset of symptoms. Nonfatal cases can result in irreversible nerve
      damage, resulting in hearing loss and brain damage, or amputation of extremities because of tissue necrosis.

      Meningococcal meningitis can infect people of any age, but its prevalence is highest among infants, adolescents,
      and young adults.5 Meningococcal meningitis was once the most common cause of meningitis epidemics in human
      populations. This is still the case in a swath of sub-Saharan Africa known as the meningitis belt, but meningococcal
      meningitis epidemics have become rare in most other regions, thanks to meningococcal vaccines. However,
      outbreaks can still occur in communities, schools, colleges, prisons, and other populations where people are in
      close direct contact.

      N. meningitidis has a high affinity for mucosal membranes in the oropharynx and nasopharynx. Contact with
      respiratory secretions containing N. meningitidis is an effective mode of transmission. The pathogenicity of N.
      meningitidis is enhanced by virulence factors that contribute to the rapid progression of the disease. These include
      lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin, type IV pili for attachment to host tissues, and polysaccharide capsules that
      help the cells avoid phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing. Additional virulence factors include IgA
      protease (which breaks down IgA antibodies), the invasion factors Opa, Opc, and porin (which facilitate transcellular
      entry through the blood-brain barrier), iron-uptake factors (which strip heme units from hemoglobin in host cells
      and use them for growth), and stress proteins that protect bacteria from reactive oxygen molecules.

      A unique sign of meningococcal meningitis is the formation of a petechial rash on the skin or mucous membranes,
      characterized by tiny, red, flat, hemorrhagic lesions. This rash, which appears soon after disease onset, is a
      response to LOS endotoxin and adherence virulence factors that disrupt the endothelial cells of capillaries and small
      veins in the skin. The blood vessel disruption triggers the formation of tiny blood clots, causing blood to leak into the
      surrounding tissue. As the infection progresses, the levels of virulence factors increase, and the hemorrhagic lesions
      can increase in size as blood continues to leak into tissues. Lesions larger than 1.0 cm usually occur in patients
      developing shock, as virulence factors cause increased hemorrhage and clot formation. Sepsis, as a result of
      systemic damage from meningococcal virulence factors, can lead to rapid multiple organ failure, shock,
      disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.

      Because meningococcoal meningitis progresses so rapidly, a greater variety of clinical specimens are required for
      the timely detection of N. meningitidis. Required specimens can include blood, CSF, naso- and oropharyngeal
      swabs, urethral and endocervical swabs, petechial aspirates, and biopsies. Safety protocols for handling and
      transport of specimens suspected of containing N. meningitidis should always be followed, since cases of fatal
      meningococcal disease have occurred in healthcare workers exposed to droplets or aerosols from patient
      specimens. Prompt presumptive diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis can occur when CSF is directly evaluated by
      Gram stain, revealing extra- and intracellular gram-negative diplococci with a distinctive coffee-bean microscopic
      morphology associated with PMNs (Figure 26.6). Identification can also be made directly from CSF using latex
      agglutination and immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests specific for N. meningitidis. Species identification
      can also be performed using DNA sequence-based typing schemes for hypervariable outer membrane proteins of N.
      meningitidis, which has replaced sero(sub)typing.

      Meningococcal infections can be treated with antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are most often
      employed. However, because outcomes can be negative even with treatment, preventive vaccination is the best
      form of treatment. In 2010, countries in Africa's meningitis belt began using a new serogroup A meningococcal
      conjugate vaccine. This program has dramatically reduced the number of cases of meningococcal meningitis by
      conferring individual and herd immunity.

Twelve different capsular serotypes of N. meningitidis are known to exist. Serotypes A, B, C, W, X, and Y are the
most prevalent worldwide. The CDC recommends that children between 11-12 years of age be vaccinated with a
single dose of a quadrivalent vaccine that protects against serotypes A, C, W, and Y, with a booster at age 16.6 An
additional booster or injections of serogroup B meningococcal vaccine may be given to individuals in high-risk
settings (such as epidemic outbreaks on college campuses).

Meningitis on Campus

College students living in dorms or communal housing are at increased risk for contracting epidemic meningitis.
From 2011 to 2015, there have been at least nine meningococcal outbreaks on college campuses in the United
States. These incidents involved a total of 43 students (of whom four died).7 In spite of rapid diagnosis and
aggressive antimicrobial treatment, several of the survivors suffered from amputations or serious neurological
problems.

Prophylactic vaccination of first-year college students living in dorms is recommended by the CDC, and insurance
companies now cover meningococcal vaccination for students in college dorms. Some colleges have mandated
vaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine for certain students entering college (Figure 26.7).

      also called strep pneumo). This organism is commonly found in the microbiota of the pharynx of 30-70% of young
      children, depending on the sampling method, while S. pneumoniae can be found in fewer than 5% of healthy adults.
      Although it is often present without disease symptoms, this microbe can cross the blood-brain barrier in susceptible
      individuals. In some cases, it may also result in septicemia. Since the introduction of the Hib vaccine, S. pneumoniae
      has become the leading cause of meningitis in humans aged 2 months through adulthood.

      S. pneumoniae can be identified in CSF samples using gram-stained specimens, latex agglutination, and
      immunochromatographic RDT specific for S. pneumoniae. In gram-stained samples, S. pneumoniae appears as
      gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci (Figure 26.8). Identification of S. pneumoniae can also be achieved using
      cultures of CSF and blood, and at least 93 distinct serotypes can be identified based on the quellung reaction to
      unique capsular polysaccharides. PCR and RT-PCR assays are also available to confirm identification.

      Major virulence factors produced by S. pneumoniae include PI-1 pilin for adherence to host cells (pneumococcal
      adherence) and virulence factor B (PavB) for attachment to cells of the respiratory tract; choline-binding proteins
      (cbpA) that bind to epithelial cells and interfere with immune factors IgA and C3; and the cytoplasmic bacterial toxin
      pneumolysin that triggers an inflammatory response.

      With the emergence of drug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, pneumococcal meningitis is typically treated with
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, cefotaxime, penicillin, or other -lactam antibiotics. The two
      available pneumococcal vaccines are described in Bacterial Infections of the Respiratory Tract.

      Haemophilus influenzae Type b
      Meningitis due to H. influenzae serotype b (Hib), an encapsulated pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacilli, is now
      uncommon in most countries, because of the use of the effective Hib vaccine. Without the use of the Hib vaccine, H.
      influenzae can be the primary cause of meningitis in children 2 months thru 5 years of age. H. influenzae can be
      found in the throats of healthy individuals, including infants and young children. By five years of age, most children
      have developed immunity to this microbe. Infants older than 2 months of age, however, do not produce a sufficient
      protective antibody response and are susceptible to serious disease. The intracranial pressure caused by this
      infection leads to a 5% mortality rate and 20% incidence of deafness or brain damage in survivors.8

      H. influenzae produces at least 16 different virulence factors, including LOS, which triggers inflammation, and
      Haemophilus adhesion and penetration factor (Hap), which aids in attachment and invasion into respiratory
      epithelial cells. The bacterium also has a polysaccharide capsule that helps it avoid phagocytosis, as well as factors
      such as IgA1 protease and P2 protein that allow it to evade antibodies secreted from mucous membranes. In
      addition, factors such as hemoglobin-binding protein (Hgp) and transferrin-binding protein (Tbp) acquire iron from
      hemoglobin and transferrin, respectively, for bacterial growth.

      Preliminary diagnosis of H. influenzae infections can be made by direct PCR and a smear of CSF. Stained smears will

reveal intracellular and extracellular PMNs with small, pleomorphic, gram-negative coccobacilli or filamentous
forms that are characteristic of H. influenzae. Initial confirmation of this genus can be based on its fastidious growth
on chocolate agar. Identification is confirmed with requirements for exogenous biochemical growth cofactors NAD
and heme (by MALDI-TOF), latex agglutination, and RT-PCR.

Meningitis caused by H. influenzae is usually treated with doxycycline, fluoroquinolones, second- and third-
generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems. The best means of preventing H. influenza infection is with the use of
the Hib polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. It is recommended that all children receive this vaccine at 2, 4, and 6
months of age, with a final booster dose at 12 to 15 months of age.9

Neonatal Meningitis
S. agalactiae, Group B streptococcus (GBS), is an encapsulated gram-positive bacterium that is the most common
cause of neonatal meningitis, a term that refers to meningitis occurring in babies up to 3 months of age.10 S.
agalactiae can also cause meningitis in people of all ages and can be found in the urogenital and gastrointestinal
microbiota of about 10-30% of humans.

Neonatal infection occurs as either early onset or late-onset disease. Early onset disease is defined as occurring in
infants up to 7 days old. The infant initially becomes infected by S. agalactiae during childbirth, when the bacteria
may be transferred from the vagina during birth. Incidence of early onset neonatal meningitis can be greatly reduced
by giving intravenous antibiotics to a person giving birth.

Late-onset neonatal meningitis occurs in infants between 1 week and 3 months of age. Infants born to people with
S. agalactiae in the urogenital tract have a higher risk of late-onset menigitis, but late-onset infections can be
transmitted from several sources; often, the source of infection is unknown. Infants who are born prematurely
(before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or to people who develop a fever also have a greater risk of contracting late-onset
neonatal meningitis.

Signs and symptoms of early onset disease include temperature instability, apnea (cessation of breathing),
bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension, difficulty feeding, irritability, and limpness. When asleep, the baby may
be difficult to wake up. Symptoms of late-onset disease are more likely to include seizures, bulging fontanel (soft
spot), stiff neck, hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), and opisthotonos (rigid body with arched back
and head thrown backward).

S. agalactiae produces at least 12 virulence factors that include FbsA that attaches to host cell surface proteins,
PI-1 pili that promotes the invasion of human endothelial cells, a polysaccharide capsule that prevents the
activation of the alternative complement pathway and inhibits phagocytosis, and the toxin CAMP factor, which forms
pores in host cell membranes and binds to IgG and IgM antibodies.

Diagnosis of neonatal meningitis is often, but not uniformly, confirmed by positive results from cultures of CSF or
blood. Tests include routine culture, antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, serotyping of different capsule
types, PCR, and RT-PCR. It is typically treated with -lactam antibiotics such as intravenous penicillin or ampicillin
plus gentamicin. Even with treatment, roughly 10% mortality is seen in infected neonates.11

      Clostridium-Associated Diseases

      Species in the genus Clostridium are gram-positive, endospore-forming rods that are obligate anaerobes.
      Endospores of Clostridium spp. are widespread in nature, commonly found in soil, water, feces, sewage, and marine
      sediments. Clostridium spp. produce more types of protein exotoxins than any other bacterial genus, including two
      exotoxins with protease activity that are the most potent known biological toxins: botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and
      tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). These two toxins have lethal doses of 0.2-10 ng per kg body weight.

      BoNT can be produced by unique strains of C. butyricum, and C. baratii; however, it is primarily associated with C.
      botulinum and the condition of botulism. TeNT, which causes tetanus, is only produced by C. tetani. These powerful
      neural exotoxins are the primary virulence factors for these pathogens. The mode of action for these toxins was
      described in Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens and illustrated in Figure 15.16.

      Diagnosis of tetanus or botulism typically involves bioassays that detect the presence of BoNT and TeNT in fecal
      specimens, blood (serum), or suspect foods. In addition, both C. botulinum and C. tetani can be isolated and
      cultured using commercially available media for anaerobes. ELISA and RT-PCR tests are also available.

      Tetanus
      Tetanus is a noncommunicable disease characterized by uncontrollable muscle spasms (contractions) caused by
      the action of TeNT. It generally occurs when C. tetani infects a wound and produces TeNT, which rapidly binds to
      neural tissue, resulting in an intoxication (poisoning) of neurons. Depending on the site and extent of infection, cases
      of tetanus can be described as localized, cephalic, or generalized. Generalized tetanus that occurs in a newborn is
      called neonatal tetanus.

      Localized tetanus occurs when TeNT only affects the muscle groups close to the injury site. There is no CNS
      involvement, and the symptoms are usually mild, with localized muscle spasms caused by a dysfunction in the
      surrounding neurons. Individuals with partial immunity--especially previously vaccinated individuals who neglect to
      get the recommended booster shots--are most likely to develop localized tetanus as a result of C. tetani infecting a
      puncture wound.

      Cephalic tetanus is a rare, localized form of tetanus generally associated with wounds on the head or face. In rare
      cases, it has occurred in cases of otitis media (middle ear infection). Cephalic tetanus often results in patients
      seeing double images, because of the spasms affecting the muscles that control eye movement.

      Both localized and cephalic tetanus may progress to generalized tetanus--a much more serious condition--if TeNT is
      able to spread further into body tissues. In generalized tetanus, TeNT enters neurons of the PNS. From there, TeNT
      travels from the site of the wound, usually on an extremity of the body, retrograde (back up) to inhibitory neurons in
      the CNS. There, it prevents the release of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the neurotransmitter responsible for
      muscle relaxation. The resulting muscle spasms often first occur in the jaw muscles, leading to the characteristic
      symptom of lockjaw (inability to open the mouth). As the toxin progressively continues to block neurotransmitter
      release, other muscles become involved, resulting in uncontrollable, sudden muscle spasms that are powerful
      enough to cause tendons to rupture and bones to fracture. Spasms in the muscles in the neck, back, and legs may
      cause the body to form a rigid, stiff arch, a posture called opisthotonos (Figure 26.9). Spasms in the larynx,
      diaphragm, and muscles of the chest restrict the patient's ability to swallow and breathe, eventually leading to
      death by asphyxiation (insufficient supply of oxygen).

      Neonatal tetanus typically occurs when the stump of the umbilical cord is contaminated with spores of C. tetani
      after delivery. Although this condition is rare in the United States, neonatal tetanus is a major cause of infant
      mortality in countries that lack maternal immunization for tetanus and where birth often occurs in unsanitary
      conditions. At the end of the first week of life, infected infants become irritable, feed poorly, and develop rigidity
      with spasms. Neonatal tetanus has a very poor prognosis with a mortality rate of 70%-100%.12

      Treatment for patients with tetanus includes assisted breathing through the use of a ventilator, wound debridement,
      fluid balance, and antibiotic therapy with metronidazole or penicillin to halt the growth of C. tetani. In addition,
      patients are treated with TeNT antitoxin, preferably in the form of human immunoglobulin to neutralize nonfixed
      toxin and benzodiazepines to enhance the effect of GABA for muscle relaxation and anxiety.

A tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine is available for protection and prevention of tetanus. It is the T component of vaccines
such as DTaP, Tdap, and Td. The CDC recommends children receive doses of the DTaP vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18
months of age and another at 4-6 years of age. One dose of Td is recommended for adolescents and adults as a TT
booster every 10 years.13

Botulism
Botulism is a rare but frequently fatal illness caused by intoxication by BoNT. It can occur either as the result of an
infection by C. botulinum, in which case the bacteria produce BoNT in vivo, or as the result of a direct introduction of
BoNT into tissues.

Infection and production of BoNT in vivo can result in wound botulism, infant botulism, and adult intestinal toxemia.
Wound botulism typically occurs when C. botulinum is introduced directly into a wound after a traumatic injury, deep
puncture wound, or injection site. Infant botulism, which occurs in infants younger than 1 year of age, and adult
intestinal toxemia, which occurs in immunocompromised adults, results from ingesting C. botulinum endospores in
food. The endospores germinate in the body, resulting in the production of BoNT in the intestinal tract.

Intoxications occur when BoNT is produced outside the body and then introduced directly into the body through
food (foodborne botulism), air (inhalation botulism), or a clinical procedure (iatrogenic botulism). Foodborne
botulism, the most common of these forms, occurs when BoNT is produced in contaminated food and then ingested
along with the food (recall Case in Point: A Streak of Bad Potluck). Inhalation botulism is rare because BoNT is
unstable as an aerosol and does not occur in nature; however, it can be produced in the laboratory and was used
(unsuccessfully) as a bioweapon by terrorists in Japan in the 1990s. A few cases of accidental inhalation botulism
have also occurred. Iatrogenic botulism is also rare; it is associated with injections of BoNT used for cosmetic
purposes (see Micro Connections: Medicinal Uses of Botulinum Toxin).

When BoNT enters the bloodstream in the gastrointestinal tract, wound, or lungs, it is transferred to the
neuromuscular junctions of motor neurons where it binds irreversibly to presynaptic membranes and prevents the
release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal of motor neurons into the neuromuscular junction. The
consequence of preventing acetylcholine release is the loss of muscle activity, leading to muscle relaxation and
eventually paralysis.

If BoNT is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, early symptoms of botulism include blurred vision, drooping
eyelids, difficulty swallowing, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or possibly diarrhea. This is
followed by progressive flaccid paralysis, a gradual weakening and loss of control over the muscles. A patient's
experience can be particularly terrifying, because hearing remains normal, consciousness is not lost, and they are
fully aware of the progression of their condition. In infants, notable signs of botulism include weak cry, decreased
ability to suckle, and hypotonia (limpness of head or body). Eventually, botulism ends in death from respiratory
failure caused by the progressive paralysis of the muscles of the upper airway, diaphragm, and chest.

      Botulism is treated with an antitoxin specific for BoNT. If administered in time, the antitoxin stops the progression of
      paralysis but does not reverse it. Once the antitoxin has been administered, the patient will slowly regain
      neurological function, but this may take several weeks or months, depending on the severity of the case. During
      recovery, patients generally must remain hospitalized and receive breathing assistance through a ventilator.

      Medicinal Uses of Botulinum Toxin

      Although it is the most toxic biological material known to man, botulinum toxin is often intentionally injected into
      people to treat other conditions. Type A botulinum toxin is used cosmetically to reduce wrinkles. The injection of
      minute quantities of this toxin into the face causes the relaxation of facial muscles, thereby giving the skin a
      smoother appearance. Eyelid twitching and crossed eyes can also be treated with botulinum toxin injections. Other
      uses of this toxin include the treatment of hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). In fact, botulinum toxin can be used
      to moderate the effects of several other apparently nonmicrobial diseases involving inappropriate nerve function.
      Such diseases include cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Each of these diseases is
      characterized by a loss of control over muscle contractions; treatment with botulinum toxin serves to relax
      contracted muscles.

      Listeriosis
      Listeria monocytogenes is a nonencapsulated, nonsporulating, gram-positive rod and a foodborne pathogen that
      causes listeriosis. At-risk groups include pregnant people, neonates, the elderly, and the immunocompromised
      (recall the Clinical Focus case studies in Microbial Growth and Microbial Mechanisms of Pathogenicity). Listeriosis
      leads to meningitis in about 20% of cases, particularly neonates and patients over the age of 60. The CDC identifies
      listeriosis as the third leading cause of death due to foodborne illness, with overall mortality rates reaching 16%.14
      Listeriosis can cause also cause spontaneous abortion in pregnant people because of the pathogen's unique ability
      to cross the placenta.

      L. monocytogenes is generally introduced into food items by contamination with soil or animal manure used as
      fertilizer. Foods commonly associated with listeriosis include fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen vegetables,
      processed meats, soft cheeses, and raw milk.15 Unlike most other foodborne pathogens, Listeria is able to grow at
      temperatures between 0 °C and 50 °C, and can therefore continue to grow, even in refrigerated foods.

      Ingestion of contaminated food leads initially to infection of the gastrointestinal tract. However, L. monocytogenes
      produces several unique virulence factors that allow it to cross the intestinal barrier and spread to other body
      systems. Surface proteins called internalins (InlA and InlB) help L. monocytogenes invade nonphagocytic cells and
      tissues, penetrating the intestinal wall and becoming disseminating through the circulatory and lymphatic systems.
      Internalins also enable L. monocytogenes to breach other important barriers, including the blood-brain barrier and
      the placenta. Within tissues, L. monocytogenes uses other proteins called listeriolysin O and ActA to facilitate
      intercellular movement, allowing the infection to spread from cell to cell (Figure 26.10).

      L. monocytogenes is usually identified by cultivation of samples from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or CSF).
      Recovery of viable organisms can be enhanced using cold enrichment by incubating samples in a broth at 4 °C for a
      week or more. Distinguishing types and subtypes of L. monocytogenes--an important step for diagnosis and

Hansen's Disease (Leprosy)

Hansen's disease (also known as leprosy) is caused by a long, thin, filamentous rod-shaped bacterium
Mycobacterium leprae, an obligate intracellular pathogen. M. leprae is classified as gram-positive bacteria, but it is
best visualized microscopically with an acid-fast stain and is generally referred to as an acid-fast bacterium.
Hansen's disease affects the PNS, leading to permanent damage and loss of appendages or other body parts.

Hansen's disease is communicable but not highly contagious; approximately 95% of the human population cannot
be easily infected because they have a natural immunity to M. leprae. Person-to-person transmission occurs by
inhalation into nasal mucosa or prolonged and repeated contact with infected skin. Armadillos, one of only five
mammals susceptible to Hansen's disease, have also been implicated in transmission of some cases.16

In the human body, M. leprae grows best at the cooler temperatures found in peripheral tissues like the nose, toes,
fingers, and ears. Some of the virulence factors that contribute to M. leprae's pathogenicity are located on the
capsule and cell wall of the bacterium. These virulence factors enable it to bind to and invade Schwann cells,
resulting in progressive demyelination that gradually destroys neurons of the PNS. The loss of neuronal function
leads to hypoesthesia (numbness) in infected lesions. M. leprae is readily phagocytized by macrophages but is able
to survive within macrophages in part by neutralizing reactive oxygen species produced in the oxidative burst of the
phagolysosome. Like L. monocytogenes, M. leprae also can move directly between macrophages to avoid clearance
by immune factors.

1072  26 · Nervous System Infections

      The extent of the disease is related to the immune response of the patient. Initial symptoms may not appear for as
      long as 2 to 5 years after infection. These often begin with small, blanched, numb areas of the skin. In most
      individuals, these will resolve spontaneously, but some cases may progress to a more serious form of the disease.
      Tuberculoid (paucibacillary) Hansen's disease is marked by the presence of relatively few (three or less) flat,
      blanched skin lesions with small nodules at the edges and few bacteria present in the lesion. Although these lesions
      can persist for years or decades, the bacteria are held in check by an effective immune response including cell-
      mediated cytotoxicity. Individuals who are unable to contain the infection may later develop lepromatous
      (multibacillary) Hansen's disease. This is a progressive form of the disease characterized by nodules filled with acid-
      fast bacilli and macrophages. Impaired function of infected Schwann cells leads to peripheral nerve damage,
      resulting in sensory loss that leads to ulcers, deformities, and fractures. Damage to the ulnar nerve (in the wrist) by
      M. leprae is one of the most common causes of crippling of the hand. In some cases, chronic tissue damage can
      ultimately lead to loss of fingers or toes. When mucosal tissues are also involved, disfiguring lesions of the nose and
      face can also occur (Figure 26.11).

      Hansen's disease is diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, and confirmed by the
      presence of acid-fast bacilli on skin smears or in skin biopsy specimens (Figure 26.11). M. leprae does not grow in
      vitro on any known laboratory media, but it can be identified by culturing in vivo in the footpads of laboratory mice or
      armadillos. Where needed, PCR and genotyping of M. leprae DNA in infected human tissue may be performed for
      diagnosis and epidemiology. Chemist Alice Ball, at the relatively young age of 23, developed the first effective
      method for treating Hansen's disease. Oil from the chaulmoogra tree had been shown to impact the disease, but the
      substance was extremely thick and viscous, rendering it unusable as an injectable treatment. Ball recognized that
      the oil's ester compounds were critical to counteracting the bacteria, so she created a method to isolate the esters
      using alcohol, and after further manipulation created a water soluble version. Ball unfortunately passed away a year
      later, and the university president fraudulently published her work as his own; however, a local surgeon who had
      collaborated with Ball repudiated those claims. The "Ball Method" was used to create the first widely effective
      treatments, and the chaulmoogra-based medicine was the primary global treatment for leprosy until sulfone
      therapies were developed in the 1940s.

      Hansen's disease responds well to treatment and, if diagnosed and treated early, does not cause disability. In the
      United States, most patients with Hansen's disease are treated in ambulatory care clinics in major cities by the
      National Hansen's Disease program, the only institution in the United States exclusively devoted to Hansen's
      disease. Since 1995, WHO has made multidrug therapy for Hansen's disease available free of charge to all patients
      worldwide. As a result, global prevalence of Hansen's disease has declined from about 5.2 million cases in 1985 to
      roughly 176,000 in 2014.17 Multidrug therapy consists of dapsone and rifampicin for all patients and a third drug,
      clofazimin, for patients with multibacillary disease.

      Currently, there is no universally accepted vaccine for Hansen's disease. India and Brazil use a tuberculosis vaccine
      against Hansen's disease because both diseases are caused by species of Mycobacterium. The effectiveness of this
      method is questionable, however, since it appears that the vaccine works in some populations but not in others.

EYE ON ETHICS

Leper Colonies

Disfiguring, deadly diseases like leprosy have historically been stigmatized in many cultures. Before leprosy was
understood, victims were often isolated in leper colonies, a practice mentioned frequently in ancient texts,
including the Bible. But leper colonies are not just an artifact of the ancient world. In Hawaii, a leper colony
established in the late nineteenth century persisted until the mid-twentieth century, its residents forced to live
in deplorable conditions.18 Although leprosy is a communicable disease, it is not considered contagious (easily
communicable), and it certainly does not pose enough of a threat to justify the permanent isolation of its victims.
Today, we reserve the practices of isolation and quarantine to patients with more dangerous diseases, such as
Ebola or multiple-drug-resistant bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus. The
ethical argument for this practice is that isolating infected patients is necessary to prevent the transmission and
spread of highly contagious diseases--even when it goes against the wishes of the patient.

Of course, it is much easier to justify the practice of temporary, clinical quarantining than permanent social
segregation, as occurred in leper colonies. In the 1980s, there were calls by some groups to establish camps for
people infected with AIDS. Although this idea was never actually implemented, it begs the question--where do
we draw the line? Are permanent isolation camps or colonies ever medically or socially justifiable? Suppose
there were an outbreak of a fatal, contagious disease for which there is no treatment. Would it be justifiable to
impose social isolation on those afflicted with the disease? How would we balance the rights of the infected with
the risk they pose to others? To what extent should society expect individuals to put their own health at risk for
the sake of treating others humanely?

Bacterial Infections of the Nervous System

Despite the formidable defenses protecting the nervous system, a number of bacterial pathogens are known to
cause serious infections of the CNS or PNS. Unfortunately, these infections are often serious and life
threatening. Figure 26.12 summarizes some important infections of the nervous system.

A number of different viruses and subviral particles can cause diseases that affect the nervous system. Viral
diseases tend to be more common than bacterial infections of the nervous system today. Fortunately, viral infections
are generally milder than their bacterial counterparts and often spontaneously resolve. Some of the more important
acellular pathogens of the nervous system are described in this section.

Viral Meningitis

Although it is much more common than bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis is typically less severe. Many different
viruses can lead to meningitis as a sequela of the primary infection, including those that cause herpes, influenza,
measles, and mumps. Most cases of viral meningitis spontaneously resolve, but severe cases do occur.

Arboviral Encephalitis
Several types of insect-borne viruses can cause encephalitis. Collectively, these viruses are referred to as
arboviruses (because they are arthropod-borne), and the diseases they cause are described as arboviral
encephalitis. Most arboviruses are endemic to specific geographical regions. Arborviral encephalitis diseases found
in the United States include eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), St. Louis
encephalitis, and West Nile encephalitis (WNE). Expansion of arboviruses beyond their endemic regions sometimes
occurs, generally as a result of environmental changes that are favorable to the virus or its vector. Increased travel
of infected humans, animals, or vectors has also allowed arboviruses to spread into new regions.

In most cases, arboviral infections are asymptomatic or lead to a mild disease. However, when symptoms do occur,
they include high fever, chills, headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, and restlessness. In elderly patients, severe arboviral
encephalitis can rapidly lead to convulsions, coma, and death.

Mosquitoes are the most common biological vectors for arboviruses, which tend to be enveloped ssRNA viruses.
Thus, prevention of arboviral infections is best achieved by avoiding mosquitoes--using insect repellent, wearing
long pants and sleeves, sleeping in well-screened rooms, using bed nets, etc.

Diagnosis of arboviral encephalitis is based on clinical symptoms and serologic testing of serum or CSF. There are no
antiviral drugs to treat any of these arboviral diseases, so treatment consists of supportive care and management of
symptoms.

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is caused by eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), which can cause severe
disease in horses and humans. Birds are reservoirs for EEEV with accidental transmission to horses and humans by
Aedes, Coquillettidia, and Culex species of mosquitoes. Neither horses nor humans serve as reservoirs. EEE is most
common in US Gulf Coast and Atlantic states. EEE is one of the more severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the
United States, but fortunately, it is a very rare disease in the United States (Figure 26.13).19 20

Western equine encephalitis (WEE) is caused by western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). WEEV is usually
transmitted to horses and humans by the Culex tarsalis mosquitoes and, in the past decade, has caused very few
cases of encephalitis in humans in the United States. In humans, WEE symptoms are less severe than EEE and
include fever, chills, and vomiting, with a mortality rate of 3-4%. Like EEEV, birds are the natural reservoir for WEEV.
Periodically, for indeterminate reasons, epidemics in human cases have occurred in North America in the past. The
largest on record was in 1941, with more than 3400 cases.21

      St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), caused by St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), is a rare form of encephalitis with
      symptoms occurring in fewer than 1% of infected patients. The natural reservoirs for SLEV are birds. SLEV is most
      often found in the Ohio-Mississippi River basin of the central United States and was named after a severe outbreak
      in Missouri in 1934. The worst outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis occurred in 1975, with over 2000 cases
      reported.22 Humans become infected when bitten by C. tarsalis, C. quinquefasciatus, or C. pipiens mosquitoes
      carrying SLEV. Most patients are asymptomatic, but in a small number of individuals, symptoms range from mild flu-
      like syndromes to fatal encephalitis. The overall mortality rate for symptomatic patients is 5-15%.23

      Japanese encephalitis, caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable
      encephalitis in humans and is endemic to some of the most populous countries in the world, including China, India,
      Japan, and all of Southeast Asia. JEV is transmitted to humans by Culex mosquitoes, usually the species C.
      tritaeniorhynchus. The biological reservoirs for JEV include pigs and wading birds. Most patients with JEV infections
      are asymptomatic, with symptoms occurring in fewer than 1% of infected individuals. However, about 25% of those
      who do develop encephalitis die, and among those who recover, 30-50% have psychiatric, neurologic, or cognitive
      impairment.24 Fortunately, there is an effective vaccine that can prevent infection with JEV. The CDC recommends

      As the name suggests, West Nile virus (WNV) and its associated disease, West Nile encephalitis (WNE), did not
      originate in North America. Until 1999, it was endemic in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia; however, the first US
      cases were identified in New York in 1999, and by 2004, the virus had spread across the entire continental United
      States. Over 35,000 cases, including 1400 deaths, were confirmed in the five-year period between 1999 and 2004.
      WNV infection remains reportable to the CDC.

      WNV is transmitted to humans by Culex mosquitoes from its natural reservoir, infected birds, with 70-80% of
      infected patients experiencing no symptoms. Most symptomatic cases involve only mild, flu-like symptoms, but
      fewer than 1% of infected people develop severe and sometimes fatal encephalitis or meningitis. The mortality rate
      in WNV patients who develop neurological disease is about 10%. More information about West Nile virus can be
      found in Modes of Disease Transmission.

  Part 2

  Levofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic that is often prescribed to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory tract,
  including pneumonia and bronchitis. But after taking the medication for a week, David returned to his physician
  sicker than before. He claimed that the antibiotic had no effect on his earlier symptoms. In addition, he now was
  experiencing headaches, a stiff neck, and difficulty focusing at work. He also showed the doctor a rash that had
  developed on his arms over the past week. His doctor, more concerned now, began to ask about David's
  activities over the past two weeks.

  David explained that he had been recently working on a project to disassemble an old barn. His doctor collected
  sputum samples and scrapings from David's rash for cultures. A spinal tap was also performed to examine
  David's CSF. Microscopic examination of his CSF revealed encapsulated yeast cells. Based on this result, the
  doctor prescribed a new antimicrobial therapy using amphotericin B and flucytosine.

Zika Virus Infection

Zika virus infection is an emerging arboviral disease associated with human illness in Africa, Southeast Asia, and
South and Central America; however, its range is expanding as a result of the widespread range of its mosquito
vector. The first cases originating in the United States were reported in 2016.The Zika virus was initially described in
1947 from monkeys in the Zika Forest of Uganda through a network that monitored yellow fever. It was not
considered a serious human pathogen until the first large-scale outbreaks occurred in Micronesia in 2007;25
however, the virus has gained notoriety over the past decade, as it has emerged as a cause of symptoms similar to
other arboviral infections that include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and
headache. Mosquitoes of the Aedes genus are the primary vectors, although the virus can also be transmitted
sexually, to a fetus during pregnancy, or through a blood transfusion.

Most Zika virus infections result in mild symptoms such as fever, a slight rash, or conjunctivitis. However, infections
in pregnant people can adversely affect the developing fetus. Reports in 2015 indicate fetal infections can result in
brain damage, including a serious birth defect called microcephaly, in which the infant is born with an abnormally
small head (Figure 26.14).26

Diagnosis of Zika is primarily based on clinical symptoms. However, the FDA recently authorized the use of a Zika
virus RNA assay, Trioplex RT-PCR, and Zika MAC-ELISA to test patient blood and urine to confirm Zika virus disease.
There are currently no antiviral treatments or vaccines for Zika virus, and treatment is limited to supportive care.

      Rabies

      Rabies is a deadly zoonotic disease that has been known since antiquity. The disease is caused by rabies virus (RV),
      a member of the family Rhabdoviridae, and is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected mammal.
      Rhabdoviridae are enveloped RNA viruses that have a distinctive bullet shape (Figure 26.15); they were first studied
      by Louis Pasteur, who obtained rabies virus from rabid dogs and cultivated the virus in rabbits. He successfully
      prepared a rabies vaccine using dried nerve tissues from infected animals. This vaccine was used to first treat an
      infected human in 1885.

      The most common reservoirs in the United States are wild animals such as raccoons (30.2% of all animal cases
      during 2014), bats (29.1%), skunks (26.3%), and foxes (4.1%); collectively, these animals were responsible for a
      total of 92.6% of animal rabies cases in the United States in 2014. The remaining 7.4% of cases that year were in
      domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, horses, mules, sheep, goats, and llamas.27 While there are typically only
      one or two human cases per year in the United States, rabies still causes tens of thousands of human deaths per
      year worldwide, primarily in Asia and Africa.

      The low incidence of rabies in the United States is primarily a result of the widespread vaccination of dogs and cats.
      An oral vaccine is also used to protect wild animals, such as raccoons and foxes, from infection. Oral vaccine
      programs tend to focus on geographic areas where rabies is endemic.28 The oral vaccine is usually delivered in a
      package of bait that is dropped by airplane, although baiting in urban areas is done by hand to maximize safety.29
      Many countries require a quarantine or proof of rabies vaccination for domestic pets being brought into the country.
      These procedures are especially strict in island nations where rabies infections are rare, such as Australia.

      The incubation period for rabies can be lengthy, ranging from several weeks or months to over a year. As the virus
      replicates, it moves from the site of the bite into motor and sensory axons of peripheral nerves and spreads from
      nerve to nerve using a process called retrograde transport, eventually making its way to the CNS through the spinal
      ganglia. Once rabies virus reaches the brain, the infection leads to encephalitis caused by the disruption of normal
      neurotransmitter function, resulting in the symptoms associated with rabies. The virions act in the synaptic spaces

as competitors with a variety of neurotransmitters for acetylcholine, GABA, and glycine receptors. Thus, the action
of rabies virus is neurotoxic rather than cytotoxic. After the rabies virus infects the brain, it can continue to spread
through other neuronal pathways, traveling out of the CNS to tissues such as the salivary glands, where the virus can
be released. As a result, as the disease progresses the virus can be found in many other tissues, including the
salivary glands, taste buds, nasal cavity, and tears.

The early symptoms of rabies include discomfort at the site of the bite, fever, and headache. Once the virus reaches
the brain and later symptoms appear, the disease is always fatal. Terminal rabies cases can end in one of two ways:
either furious or paralytic rabies. Individuals with furious rabies become very agitated and hyperactive. Hydrophobia
(a fear of water) is common in patients with furious rabies, which is caused by muscular spasms in the throat when
swallowing or thinking about water. Excess salivation and a desire to bite can lead to foaming of the mouth. These
behaviors serve to enhance the likelihood of viral transmission, although contact with infected secretions like saliva
or tears alone is sufficient for infection. The disease culminates after just a few days with terror and confusion,
followed by cardiovascular and respiratory arrest. In contrast, individuals with paralytic rabies generally follow a
longer course of disease. The muscles at the site of infection become paralyzed. Over a period of time, the paralysis
slowly spreads throughout the body. This paralytic form of disease culminates in coma and death.

Before present-day diagnostic methods were available, rabies diagnosis was made using a clinical case history and
histopathological examination of biopsy or autopsy tissues, looking for the presence of Negri bodies. We now know
these histologic changes cannot be used to confirm a rabies diagnosis. There are no tests that can detect rabies
virus in humans at the time of the bite or shortly thereafter. Once the virus has begun to replicate (but before clinical
symptoms occur), the virus can be detected using an immunofluorescence test on cutaneous nerves found at the
base of hair follicles. Saliva can also be tested for viral genetic material by reverse transcription followed by
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Even when these tests are performed, most suspected infections are treated
as positive in the absence of contravening evidence. It is better that patients undergo unnecessary therapy because
of a false-positive result, rather than die as the result of a false-negative result.

Human rabies infections are treated by immunization with multiple doses of an attenuated vaccine to develop active
immunity in the patient (see the Clinical Focus feature in the chapter on Acellular Pathogens). Vaccination of an
already-infected individual has the potential to work because of the slow progress of the disease, which allows time
for the patient's immune system to develop antibodies against the virus. Patients may also be treated with human
rabies immune globulin (antibodies to the rabies virus) to encourage passive immunity. These antibodies will
neutralize any free viral particles. Although the rabies infection progresses slowly in peripheral tissues, patients are
not normally able to mount a protective immune response on their own.

      Poliomyelitis

      Poliomyelitis (polio), caused by poliovirus, is a primarily intestinal disease that, in a small percentage of cases,
      proceeds to the nervous system, causing paralysis and, potentially, death. Poliovirus is highly contagious, with
      transmission occurring by the fecal-oral route or by aerosol or droplet transmission. Approximately 72% of all
      poliovirus infections are asymptomatic; another 25% result only in mild intestinal disease, producing nausea, fever,
      and headache.30 However, even in the absence of symptoms, patients infected with the virus can shed it in feces
      and oral secretions, potentially transmitting the virus to others. In about one case in every 200, the poliovirus
      affects cells in the CNS.31

      After it enters through the mouth, initial replication of poliovirus occurs at the site of implantation in the pharynx and
      gastrointestinal tract. As the infection progresses, poliovirus is usually present in the throat and in the stool before
      the onset of symptoms. One week after the onset of symptoms, there is less poliovirus in the throat, but for several
      weeks, poliovirus continues to be excreted in the stool. Poliovirus invades local lymphoid tissue, enters the
      bloodstream, and then may infect cells of the CNS. Replication of poliovirus in motor neurons of the anterior horn
      cells in the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex results in cell destruction and leads to flaccid paralysis. In
      severe cases, this can involve the respiratory system, leading to death. Patients with impaired respiratory function
      are treated using positive-pressure ventilation systems. In the past, patients were sometimes confined to Emerson
      respirators, also known as iron lungs (Figure 26.16).

      Direct detection of the poliovirus from the throat or feces can be achieved using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)
      or genomic sequencing to identify the genotype of the poliovirus infecting the patient. Serological tests can be used
      to determine whether the patient has been previously vaccinated. There are no therapeutic measures for polio;
      treatment is limited to various supportive measures. These include pain relievers, rest, heat therapy to ease muscle
      spasms, physical therapy and corrective braces if necessary to help with walking, and mechanical ventilation to
      assist with breathing if necessary.

      Two different vaccines were introduced in the 1950s that have led to the dramatic decrease in polio worldwide
      (Figure 26.17). The Salk vaccine is an inactivated polio virus that was first introduced in 1955. This vaccine is

delivered by intramuscular injection. The Sabin vaccine is an oral polio vaccine that contains an attenuated virus; it
was licensed for use in 1962. There are three serotypes of poliovirus that cause disease in humans; both the Salk
and the Sabin vaccines are effective against all three.

Attenuated viruses from the Sabin vaccine are shed in the feces of immunized individuals and thus have the
potential to infect nonimmunized individuals. By the late 1990s, the few polio cases originating in the United States
could be traced back to the Sabin vaccine. In these cases, mutations of the attenuated virus following vaccination
likely allowed the microbe to revert to a virulent form. For this reason, the United States switched exclusively to the
Salk vaccine in 2000. Because the Salk vaccine contains an inactivated virus, there is no risk of transmission to
others (see Vaccines). Currently four doses of the vaccine are recommended for children: at 2, 4, and 6-18 months
of age, and at 4-6 years of age.

In 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative with the goal of eradicating polio worldwide through
immunization. That goal is now close to being realized. Polio is now endemic in only a few countries, including
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, where vaccination efforts have been disrupted by military conflict or political
instability.

        MICRO CONNECTIONS

The Terror of Polio

In the years after World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union entered a period known as the Cold War.
Although there was no armed conflict, the two super powers were diplomatically and economically isolated from
each other, as represented by the so-called Iron Curtain between the Soviet Union and the rest of the world. After
1950, migration or travel outside of the Soviet Union was exceedingly difficult, and it was equally difficult for
foreigners to enter the Soviet Union. The United States also placed strict limits on Soviets entering the country.
During the Eisenhower administration, only 20 graduate students from the Soviet Union were allowed to come to
study in the United States per year.

Yet even the Iron Curtain was no match for polio. The Salk vaccine became widely available in the West in 1955, and
by the time the Sabin vaccine was ready for clinical trials, most of the susceptible population in the United States
and Canada had already been vaccinated against polio. Sabin needed to look elsewhere for study participants. At
the height of the Cold War, Mikhail Chumakov was allowed to come to the United States to study Sabin's work.
Likewise, Sabin, an American microbiologist, was allowed to travel to the Soviet Union to begin clinical trials.
Chumakov organized Soviet-based production and managed the experimental trials to test the new vaccine in the
Soviet Union. By 1959, over ten million Soviet children had been safely treated with Sabin's vaccine.
1082  26 · Nervous System Infections

      As a result of a global vaccination campaign with the Sabin vaccine, the overall incidence of polio has dropped
      dramatically. Today, polio has been nearly eliminated around the world and is only rarely seen in the United States.
      Perhaps one day soon, polio will become the third microbial disease to be eradicated from the general population
      [small pox and rinderpest (the cause of cattle plague) being the first two].

      Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies

      Acellular infectious agents called prions are responsible for a group of related diseases known as transmissible
      spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) that occurs in humans and other animals (see Viroids, Virusoids, and Prions).
      All TSEs are degenerative, fatal neurological diseases that occur when brain tissue becomes infected by prions.
      These diseases have a slow onset; symptoms may not become apparent until after an incubation period of years
      and perhaps decades, but death usually occurs within months to a few years after the first symptoms appear.

      TSEs in animals include scrapie, a disease in sheep that has been known since the 1700s, and chronic wasting
      disease, a disease of deer and elk in the United States and Canada. Mad cow disease is seen in cattle and can be
      transmitted to humans through the consumption of infected nerve tissues. Human prion diseases include
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru, a rare disease endemic to Papua New Guinea.

      Prions are infectious proteinaceous particles that are not viruses and do not contain nucleic acid. They are typically
      transmitted by exposure to and ingestion of infected nervous system tissues, tissue transplants, blood transfusions,
      or contaminated fomites. Prion proteins are normally found in a healthy brain tissue in a form called PrPC. However,
      if this protein is misfolded into a denatured form (PrPSc), it can cause disease. Although the exact function of PrPC is
      not currently understood, the protein folds into mostly alpha helices and binds copper. The rogue protein, on the
      other hand, folds predominantly into beta-pleated sheets and is resistant to proteolysis. In addition, PrPSc can
      induce PrPC to become misfolded and produce more rogue protein (Figure 26.18).

      As PrPSc accumulates, it aggregates and forms fibrils within nerve cells. These protein complexes ultimately cause
      the cells to die. As a consequence, brain tissues of infected individuals form masses of neurofibrillary tangles and
      amyloid plaques that give the brain a spongy appearance, which is why these diseases are called spongiform
      encephalopathy (Figure 6.26). Damage to brain tissue results in a variety of neurological symptoms. Most
      commonly, affected individuals suffer from memory loss, personality changes, blurred vision, uncoordinated
      movements, and insomnia. These symptoms gradually worsen over time and culminate in coma and death.

      The gold standard for diagnosing TSE is the histological examination of brain biopsies for the presence of
      characteristic amyloid plaques, vacuoles, and prion proteins. Great care must be taken by clinicians when handling
      suspected prion-infected materials to avoid becoming infected themselves. Other tissue assays search for the
      presence of the 14-3-3 protein, a marker for prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. New assays, like RT-
      QuIC (real-time quaking-induced conversion), offer new hope to effectively detect the abnormal prion proteins in
      tissues earlier in the course of infection. Prion diseases cannot be cured. However, some medications may help slow
      their progress. Medical support is focused on keeping patients as comfortable as possible despite progressive and
      debilitating symptoms.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    · Identify the most common fungi that can cause infections of the nervous system
    · Compare the major characteristics of specific fungal diseases affecting the nervous system

Fungal infections of the nervous system, called neuromycoses, are rare in healthy individuals. However,
neuromycoses can be devastating in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Several eukaryotic parasites are also
capable of infecting the nervous system of human hosts. Although relatively uncommon, these infections can also
be life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals. In this section, we will first discuss neuromycoses, followed
by parasitic infections of the nervous system.

Cryptococcocal Meningitis

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that can cause meningitis. This yeast is commonly found in soils and
is particularly associated with pigeon droppings. It has a thick capsule that serves as an important virulence factor,
inhibiting clearance by phagocytosis. Most C. neoformans cases result in subclinical respiratory infections that, in
healthy individuals, generally resolve spontaneously with no long-term consequences (see Respiratory Mycoses). In
immunocompromised patients or those with other underlying illnesses, the infection can progress to cause
meningitis and granuloma formation in brain tissues. Cryptococcus antigens can also serve to inhibit cell-mediated
immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity.

Cryptococcus can be easily cultured in the laboratory and identified based on its extensive capsule (Figure 26.20).
C. neoformans is frequently cultured from urine samples of patients with disseminated infections.

Prolonged treatment with antifungal drugs is required to treat cryptococcal infections. Combined therapy is required
with amphotericin B plus flucytosine for at least 10 weeks. Many antifungal drugs have difficulty crossing the blood-
brain barrier and have strong side effects that necessitate low doses; these factors contribute to the lengthy time of
treatment. Patients with AIDS are particularly susceptible to Cryptococcus infections because of their compromised
immune state. AIDS patients with cryptococcosis can also be treated with antifungal drugs, but they often have
relapses; lifelong doses of fluconazole may be necessary to prevent reinfection.

        infection. All were positive for C. neoformans. Serological tests of his tissues were also positive for the C.
        neoformans capsular polysaccharide antigen.
        Since C. neoformans is known to occur in bird droppings, it is likely that David had been exposed to the fungus
        while working on the barn. Despite this exposure, David's doctor explained to him that immunocompetent
        people rarely contract cryptococcal meningitis and that his immune system had likely been compromised by the
        anti-inflammatory medication he was taking to treat his Crohn's disease. However, to rule out other possible
        causes of immunodeficiency, David's doctor recommended that he be tested for HIV.
        After David tested negative for HIV, his doctor took him off the corticosteroid he was using to manage his
        Crohn's disease, replacing it with a different class of drug. After several weeks of antifungal treatments, David
        managed a full recovery.

found free-living in soils and water. It can exist in one of three forms--the infective amoebic trophozoite form, a
motile flagellate form, and a resting cyst form. PAM is a rare disease that has been associated with young and
otherwise healthy individuals. Individuals are typically infected by the amoeba while swimming in warm bodies of
freshwater such as rivers, lakes, and hot springs. The pathogenic trophozoite infects the brain by initially entering
through nasal passages to the sinuses; it then moves down olfactory nerve fibers to penetrate the submucosal
nervous plexus, invades the cribriform plate, and reaches the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space is highly
vascularized and is a route of dissemination of trophozoites to other areas of the CNS, including the brain (Figure
26.22). Inflammation and destruction of gray matter leads to severe headaches and fever. Within days, confusion
and convulsions occur and quickly progress to seizures, coma, and death. The progression can be very rapid, and
the disease is often not diagnosed until autopsy.

N. fowleri infections can be confirmed by direct observation of CSF; the amoebae can often be seen moving while
viewing a fresh CSF wet mount through a microscope. Flagellated forms can occasionally also be found in CSF. The
amoebae can be stained with several stains for identification, including Giemsa-Wright or a modified trichrome
stain. Detection of antigens with indirect immunofluorescence, or genetic analysis with PCR, can be used to confirm
an initial diagnosis. N. fowleri infections are nearly always fatal; only 3 of 138 patients with PAM in the United States
have survived.32 A new experimental drug called miltefosine shows some promise for treating these infections. This
drug is a phosphotidylcholine derivative that is thought to inhibit membrane function in N. fowleri, triggering
apoptosis and disturbance of lipid-dependent cell signaling pathways.33 When administered early in infection and
coupled with therapeutic hypothermia (lowering the body's core temperature to reduce the cerebral edema
associated with infection), this drug has been successfully used to treat primary amoebic encephalitis.

Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis

Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia species are free-living amoebae found in many bodies of fresh water. Human
infections by these amoebae are rare. However, they can cause amoebic keratitis in contact lens wearers (see
Protozoan and Helminthic Infections of the Eyes), disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients, and
granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) in severe cases. Compared to PAM, GAE tend to be subacute
infections. The microbe is thought to enter through either the nasal sinuses or breaks in the skin. It is disseminated
hematogenously and can invade the CNS. There, the infections lead to inflammation, formation of lesions, and
development of typical neurological symptoms of encephalitis (Figure 26.23). GAE is nearly always fatal.

GAE is often not diagnosed until late in the infection. Lesions caused by the infection can be detected using CT or
MRI. The live amoebae can be directly detected in CSF or tissue biopsies. Serological tests are available but
generally are not necessary to make a correct diagnosis, since the presence of the organism in CSF is definitive.
Some antifungal drugs, like fluconazole, have been used to treat acanthamoebal infections. In addition, a
combination of miltefosine and voriconazole (an inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis) has recently been used to
successfully treat GAE. Even with treatment, however, the mortality rate for patients with these infections is high.

      Human African Trypanosomiasis

      Human African trypanosomiasis (also known as African sleeping sickness) is a serious disease endemic to two
      distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by the insect-borne hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei. The
      subspecies Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense causes East African trypanosomiasis (EAT), and another subspecies,
      Trypanosoma brucei gambiense causes West African trypanosomiasis (WAT). A few hundred cases of EAT are
      currently reported each year.34 WAT is more commonly reported and tends to be a more chronic disease. Around
      7000 to 10,000 new cases of WAT are identified each year.35

      T. brucei is primarily transmitted to humans by the bite of the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.). Soon after the bite of a
      tsetse fly, a chancre forms at the site of infection. The flagellates then spread, moving into the circulatory system
      (Figure 26.24). These systemic infections result in an undulating fever, during which symptoms persist for two or
      three days with remissions of about a week between bouts. As the disease enters its final phase, the pathogens
      move from the lymphatics into the CNS. Neurological symptoms include daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and mental
      deterioration. In EAT, the disease runs its course over a span of weeks to months. In contrast, WAT often occurs over
      a span of months to years.

      Although a strong immune response is mounted against the trypanosome, it is not sufficient to eliminate the
      pathogen. Through antigenic variation, Trypanosoma can change their surface proteins into over 100 serological
      types. This variation leads to the undulating form of the initial disease. The initial septicemia caused by the infection
      leads to high fevers. As the immune system responds to the infection, the number of organisms decrease, and the
      clinical symptoms abate. However, a subpopulation of the pathogen then alters its surface coat antigens by
      antigenic variation and evades the immune response. These flagellates rapidly proliferate and cause another bout of
      disease. If untreated, these infections are usually fatal.

      Clinical symptoms can be used to recognize the early signs of African trypanosomiasis. These include the formation
      of a chancre at the site of infection and Winterbottom's sign. Winterbottom's sign refers to the enlargement of
      lymph nodes on the back of the neck--often indicative of cerebral infections. Trypanosoma can be directly observed
      in stained samples including blood, lymph, CSF, and skin biopsies of chancres from patients. Antibodies against the
      parasite are found in most patients with acute or chronic disease. Serologic testing is generally not used for
      diagnosis, however, since the microscopic detection of the parasite is sufficient. Early diagnosis is important for

treatment. Before the nervous system is involved, drugs like pentamidine (an inhibitor of nuclear metabolism) and
suramin (mechanism unclear) can be used. These drugs have fewer side effects than the drugs needed to treat the
second stage of the disease. Once the sleeping sickness phase has begun, harsher drugs including melarsoprol (an
arsenic derivative) and eflornithine can be effective. Following successful treatment, patients still need to have
follow-up examinations of their CSF for two years to detect possible relapses of the disease. The most effective
means of preventing these diseases is to control the insect vector populations.

Neurotoxoplasmosis

Toxoplasma gondii is an ubiquitous intracellular parasite that can cause neonatal infections. Cats are the definitive
host, and humans can become infected after eating infected meat or, more commonly, by ingesting oocysts shed in
the feces of cats (see Parasitic Infections of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems). T. gondii enters the circulatory
system by passing between the endothelial cells of blood vessels.36 Most cases of toxoplasmosis are
asymptomatic. However, in immunocompromised patients, neurotoxoplasmosis caused by T. gondii infections are
one of the most common causes of brain abscesses.37 The organism is able to cross the blood-brain barrier by
infecting the endothelial cells of capillaries in the brain. The parasite reproduces within these cells, a step that
appears to be necessary for entry to the brain, and then causes the endothelial cell to lyse, releasing the progeny
into brain tissues. This mechanism is quite different than the method it uses to enter the bloodstream in the first
place.38

The brain lesions associated with neurotoxoplasmosis can be detected radiographically using MRI or CAT scans
(Figure 26.25). Diagnosis can be confirmed by direct observation of the organism in CSF. RT-PCR assays can also be
used to detect T. gondii through genetic markers.

Treatment of neurotoxoplasmosis caused by T. gondii infections requires six weeks of multi-drug therapy with
pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. Long-term maintenance doses are often required to prevent
recurrence.

      Neurocysticercosis

      Cysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. When the larvae
      invade the brain and spinal cord, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. This condition affects millions of
      people worldwide and is the leading cause of adult onset epilepsy in the developing world.39
      The life cycle of T. solium is discussed in Helminthic Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Following ingestion, the
      eggs hatch in the intestine to form larvae called cysticerci. Adult tapeworms form in the small intestine and produce
      eggs that are shed in the feces. These eggs can infect other individuals through fecal contamination of food or other
      surfaces. Eggs can also hatch within the intestine of the original patient and lead to an ongoing autoinfection. The
      cystercerci, can migrate to the blood and invade many tissues in the body, including the CNS.
      Neurocysticercosis is usually diagnosed through noninvasive techniques. Epidemiological information can be used
      as an initial screen; cysticercosis is endemic in Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. Radiological imaging
      (MRI and CT scans) is the primary method used to diagnose neurocysticercosis; imaging can be used to detect the
      one- to two-centimeter cysts that form around the parasites (Figure 26.26). Elevated levels of eosinophils in the
      blood can also indicate a parasitic infection. EIA and ELISA are also used to detect antigens associated with the
      pathogen.

      both images, as indicated by the arrows. (credit: modification of work by Segamwenge IL, Kioko NP)

      The treatment for neurocysticercosis depends on the location, number, size, and stage of cysticerci present.

Antihelminthic chemotherapy includes albendazole and praziquantel. Because these drugs kill viable cysts, they
may acutely increase symptoms by provoking an inflammatory response caused by the release of Taenia cysticerci
antigens, as the cysts are destroyed by the drugs. To alleviate this response, corticosteroids that cross the blood-
brain barrier (e.g., dexamethasone) can be used to mitigate these effects. Surgical intervention may be required to
remove intraventricular cysts.

  Parasites that successfully invade the nervous system can cause a wide range of neurological signs and
  symptoms. Often, they inflict lesions that can be visualized through radiologic imaging. A number of these
  infections are fatal, but some can be treated (with varying levels of success) by antimicrobial drugs (Figure

APPENDIX A

Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry Important to
Microbiology

Like all other matter, the matter that comprises microorganisms is governed by the laws of chemistry and physics.
The chemical and physical properties of microbial pathogens--both cellular and acellular--dictate their habitat,
control their metabolic processes, and determine how they interact with the human body. This appendix provides a
review of some of the fundamental principles of chemistry and physics that are essential to an understanding of
microbiology. Many of the chapters in this text--especially Microbial Biochemistry and Microbial
Metabolism--assume that the reader already has an understanding of the concepts reviewed here.

Atomic Structure

Life is made up of matter. Matter occupies space and has mass. All matter is composed of atoms. All atoms contain
protons, electrons, and neutrons (Figure A1). The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and
one electron. A proton is a positively charged particle that resides in the nucleus (the core of the atom) of an atom
and has a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu) and a charge of +1. An electron is a negatively charged particle that
travels in the space around the nucleus. Electrons are distributed in different energy levels called electron shells.
Electrons have a negligible mass and a charge of -1. Neutrons, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They
have a mass of 1 amu and no charge (neutral). The positive (proton) and negative (electron) charges balance each
other in a neutral atom, which has a net zero charge. Because protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1 amu, the
mass of an atom is equal to the number of protons and neutrons of that atom. The number of electrons does not
factor into the overall mass because electron mass is so small.

           FIGURE A1 Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus and electrons surrounding the nucleus.

Chemical Elements

All matter is composed of atoms of elements. Elements have unique physical and chemical properties and are
substances that cannot easily be transformed either physically or chemically into other substances. Each element
has been given a name, usually derived from Latin or English. The elements also have one- or two-letter symbols
representing the name; for example, sodium (Na), gold (Au), and silver (Ag) have abbreviations derived from their
original Latin names natrium, aurum, and argentum, respectively. Examples with English abbreviations are carbon
(C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). A total of 118 different elements (92 of which occur naturally) have
been identified and organized into the periodic table of elements. Of the naturally occurring elements, fewer than 30
are found in organisms on Earth, and four of those (C, H, O, and N) make up approximately 96% of the mass of an
organism.1

1098 A · Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry Important to Microbiology

Each unique element is identified by the number of protons in its atomic nucleus. In addition to protons, each
element's atomic nucleus contains an equal or greater number of neutrons (with the exception of hydrogen, which
has only one proton). The total number of protons per element is described as the atomic number, and the
combined mass of protons and neutrons is called the atomic mass or mass number. Therefore, it is possible to
determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number.

Isotopes are different forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a different number of
neutrons. Many elements have several isotopes with one or two commonly occurring isotopes in nature. For
example, carbon-12 (12C), the most common isotope of carbon (98.6% of all C found on Earth),2 contains six
protons and six neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons) and an atomic number of
6.

There are two additional types of isotopes in nature: heavy isotopes, and radioisotopes. Heavy isotopes have one or
more extra neutrons while still maintaining a stable atomic nucleus. An example of a heavy isotope is carbon-13
(13C) (1.1% of all carbon).3 13C has a mass number of 13 (6 protons + 7 neutrons). Since the atomic number of 13C
is 6, it is still the element carbon; however, it has more mass than the more common form of the element, 12C,
because of the extra neutron in the nucleus. Carbon-14 (14C) (0.0001% of all carbon)4 is an example of a
radioisotope. 14C has a mass number of 14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons); however, the extra neutrons in 14C result in an
unstable nucleus. This instability leads to the process of radioactive decay. Radioactive decay involves the loss of
one or more neutrons and the release of energy in the form of gamma rays, alpha particles, or beta particles
(depending on the isotope).

Heavy isotopes and radioisotopes of carbon and other elements have proven to be useful in research, industry, and
medicine.

Chemical Bonds

There are three types of chemical bonds that are important when describing the interaction of atoms both within
and between molecules in microbiology: (1) covalent bonds, which can be either polar or non-polar, (2) ionic bonds,
and (3) hydrogen bonds. There are other types of interactions such as London dispersion forces and van der Waals
forces that could also be discussed when describing the physical and chemical properties of the intermolecular
interactions of atoms, but we will not include descriptions of these forces here.

Chemical bonding is determined by the outermost shell of electrons, called the valence electrons (VE), of an atom.
The number of VE is important when determining the number and type of chemical bonds an atom will form.

Covalent Bonds

The strongest chemical bond between two or more atoms is a covalent bond. These bonds form when an electron is
shared between two atoms, and these are the most common form of chemical bond in living organisms. Covalent
bonds form between the atoms of elements that make up the biological molecules in our cells. An example of a
simple molecule formed with covalent bonds is water, H2O, with one VE per H atom and 6 VE per O atom. Because
of the VE configuration, each H atom is able to accept one additional VE and each O atom is able to accept two
additional VE. When sharing electrons, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules
become bonded together by covalent bonds (Figure A2). The electron from the hydrogen atom divides its time
between the outer electron shell of the hydrogen atom and the outermost electron shell of the oxygen atom. To
completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two hydrogen atoms are needed, hence the
subscript "2" indicating two atoms of H in a molecule of H2O. This sharing is a lower energy state for all of the atoms
involved than if they existed without their outer shells filled.

There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of
the same or different elements that share the electrons equally (Figure A2). In a polar covalent bond, the electrons
shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the other nucleus. Because of the unequal

distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (+) or slightly negative (-) charge
develops. Water is an example of a molecule formed with polar covalent bonds (Figure A2).

FIGURE A2 The water molecule (top left) depicts a polar bond with a slightly positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and a slightly negative
charge on the oxygen. Methane (top right) is an example of a nonpolar covalent bond. Sodium chloride (bottom) is a substance formed from
ionic bonds between sodium and chlorine.

Ions and Ionic Bonds

When an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called an ion. Because the number of
1100 A · Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry Important to Microbiology

electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are formed by losing
electrons and are called cations. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions.

For example, a sodium atom has only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for the sodium
atom to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons, which it would need to fill its outer
shell. If the sodium atom loses an electron, it now has 11 protons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall
charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion (Na+).

A chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy efficient for the chlorine atom to gain
one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it will more likely gain an electron to form an ion with 17 protons and 18
electrons, giving it a net negative (-1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion (Cl-). This movement of electrons from
one atom to another is referred to as electron transfer. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions
stay together and form an ionic bond, or a bond between ions. When Na+ and Cl- ions combine to produce NaCl, an
electron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine atom, and the sodium and chloride ions
attract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge (Figure A2).

Polyatomic ions consist of multiple atoms joined by covalent bonds; but unlike a molecule, a polyatomic ion has a
positive or negative charge. It behaves as a cation or anion and can therefore form ionic bonds with other ions to
form ionic compounds. The atoms in a polyatomic ion may be from the same element or different elements.

Table A1 lists some cations and anions that commonly occur in microbiology. Note that this table includes
monoatomic as well as polyatomic ions.

Molecular Formula, Molecular Mass, and the Mole

For molecules formed by covalent bonds, the molecular formula represents the number and types of elemental
atoms that compose the molecule. As an example, consider a molecule of glucose, which has the molecular formula
C6H12O6. This molecular formula indicates that a single molecule of glucose is formed from six carbon atoms,
twelve hydrogen atoms, and six oxygen atoms.

The molecular mass of a molecule can be calculated using the molecular formula and the atomic mass of each
element in the molecule. The number of each type of atom is multiplied by the atomic mass; then the products are
added to get the molecular mass. For example the molecular mass of glucose, C6H12O6 (Figure A3), is calculated as:

FIGURE A3 The molecular structure of glucose showing the numbers of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. Glucose has a molecular
mass of 180 amu.

The number of entities composing a mole has been experimentally determined to be 6.022 × 1023, a fundamental
constant named Avogadro's number (NA) or the Avogadro constant. This constant is properly reported with an
explicit unit of "per mole."

Energy

Thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter.

Matter participating in a particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that matter is
called the surroundings. There are two types of systems: open and closed. In an open system, energy can be
exchanged with its surroundings. A closed system cannot exchange energy with its surroundings. Biological
organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings as they use energy from
the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by
doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to physical laws. In general,
energy is defined as the ability to do work, or to create some kind of change. Energy exists in different forms. For
example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. The first law of
thermodynamics, often referred to as the law of conservation of energy, states that the total amount of energy in
the universe is constant and conserved. Energy exists in many different forms. According to the first law of
thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot
be created or destroyed.
1102 A · Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry Important to Microbiology

The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or
transform into usable energy to do work. Microorganisms have evolved to meet this challenge. Chemical energy
stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transferred and transformed through a series of cellular
chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work.
Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials,
powering the motion of cilia or flagella, and contracting muscle fibers to create movement.

A microorganism's primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple.
However, the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are more difficult than they appear. All
energy transfers and transformations are never completely efficient. In every energy transfer, some amount of
energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, heat energy is
defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not work. For example, some energy is lost as
heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions.

The more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is.
Scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy. High entropy means high
disorder and low energy. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying entropy as well. For example, entropy
increases as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out. The second law of
thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in energy transfers or transformations. Microorganisms
are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy.

Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are
broken apart. The substances used in a chemical reaction are called the reactants (usually found on the left side of
a chemical equation), and the substances produced by the reaction are known as the products (usually found on the
right side of a chemical equation). An arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the
direction of the chemical reaction; this direction is not always a "one-way street."

An example of a simple chemical reaction is the breaking down of hydrogen peroxide molecules, each of which
consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms (H2O2). The reactant hydrogen peroxide is broken
down into water, containing one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms (H2O), and oxygen, which consists of
two bonded oxygen atoms (O2). In the equation below, the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and
two water molecules. This is an example of a balanced chemical equation, wherein the number of atoms of each
element is the same on each side of the equation. According to the law of conservation of matter, the number of
atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal, such that no atoms are, under normal circumstances,
created or destroyed.

Some chemical reactions, such as the one shown above, can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used
up. Equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible. Reversible reactions
are those that can go in either direction. In reversible reactions, reactants are turned into products, but when the
concentration of product rises above a certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these
products will be converted back into reactants; at this point, the designations of products and reactants are
reversed. The changes in concentration continue until a certain relative balance in concentration between reactants
and products occurs--a state called chemical equilibrium. At this point, both the forward and reverse reactions
continue to occur, but they do so at the same rate, so the concentrations of reactants and products do not change.
These situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double-headed arrow
pointing towards both the reactants and products. For example, when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it can do so
as a gas dissolved in water or by reacting with water to produce carbonic acid. In the cells of some microorganisms,
the rate of carbonic acid production is accelerated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, as indicated in the following
equation:

Properties of Water and Solutions

The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. There is no overall charge to a
water molecule, but there is one + on each hydrogen atom and two - on the oxygen atom. Each water molecule
attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative charges in the different parts of the molecule
(Figure A4). Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming hydrogen bonds. When a substance
readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred to as hydrophilic ("water-loving").
Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and fats. These nonpolar compounds are
hydrophobic ("water-fearing") and will orient away from and avoid water.

FIGURE A4 Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive (+) and slightly negative (-) charges of polar covalent molecules such as
water.

The hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances.
This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input
continues, the balance between hydrogen-bond formation and breaking swings toward fewer hydrogen bonds: more
bonds are broken than are formed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of
the liquid (such as a body of water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process called evaporation.
Conversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen
bonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e.g.,
ice). When frozen, ice is less dense (the molecules are farther apart) than liquid water. This means that ice floats on
the surface of a body of water. In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of the water, creating an
insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this did not happen,
plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making life in cold
temperatures difficult or impossible.
Because water is polar, with slight positive and negative charges, ionic compounds and polar molecules can readily
dissolve in it. Water is, therefore, what is referred to as a solvent--a substance capable of dissolving another
substance. The charged particles will form hydrogen bonds with a surrounding layer of water molecules. This is
referred to as a sphere of hydration and serves to keep the ions separated or dispersed in the water (Figure A5).
These spheres of hydration are also referred to as hydration shells. The polarity of the water molecule makes it an
effective solvent and is important in its many roles in living systems.
1104 A · Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry Important to Microbiology

FIGURE A5 When table salt (NaCl) is mixed in water, spheres of hydration form around the ions.

The ability of insects to float on and skate across pond water results from the property of cohesion. In cohesion,
water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the
liquid-air (gas) interface. Cohesion gives rise to surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupture
when placed under tension or stress.

These cohesive forces are also related to water's property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules
and other molecules. This is observed when water "climbs" up a straw placed in a glass of water. You will notice that
the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle. This is because the water molecules are
attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it.

Cohesion and adhesion are also factors in bacterial colonies and biofilm formation. Cohesion keeps the colony intact
(helps it "stick" to a surface), while adhesion keeps the cells adhered to each other. Cohesive and adhesive forces
are important for sustaining life. For example, because of these forces, water in natural surroundings provides the
conditions necessary to allow bacterial and archaeal cells to adhere and accumulate on surfaces.

Acids and Bases

The pH of a solution is a measure of hydrogen ion (H+) and hydroxide ion (OH-) concentrations and is described as

acidity or alkalinity, respectively. Acidity and alkalinity (also referred to as basicity) can be measured and

calculated. pH can be simply represented by the mathematic equation,      On the left side of the

equation, the "p" means "the negative logarithm of " and the H represents the [H+]. On the right side of the equation,

[H+] is the concentration of H+ in moles/L . What is not represented in this simple equation is the contribution of the
OH-, which also participates in acidity or alkalinity. Calculation of pH results in a number range of 0 to 14 called the
pH scale (Figure A6). A pH value between 0 and 6.9 indicates an acid. It is also referred to as a low pH, due to a high
[H+] and low [OH-] concentration. A pH value between 7.1 and 14 indicates an alkali or base. It is also referred to as
a high pH, due to a low [H+] and high [OH-] concentration. A pH of 7 is described as a neutral pH and occurs when
[H+] equals [OH-].

FIGURE A6 The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] and [OH-] in a substance. (credit: modification of work by
Edward Stevens)

A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the [H+] by a factor of 10, a change in two units
represents a change in the [H+] by a factor of 100. Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in [H+].

Mathematical Basics

Squares and Other Powers

An exponent, or a power, is mathematical shorthand for repeated multiplications. For example, the exponent "2"
means to multiply the base for that exponent by itself (in the example here, the base is "5"):

The exponent is "2" and the base is the number "5." This expression (multiplying a number by itself) is also called a
square. Any number raised to the power of 2 is being squared. Any number raised to the power of 3 is being cubed:

A number raised to the fourth power is equal to that number multiplied by itself four times, and so on for higher
powers. In general:

Calculating Percents

A percent is a way of expressing a fractional amount of something using a whole divided into 100 parts. A percent is
a ratio whose denominator is 100. We use the percent symbol, %, to show percent. Thus, 25% means a ratio of ,
3% means a ratio of , and 100 % percent means , or a whole.

Converting Percents

A percent can be converted to a fraction by writing the value of the percent as a fraction with a denominator of 100
and simplifying the fraction if possible.

A percent can be converted to a decimal by writing the value of the percent as a fraction with a denominator of 100
and dividing the numerator by the denominator.

To convert a decimal to a percent, write the decimal as a fraction. If the denominator of the fraction is not 100,
convert it to a fraction with a denominator of 100, and then write the fraction as a percent.

To convert a fraction to a percent, first convert the fraction to a decimal, and then convert the decimal to a percent.

Suppose a researcher finds that 15 out of 23 students in a class are carriers of Neisseria meningitides. What
percentage of students are carriers? To find this value, first express the numbers as a fraction.

Then divide the numerator by the denominator.
1108 B · Mathematical Basics

Finally, to convert a decimal to a percent, multiply by 100.
The percent of students who are carriers is 65%.
You might also get data on occurrence and non-occurrence; for example, in a sample of students, 9 tested positive
for Toxoplasma antibodies, while 28 tested negative. What is the percentage of seropositive students? The first step
is to determine the "whole," of which the positive students are a part. To do this, sum the positive and negative
tests.
The whole sample consisted of 37 students. The fraction of positives is:

To find the percent of students who are carriers, divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100.

The percent of positive students is about 24%.
Another way to think about calculating a percent is to set up equivalent fractions, one of which is a fraction with 100
as the denominator, and cross-multiply. The previous example would be expressed as:

Now, cross multiply and solve for the unknown:

The answer, rounded, is the same.

Multiplying and Dividing by Tens

In many fields, especially in the sciences, it is common to multiply decimals by powers of 10. Let's see what
happens when we multiply 1.9436 by some powers of 10.

The number of places that the decimal point moves is the same as the number of zeros in the power of ten. Table B1
summarizes the results.

1,000           3 3 places to the right

10,000          4 4 places to the right

TABLE B1

We can use this pattern as a shortcut to multiply by powers of ten instead of multiplying using the vertical format.
We can count the zeros in the power of 10 and then move the decimal point that same number of places to the right.

So, for example, to multiply 45.86 by 100, move the decimal point 2 places to the right.

Sometimes when we need to move the decimal point, there are not enough decimal places. In that case, we use
zeros as placeholders. For example, let's multiply 2.4 by 100. We need to move the decimal point 2 places to the
right. Since there is only one digit to the right of the decimal point, we must write a 0 in the hundredths place.

When dividing by powers of 10, simply take the opposite approach and move the decimal to the left by the number
of zeros in the power of ten.

Let's see what happens when we divide 1.9436 by some powers of 10.

If there are insufficient digits to move the decimal, add zeroes to create places.

Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is used to express very large and very small numbers as a product of two numbers. The first
number of the product, the digit term, is usually a number not less than 1 and not greater than 10. The second
number of the product, the exponential term, is written as 10 with an exponent. Some examples of scientific
notation are given in Table B2.

Standard Notation Scientific Notation

          0.1   1 × 10-1

          0.01  1 × 10-2

Scientific notation is particularly useful notation for very large and very small numbers, such as 1,230,000,000 =
1.23 × 109, and 0.00000000036 = 3.6 × 10-10.
1110 B · Mathematical Basics

Expressing Numbers in Scientific Notation

Converting any number to scientific notation is straightforward. Count the number of places needed to move the
decimal next to the left-most non-zero digit: that is, to make the number between 1 and 10. Then multiply that
number by 10 raised to the number of places you moved the decimal. The exponent is positive if you moved the
decimal to the left and negative if you moved the decimal to the right. So

and

The power (exponent) of 10 is equal to the number of places the decimal is shifted.

Logarithms

The common logarithm (log) of a number is the power to which 10 must be raised to equal that number. For
example, the common logarithm of 100 is 2, because 10 must be raised to the second power to equal 100.
Additional examples are in Table B3.

To find the common logarithm of most numbers, you will need to use the LOG button on a calculator.

Rounding and Significant Digits

In reporting numerical data obtained via measurements, we use only as many significant figures as the accuracy of
the measurement warrants. For example, suppose a microbiologist using an automated cell counter determines that
there are 525,341 bacterial cells in a one-liter sample of river water. However, she records the concentration as
525,000 cells per liter and uses this rounded number to estimate the number of cells that would likely be found in
10 liters of river water. In this instance, the last three digits of the measured quantity are not considered significant.
They are rounded to account for variations in the number of cells that would likely occur if more samples were
measured.

The importance of significant figures lies in their application to fundamental computation. In addition and
subtraction, the sum or difference should contain as many digits to the right of the decimal as that in the least
certain (indicated by underscoring in the following example) of the numbers used in the computation.

Suppose a microbiologist wishes to calculate the total mass of two samples of agar.

The least certain of the two masses has three decimal places, so the sum must have three decimal places.
In multiplication and division, the product or quotient should contain no more digits than than in the factor
containing the least number of significant figures. Suppose the microbiologist would like to calculate how much of a

reagent would be present in 6.6 mL if the concentration is 0.638 g/mL.

Again, the answer has only one decimal place because this is the accuracy of the least accurate number in the
calculation.

When rounding numbers, increase the retained digit by 1 if it is followed by a number larger than 5 ("round up"). Do
not change the retained digit if the digits that follow are less than 5 ("round down"). If the retained digit is followed
by 5, round up if the retained digit is odd, or round down if it is even (after rounding, the retained digit will thus
always be even).

Generation Time

It is possible to write an equation to calculate the cell numbers at any time if the number of starting cells and
doubling time are known, as long as the cells are dividing at a constant rate. We define N0 as the starting number of
bacteria, the number at time t = 0. Ni is the number of bacteria at time t = i, an arbitrary time in the future. Finally we
will set j equal to the number of generations, or the number of times the cell population doubles during the time
interval. Then we have,

This equation is an expression of growth by binary fission.

In our example, N0 = 4, the number of generations, j, is equal to 3 after 90 minutes because the generation time is
30 minutes. The number of cells can be estimated from the following equation:

The number of cells after 90 minutes is 32.

TCA Cycle

FIGURE C5 In this transition reaction, a multi-enzyme complex converts pyruvate into one acetyl (2C) group plus one carbon dioxide (CO2).
The acetyl group is attached to a Coenzyme A carrier that transports the acetyl group to the site of the Krebs cycle. In the process, one
molecule of NADH is formed.

the cycle. In the process, three NADH, one FADH2, and one ATP or GTP (depending on the cell type) is produced by substrate-level
phosphorylation. Because the final product of the citric acid cycle is also the first reactant, the cycle runs continuously in the presence of
sufficient reactants. (credit: modification of work by "Yikrazuul"/Wikimedia Commons)

molecule, 3-PGA. In stage 2, the organic molecule is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH. In stage 3, RuBP, the molecule that
starts the cycle, is regenerated so that the cycle can continue. Only one carbon dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle
must be completed three times to produce a single three-carbon GA3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule.

Bacterial Pathogens

The following tables list the species, and some higher groups, of pathogenic Eubacteria mentioned in the text. The
classification of Bacteria, one of the three domains of life, is in constant flux as relationships become clearer
through sampling of genetic sequences. Many groups at all taxonomic levels still have an undetermined relationship
with other members of the phylogenetic tree of Bacteria. Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria
maintains a published list and descriptions of prokaryotic species. The tables here follow the taxonomic
organization in the Bergey's Manual Taxonomic Outline.1

We have divided the species into tables corresponding to different bacterial phyla. The taxonomic rank of kingdom is
not used in prokaryote taxonomy, so the phyla are the subgrouping below domain. Note that many bacterial phyla
not represented by these tables. The species and genera are listed only under the class within each phylum. The
names given to bacteria are regulated by the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria as maintained by the
International Committee on Systematics or Prokaryotes.

Viral Pathogens

There are several classification systems for viruses. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is
the international scientific body responsible for the rules of viral classification. The ICTV system used here groups
viruses based on genetic similarity and presumed monophyly. The viral classification system is separate from the
classification system for cellular organisms. The ICTV system groups viruses within seven orders, which contain
related families. There is, presently, a large number of unassigned families with unknown affinities to the seven
orders. Three of these orders infect only Eubacteria, Archaea, or plants and do not appear in this table. Some
families may be divided into subfamilies. There are also many unassigned genera. Like all taxonomies, viral
taxonomy is in constant flux. The latest complete species list and classification can be obtained on the ICTV
website.2

Fungal Pathogens

The Fungi are one of the kingdoms of the domain Eukarya. Fungi are most closely related to the animals and a few
other small groups and more distantly related to the plants and other groups that formerly were categorized as
protist. At present, the Fungi are divided into seven phyla (or divisions, a hold over from when fungi were studied
with plants), but there are uncertainties about some relationships.3 Many groups of fungi, particularly those that
were formerly classified in the phylum Zygomycota, which was not monophyletic, have uncertain relationships to
the other fungi. The one species listed in this table that falls into this category is Rhizopus arrhizus. Fungal names
are governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants,4 but the International
Commission on the Taxonomy of Fungi (ICTF) also promotes taxonomic work on fungi. One activity of the ICTF is
publicizing name changes for medically and otherwise important fungal species. Many species that formerly had two
names (one for the sexual form and one for the asexual form) are now being brought together under one name.

Protozoan Pathogens

The relationships among the organisms (and thus their taxonomy) previously grouped under the name Protists are
better understood than they were two or three decades ago, but this is still a work in progress. In 2005, the Eukarya
were divided into six supergroups.5 The latest high-level classification combined two of the previous supergroups to
produce a system comprising five supergroups.6 This classification was developed for the Society of
Protozoologists, but it is not the only suggested approach. One of the five supergroups includes the animals, fungi,
and some smaller protist groups. Another contains green plants and three algal groups. The other three supergroups
(listed in the three tables below) contain the other protists, many of them which cause disease. In addition, there is
a large number of protist groups whose relationships are not understood. In the three supergroups represented here
we have indicated the phyla to which the listed pathogens belong.

Parasitic Helminths

The taxonomy of parasitic worms, all of which belong to the kingdom Animalia still contains many uncertainties. The
pathogenic species are found in two phyla: the Nematoda, or roundworms, and the Platyhelminthes, or flat worms.
The Nematoda is tentatively divided into two classes7 , one of which, Chromadorea, probably contains unrelated
groups. The parasitic flatworms are contained within three classes of flatworm, of which two are important to
humans, the trematodes and the cestodes.
