DEDICATION AND PREFACE

This 10th edition of Organic Chemistry is dedicated to the memory of my son, Peter McMurry, who passed away
in 2019 after a lifelong struggle with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). He was brilliant, strong, and truly the kindest person I
have ever known.

                                            Peter McMurry

                                   12/10/1968 - 12/12/2019

Just about every first-year medical student at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia Medical Center knew
and admired Peter, who was asked every year to meet and speak with incoming students about his experiences
as a patient. He always enjoyed talking to the students, kidding them about their having had to take organic
chemistry in college, and asking them if anyone recognized his last name from their O-Chem textbook.

If Peter were still alive, I have no doubt that he would want me to work on this 10th edition with a publisher that
would give the book away free to students rather than with one that would charge a large amount. So that is what
I have done. To make this possible, I am not receiving any payment for this book, and generous supporters have
not only covered the production costs but have also made a donation to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to help
find a cure for this terrible disease. Anything that readers of this book might donate in Peter's memory to the
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (https://openstax.org/r/22cystfibrofoun) would also be much appreciated.

   From the author--About Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition

   Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition, like previous editions, is intended for a two-semester introductory organic
   chemistry course. I recognize that many students in this course are biology or pre-med majors so, when
   appropriate, I bring in biological examples. Color is used consistently through the texts and illustrations.
   Problems are categorized (see below) and vary in level. My goal is to be as economical as possible with changes
   so that the overall length of Organic Chemistry does not increase.

Changes to the tenth edition
I continue to review every word and every explanation, updating many small details and improving problems
where needed. My aim is always to refine the features that made earlier editions so successful, while adding
new ones. Reviewer comments are also extensively considered during the reviewer process. All the problems in
every chapter are also reviewed for clarity. The detailed list of changes will be available upon publication at the
OpenStax website. However, the following is a list of the major changes made to the tenth edition.

Chapter 6

  · Polar Reactions are now covered before Radical Reactions

Chapter 17

  · Section 17.5: Added newly discovered reaction of Grignard reagents with carboxylic acids to prepare
      ketones

Chapter 18

  · Section 18.7: Added coverage of ionophores

Chapter 19

  · Section 19.5: Added coverage of alpha-keto acid hydrates

Chapter 21

  · Section 21.3: Added synthesis of amides by reaction of carboxylic acids and amines using
      (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDEC)

Chapter 26

  · Section 26.7: Added synthesis of amides by reaction of carboxylic acids and amines using
      (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDEC)

Coverage and scope
Organic Chemistry: A Tenth Edition, like previous editions, is intended for a two-semester introductory organic
chemistry course. The tenth edition retains the functional group approach of prior editions and the table of
contents is retained.

Pedagogical foundation and features
  · "Why This Chapter?" is a brief section that appears before the introduction to every chapter and tells
      students why the material about to be covered is important.
  · Worked Examples includes a strategy and a detailed solution and is followed by problems for students to
      try on their own. The tenth edition has more than 1800 in-text and end-of-chapter problems.
  · Visualizing Chemistry Problems occur at the end of each chapter. The problems offer students an
      opportunity to see chemistry in a different way by visualizing molecules rather than by simply interpreting
      structural formulas.
  · Mechanism Problems are grouped together at the end of each chapter.
  · Summaries and Key Terms lists help students by outlining the key concepts of each chapter.
  · Summaries of Reactions at the ends of appropriate chapters bring together the key reactions from the
      chapter in one complete list.

Academic integrity
Academic integrity builds trust, understanding, equity, and genuine learning. While students may encounter
significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree
of authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty,
administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive
experience.

We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To
that end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? We'll ease into the study of organic chemistry by first reviewing some ideas about atoms,
bonds, and molecular geometry that you may recall from your general chemistry course. Much of the material
in this chapter and the next is likely to be familiar to you, but it's nevertheless a good idea to make sure you
understand it before moving on.
What is organic chemistry, and why should you study it? The answers to these questions are all around you.
8  1 · Structure and Bonding

   Every living organism is made of organic chemicals. The proteins that make up your hair, skin, and muscles;
   the DNA that controls your genetic heritage; the foods that nourish you; and the medicines that heal you are all
   organic chemicals. Anyone with a curiosity about life and living things, and anyone who wants to be a part of
   the remarkable advances taking place in medicine and the biological sciences, must first understand organic
   chemistry. Look at the following drawings for instance, which show the chemical structures of some molecules
   whose names might be familiar to you. Although the drawings may appear unintelligible at this point, don't
   worry. They'll make perfectly good sense before long, and you'll soon be drawing similar structures for any
   substance you're interested in.

   Historically, the term organic chemistry dates to the mid-1700s, when it was used to mean the chemistry of
   substances found in living organisms. Little was known about chemistry at that time, and the behavior of the
   "organic" substances isolated from plants and animals seemed different from that of the "inorganic" substances
   found in minerals. Organic compounds were generally low-melting solids and were usually more difficult to
   isolate, purify, and work with than high-melting inorganic compounds.

   By the mid-1800s, however, it was clear that there was no fundamental difference between organic and
   inorganic compounds. The only distinguishing characteristic of organic compounds is that all contain the
   element carbon.

   Organic chemistry, then, is the study of carbon compounds. But why is carbon special? Why, of the more
   than 197 million presently known chemical compounds, do almost all of them contain carbon? The answers
   to these questions come from carbon's electronic structure and its consequent position in the periodic table
   (FIGURE 1.2). As a group 4A element, carbon can share four valence electrons and form four strong covalent
   bonds. Furthermore, carbon atoms can bond to one another, forming long chains and rings. Carbon, alone of all
   elements, is able to form an immense diversity of compounds, from the simple methane, with one carbon atom,
   to the staggeringly complex DNA, which can have more than 100 million carbons.

   FIGURE 1.2 Carbon, hydrogen, and other elements commonly found in organic compounds are shown in the colors typically used to
   represent them.

   Not all carbon compounds are derived from living organisms, however. Modern chemists have developed
   a remarkably sophisticated ability to design and synthesize new organic compounds in the
   laboratory--medicines, dyes, polymers, and a host of other substances. Organic chemistry touches the lives of

everyone. Its study can be a fascinating undertaking.

1.1 Atomic Structure: The Nucleus

As you might remember from your general chemistry course, an atom consists of a dense, positively charged
nucleus surrounded at a relatively large distance by negatively charged electrons (FIGURE 1.3). The nucleus
consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively
charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of
negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.

FIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded
by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density
increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.

Although extremely small--about 10-14 to 10-15 meter (m) in diameter--the nucleus nevertheless contains
essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a
distance of approximately 10-10 m. Thus, the diameter of a typical atom is about 2 × 10-10 m, or 200 picometers
(pm), where 1 pm = 10-12 m. To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million
carbon atoms wide. Although most chemists throughout the world use the International System (SI) of units and
describe small distances in picometers, many organic chemists and biochemists in the United States still use
the unit angstrom (Å) to express atomic distances, where 1 Å = 100 pm = 10-10 m. As you probably did in your
general chemistry course, however, we'll stay with SI units in this book.

A specific atom is described by its atomic number (Z), which gives the number of protons (or electrons) it
contains, and its mass number (A), which gives the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. All the
atoms of a given element have the same atomic number: 1 for hydrogen, 6 for carbon, 15 for phosphorus, and
so on; but they can have different mass numbers depending on how many neutrons they contain. Atoms with
the same atomic number but different mass numbers are called isotopes. The element carbon, for instance, has
three isotopes that occur naturally, with mass numbers of 12, 13, and 14. Carbon-12 has a natural abundance of
98.89%, carbon-13 has a natural abundance of 1.11%, and carbon-14 has only a negligible natural abundance.

The weighted-average of an element's naturally occurring isotopes is called atomic weight and is given in
unified atomic mass units (u) or daltons (Da) where 1 u or 1 Da is defined as one twelfth the mass of one atom of
carbon-12. Thus, the atomic weight is 1.008 u for hydrogen, 12.011 u for carbon, 30.974 u for phosphorus, and
so on. Atomic weights of all elements are given in the periodic table in Appendix D.

How are the electrons distributed in an atom? You might recall from your general chemistry course that,
according to the quantum mechanical model, the behavior of a specific electron in an atom can be described
by a mathematical expression called a wave equation--the same type of expression used to describe the motion
of waves in a fluid. The solution to a wave equation is called a wave function, or orbital, and is denoted by the
lowercase Greek letter psi ().

When the square of the wave function, 2, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the
volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an
orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital
would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been. This electron
cloud doesn't have a sharp boundary, but for practical purposes we can set the limits by saying that an orbital
represents the space where an electron spends 90% to 95% of its time.

What do orbitals look like? There are four different kinds of orbitals, denoted s, p, d, and f, each with a different
shape. Of the four, we'll be concerned primarily with s and p orbitals because these are the most common in
10  1 · Structure and Bonding

    organic and biological chemistry. An s orbital has a spherical shape, with the nucleus at its center; a p orbital
    has a dumbbell shape with two parts, or lobes; and four of the five d orbitals have a cloverleaf shape with four
    lobes, as shown in FIGURE 1.4. The fifth d orbital is shaped like an elongated dumbbell with a doughnut around
    its middle.

    FIGURE 1.4 Representations of s, p, and d orbitals. An s orbital is spherical, a p orbital is dumbbell-shaped, and four of the five d orbitals
    are cloverleaf-shaped. Different lobes of p orbitals are often drawn for convenience as teardrops, but their actual shape is more like that of
    a doorknob, as indicated.

    The orbitals in an atom are organized into different layers around the nucleus called electron shells, which
    are centered around the nucleus and have successively larger size and energy. Different shells contain different
    numbers and kinds of orbitals, and each orbital within a shell can be occupied by two electrons. The first shell
    contains only a single s orbital, denoted 1s, and thus holds only 2 electrons. The second shell contains one 2s
    orbital and three 2p orbitals and thus holds a total of 8 electrons. The third shell contains a 3s orbital, three 3p
    orbitals, and five 3d orbitals, for a total capacity of 18 electrons. These orbital groupings and their energy levels
    are shown in FIGURE 1.5.

    FIGURE 1.5 Energy levels of electrons in an atom. The first shell holds a maximum of 2 electrons in one 1s orbital; the second shell holds a
    maximum of 8 electrons in one 2s and three 2p orbitals; the third shell holds a maximum of 18 electrons in one 3s, three 3p, and 3d orbitals;
    and so on. The two electrons in each orbital are represented by five up and down arrows, Although not shown, the energy level of the 4s
    orbital falls between 3p and 3d.

    The three different p orbitals within a given shell are oriented in space along mutually perpendicular directions,
    denoted px, py, and pz. As shown in FIGURE 1.6, the two lobes of each p orbital are separated by a region of
    zero electron density called a node. Furthermore, the two orbital regions separated by the node have different
    algebraic signs, + and -, in the wave function, as represented by the different colors in FIGURE 1.4 and FIGURE
    1.6. As we'll see in Section 1.11, these algebraic signs for different orbital lobes have important consequences
    with respect to chemical bonding and chemical reactivity.

1.3 Atomic Structure: Electron Configurations

The lowest-energy arrangement, or ground-state electron configuration, of an atom is a list of the orbitals
occupied by its electrons. We can predict this arrangement by following three rules.

RULE 1

The lowest-energy orbitals fill up first,  , according to the following

graphic, a statement called the Aufbau principle. Note that the 4s orbital lies between the 3p and 3d orbitals in

energy.

RULE 2
Electrons act in some ways as if they were spinning around an axis, somewhat as the earth spins. This spin can
have two orientations, denoted as up () and down (). Only two electrons can occupy an orbital, and they must
have opposite spins, a statement called the Pauli exclusion principle.

RULE 3
If two or more empty orbitals of equal energy are available, one electron occupies each with spins parallel until
all orbitals are half-full, a statement called Hund's rule.

Some examples of how these rules apply are shown in TABLE 1.1. Hydrogen, for instance, has only one electron,
which must occupy the lowest-energy orbital. Thus, hydrogen has a 1s ground-state configuration. Carbon has
six electrons and the ground-state configuration 1s22s22px12py1, and so forth. Note that a superscript is used
to represent the number of electrons in a particular orbital.

    1.4 Development of Chemical Bonding Theory

    By the mid-1800s, the new science of chemistry was developing rapidly, especially in Europe, and chemists
    had begun to probe the forces holding compounds together. In 1858, the German chemist August Kekulé
    and the Scottish chemist Archibald Couper independently proposed that, in all organic compounds, carbon is
    tetravalent--it always forms four bonds when it joins other elements to form stable compounds. Furthermore,
    said Kekulé, carbon atoms can bond to one another to form extended chains of linked atoms. In 1865, Kekulé
    provided another major advance when he suggested that carbon chains can double back on themselves to form
    rings of atoms.

    Although Kekulé and Couper were correct in describing the tetravalent nature of carbon, chemistry was still
    viewed in a two-dimensional way until 1874. In that year, the Dutch chemist Jacobus van't Hoff and French
    chemist Joseph Le Bel added a third dimension to our ideas about organic compounds when they proposed that
    the four bonds of carbon are not oriented randomly but have specific spatial directions. Van't Hoff went even
    further and suggested that the four atoms to which carbon is bonded sit at the corners of a regular tetrahedron,
    with carbon in the center.

    A representation of a tetrahedral carbon atom is shown in FIGURE 1.7. Note the conventions used to show three-
    dimensionality: solid lines represent bonds in the plane of the page, the heavy wedged line represents a bond
    coming out of the page toward the viewer, and the dashed line represents a bond receding back behind the page,

behind the plane of the page away from the viewer.

Why, though, do atoms bond together, and how can chemical bonds be described electronically? The why
question is relatively easy to answer: atoms bond together because the compound that results is more stable
and lower in energy than the separate atoms. Energy--usually as heat--is always released and flows out of the
chemical system when a bond forms. Conversely, energy is added to the chemical system when a bond breaks.
Making bonds always releases energy, and breaking bonds always absorbs energy. The how question is more
difficult. To answer it, we need to know more about the electronic properties of atoms.

We know through observation that eight electrons (an electron octet) in an atom's outermost shell, or valence
shell, impart special stability to the noble-gas elements in group 8A of the periodic table: Ne (2 + 8); Ar (2 + 8 +
8); Kr (2 + 8 + 18 + 8). We also know that the chemistry of the main-group elements on the left and right sides
of the periodic table is governed by their tendency to take on the electron configuration of the nearest noble
gas. The alkali metals such as sodium in group 1A, for example, achieve a noble-gas configuration by losing
the single s electron from their valence shell to form a cation, while the halogens such as chlorine in group
7A achieve a noble-gas configuration by gaining a p electron to fill their valence shell and form an anion. The
resultant ions are held together in compounds like Na+ Cl- by the electrical attraction of unlike charges that we
call an ionic bond.

But how do elements closer to the middle of the periodic table form bonds? Look at methane, CH4, the main
constituent of natural gas, for example. The bonding in methane is not ionic because it would take too much
energy for carbon (1s2 2s2 2p2) either to gain or lose four electrons to achieve a noble-gas configuration.
Instead, carbon bonds to other atoms, not by gaining or losing electrons, but by sharing them. Such a shared-
electron bond, first proposed in 1916 by the American chemist G. N. Lewis, is called a covalent bond. The
neutral collection of atoms held together by covalent bonds is called a molecule. Ionic compounds such as
sodium chloride, however, are not called molecules.

A simple way of indicating the covalent bonds in molecules is to use what are called Lewis structures, or
electron-dot structures, in which the valence-shell electrons of an atom are represented as dots. Thus,
hydrogen has one dot representing its 1s electron, carbon has four dots (2s2 2p2), oxygen has six dots (2s2 2p4),
and so on. A stable molecule results whenever a noble-gas configuration of eight dots (an octet) is achieved
for all main-group atoms or two dots for hydrogen. Even simpler than Lewis structures is the use of Kekulé
structures, or line-bond structures, in which the two-electron covalent bonds are indicated as lines drawn
between atoms.
14  1 · Structure and Bonding

    The number of covalent bonds an atom forms depends on how many additional valence electrons it needs to
    reach a noble-gas configuration. Hydrogen has one valence electron (1s) and needs only one more to reach the
    helium configuration (1s2), so it forms one bond. Carbon has four valence electrons (2s2 2p2) and needs four
    more to reach the neon configuration (2s2 2p6), so it forms four bonds. Nitrogen has five valence electrons (2s2
    2p3), needs three more, and forms three bonds; oxygen has six valence electrons (2s2 2p4), needs two more, and
    forms two bonds; and the halogens have seven valence electrons, need one more, and form one bond.

    Valence electrons that are not used for bonding remain as dots in structures and are called lone-pair electrons,
    or nonbonding electrons. The nitrogen atom in ammonia, NH3, for instance, shares six valence electrons in
    three covalent bonds and has its remaining two valence electrons as two dots in a nonbonding lone pair. As a
    time-saving shorthand, nonbonding electrons are often omitted when drawing line-bond structures, but you
    still have to keep them in mind since they're often crucial in chemical reactions.

    Strategy
    Identify the periodic group of phosphorus, and find from that how many electrons (bonds) are needed to make

    Solution
    Phosphorus is in group 5A of the periodic table and has five valence electrons. It thus needs to share three more
    electrons to make an octet and therefore bonds to three hydrogen atoms, giving PH3.

1.5 Describing Chemical Bonds: Valence Bond Theory

How does electron sharing lead to bonding between atoms? Two models have been developed to describe
covalent bonding: valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory. Each model has its strengths and
weaknesses, and chemists tend to use them interchangeably depending on the circumstances. Valence bond
theory is the more easily visualized of the two, so most of the descriptions we'll use in this book derive from that
approach.

According to valence bond (VB) theory, a covalent bond forms when two atoms approach each other closely
and a singly occupied orbital on one atom overlaps a singly occupied orbital on the other atom. The electrons
are now paired in the overlapping orbitals and are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, thus bonding the
atoms together. In the H2 molecule, for instance, the H-H bond results from the overlap of two singly occupied
hydrogen 1s orbitals.
16  1 · Structure and Bonding

    The overlapping orbitals in the H2 molecule have the elongated egg shape we might get by pressing two
    spheres together. If a plane were to pass through the middle of the bond, the intersection of the plane and the

    overlapping orbitals would be a circle. In other words, the H-H bond is cylindrically symmetrical, as shown in

    FIGURE 1.8. Such bonds, which are formed by the head-on overlap of two atomic orbitals along a line drawn
    between the nuclei, are called sigma () bonds.

    FIGURE 1.8 The cylindrical symmetry of the H-H  bond in an H2 molecule. The intersection of a plane cutting through the  bond is a
    circle.

    During the bond-forming reaction 2H·  H2, 436 kJ/mol (104 kcal/mol) of energy is released. Because the
    product H2 molecule has 436 kJ/mol less energy than the starting 2 H· atoms, the product is more stable than
    the reactant and we say that the H-H bond has a bond strength of 436 kJ/mol. In other words, we would have to
    put 436 kJ/mol of energy into the H-H bond to break the H2 molecule apart into two H atoms (FIGURE 1.9). For
    convenience, we'll generally give energies in both kilocalories (kcal) and the SI unit kilojoules (kJ): 1 kJ = 0.2390
    kcal; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ.

    FIGURE 1.9 Relative energy levels of two H atoms and the H2 molecule. The H2 molecule has 436 kJ/mol (104 kcal/mol) less energy than
    the two separate H atoms, so 436 kJ/mol of energy is released when the H-H bond forms. Conversely, 436 kJ/mol is absorbed when the
    H-H bond breaks.

    How close are the two nuclei in the H2 molecule? If they are too close, they will repel each other because both
    are positively charged. Yet if they're too far apart, they won't be able to share the bonding electrons. Thus, there
    is an optimum distance between nuclei that leads to maximum stability (FIGURE 1.10). Called the bond length,
    this distance is 74 pm in the H-H molecule. Every covalent bond has both a characteristic bond strength and
    bond length.

1.6 sp3 Hybrid Orbitals and the Structure of Methane

The bonding in the hydrogen molecule is fairly straightforward, but the situation is more complicated in organic
molecules with tetravalent carbon atoms. Take methane, CH4, for instance. As we've seen, carbon has four
valence electrons (2s2 2p2) and forms four bonds. Because carbon uses two kinds of orbitals for bonding, 2s and
2p, we might expect methane to have two kinds of C-H bonds. In fact, though, all four C-H bonds in methane are
identical and are spatially oriented toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, as shown previously in FIGURE
1.7. How can we explain this?
An answer was provided in 1931 by Linus Pauling, who showed mathematically how an s orbital and three
p orbitals on an atom can combine, or hybridize, to form four equivalent atomic orbitals with tetrahedral
orientation. Shown in FIGURE 1.11, these tetrahedrally oriented orbitals are called sp3 hybrid orbitals. Note
that the superscript 3 in the name sp3 tells how many of each type of atomic orbital combine to form the hybrid,
not how many electrons occupy it.

FIGURE 1.11 Four sp3 hybrid orbitals, oriented toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, are formed by the combination of an
s orbital and three p orbitals (red/blue). The sp3 hybrids have two lobes and are unsymmetrical about the nucleus, giving them a
directionality and allowing them to form strong bonds to other atoms.

The concept of hybridization explains how carbon forms four equivalent tetrahedral bonds but not why it does
so. The shape of the hybrid orbital suggests the answer to why. When an s orbital hybridizes with three p orbitals,
the resultant sp3 hybrid orbitals are unsymmetrical about the nucleus. One of the two lobes is larger than the
other and can therefore overlap more effectively with an orbital from another atom to form a bond. As a result,
18  1 · Structure and Bonding

    sp3 hybrid orbitals form stronger bonds than do unhybridized s or p orbitals.

    The asymmetry of sp3 orbitals arises because, as noted previously, the two lobes of a p orbital have different
    algebraic signs, + and -, in the wave function. Thus, when a p orbital hybridizes with an s orbital, the positive
    p lobe adds to the s orbital but the negative p lobe subtracts from the s orbital. The resultant hybrid orbital is
    therefore unsymmetrical about the nucleus and is strongly oriented in one direction.

    When each of the four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals of a carbon atom overlaps with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen
    atom, four identical C-H bonds are formed and methane results. Each C-H bond in methane has a strength of
    439 kJ/mol (105 kcal/mol) and a length of 109 pm. Because the four bonds have a specific geometry, we also can
    define a property called the bond angle. The angle formed by each H-C-H is 109.5°, the so-called tetrahedral
    angle. Methane thus has the structure shown in FIGURE 1.12.

                                               FIGURE 1.12 The structure of methane, showing its 109.5° bond angles.

    1.7 sp3 Hybrid Orbitals and the Structure of Ethane

    The same kind of orbital hybridization that accounts for the methane structure also accounts for the bonding
    together of carbon atoms into chains and rings to make possible many millions of organic compounds. Ethane,
    C2H6, is the simplest molecule containing a carbon-carbon bond.

    We can picture the ethane molecule by imagining that the two carbon atoms bond to each other by head-on
    sigma () overlap of an sp3 hybrid orbital from each (FIGURE 1.13). The remaining three sp3 hybrid orbitals on
    each carbon overlap with the 1s orbitals of three hydrogens to form the six C-H bonds. The C-H bonds in ethane
    are similar to those in methane, although a bit weaker: 421 kJ/mol (101 kcal/mol) for ethane versus 439 kJ/mol
    for methane. The C-C bond is 153 pm in length and has a strength of 377 kJ/mol (90 kcal/mol). All the bond
    angles of ethane are near, although not exactly at, the tetrahedral value of 109.5°.

1.8 sp2 Hybrid Orbitals and the Structure of Ethylene

The bonds we've seen in methane and ethane are called single bonds because they result from the sharing of

one electron pair between bonded atoms. It was recognized nearly 150 years ago, however, that carbon atoms

can also form double bonds by sharing two electron pairs between atoms or triple bonds by sharing three

electron pairs. Ethylene, for instance, has the structure  and contains a carbon-carbon double bond,

while acetylene has the structure  and contains a carbon-carbon triple bond.

How are multiple bonds described by valence bond theory? When we discussed sp3 hybrid orbitals in Section
1.6, we said that the four valence-shell atomic orbitals of carbon combine to form four equivalent sp3 hybrids.
Imagine instead that the 2s orbital combines with only two of the three available 2p orbitals. Three sp2 hybrid
orbitals result, and one 2p orbital remains unchanged. Like sp3 hybrids, sp2 hybrid orbitals are unsymmetrical
about the nucleus and are strongly oriented in a specific direction so they can form strong bonds. The three sp2
orbitals lie in a plane at angles of 120° to one another, with the remaining p orbital perpendicular to the sp2

plane, as shown in FIGURE 1.14.

FIGURE 1.14 sp2 Hybridization. The three equivalent sp2 hybrid orbitals lie in a plane at angles of 120° to one another, and a single
unhybridized p orbital (red/blue) is perpendicular to the sp2 plane.

When two carbons with sp2 hybridization approach each other, they form a strong  bond by sp2-sp2 head-on
overlap. At the same time, the unhybridized p orbitals interact by sideways overlap to form what is called a pi
() bond. The combination of an sp2-sp2  bond and a 2p-2p  bond results in the sharing of four electrons and
the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond (FIGURE 1.15). Note that the electrons in the  bond occupy the
region centered between nuclei, while the electrons in the  bond occupy regions above and below a line drawn
between nuclei.

To complete the structure of ethylene, four hydrogen atoms form  bonds with the remaining four sp2 orbitals.
Ethylene thus has a planar structure, with H-C-H and H-C-C bond angles of approximately 120°. (The actual
values are 117.4° for the H-C-H bond angle and 121.3° for the H-C-C bond angle.) Each C-H bond has a length
of 108.7 pm and a strength of 464 kJ/mol (111 kcal/mol).
20  1 · Structure and Bonding

    FIGURE 1.15 The structure of ethylene. One part of the double bond in ethylene results from  (head-on) overlap of sp2 hybrid orbitals,
    and the other part results from  (sideways) overlap of unhybridized p orbitals (red/blue). The  bond has regions of electron density above
    and below a line drawn between nuclei.

    As you might expect, the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene is both shorter and stronger than the single
    bond in ethane because it has four electrons bonding the nuclei together rather than two. Ethylene has a
    bond length of 134 pm and a strength of 728 kJ/mol (174 kcal/mol) versus a C-C length of 153 pm and a strength
    of 377 kJ/mol for ethane. The carbon-carbon double bond is less than twice as strong as a single bond because
    the sideways overlap in the  part of the double bond is not as great as the head-on overlap in the  part.

1.9 sp Hybrid Orbitals and the Structure of Acetylene

In addition to forming single and double bonds by sharing two and four electrons, respectively, carbon can also
form a triple bond by sharing six electrons. To account for the triple bond in a molecule such as acetylene,

                , we need a third kind of hybrid orbital, an sp hybrid. Imagine that, instead of combining with two
or three p orbitals, a carbon 2s orbital hybridizes with only a single p orbital. Two sp hybrid orbitals result, and
two p orbitals remain unchanged. The two sp orbitals are oriented 180° apart on the right-left (x) axis, while the
p orbitals are perpendicular on the up-down (y) axis and the in-out (z) axis, as shown in FIGURE 1.16.

FIGURE 1.16 sp Hybridization. The two sp hybrid orbitals are oriented 180° away from each other, perpendicular to the two remaining p
orbitals (red/blue).

When two sp-hybridized carbon atoms approach each other, sp hybrid orbitals on each carbon overlap head-
on to form a strong sp-sp  bond. At the same time, the pz orbitals from each carbon form a pz-pz  bond by
sideways overlap, and the py orbitals overlap similarly to form a py-py  bond. The net effect is the sharing of
six electrons and formation of a carbon-carbon triple bond. Each of the two remaining sp hybrid orbitals forms
a  bond with hydrogen to complete the acetylene molecule (FIGURE 1.17).

    As suggested by sp hybridization, acetylene is a linear molecule with H-C-C bond angles of 180°. The C-H

    bonds have a length of 106 pm and a strength of 558 kJ/mol (133 kcal/mol). The C-C bond length in acetylene

    is 120 pm, and its strength is about 965 kJ/mol (231 kcal/mol), making it the shortest and strongest of any
    carbon-carbon bond. A comparison of sp, sp2, and sp3 hybridization is given in TABLE 1.2.

    1.10 Hybridization of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur

    The valence-bond concept of orbital hybridization described in the previous four sections is not limited to
    carbon. Covalent bonds formed by other elements can also be described using hybrid orbitals. Look, for
    instance, at the nitrogen atom in methylamine (CH3NH2), an organic derivative of ammonia (NH3) and the
    substance responsible for the odor of rotting fish.

    The experimentally measured H-N-H bond angle in methylamine is 107.1°, and the C-N-H bond angle is

1.10 · Hybridization of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur                                                      23

110.3°, both of which are close to the 109.5° tetrahedral angle found in methane. We therefore assume that
nitrogen forms four sp3-hybridized orbitals, just as carbon does. One of the four sp3 orbitals is occupied by two

nonbonding electrons (a lone pair), and the other three hybrid orbitals have one electron each. Overlap of these

three half-filled nitrogen orbitals with half-filled orbitals from other atoms (C or H) gives methylamine. Note that
the unshared lone pair of electrons in the fourth sp3 hybrid orbital of nitrogen occupies as much space as an

N-H bond does and is very important to the chemistry of methylamine and other nitrogen-containing organic

molecules.

Like the carbon atom in methane and the nitrogen atom in methylamine, the oxygen atom in methanol (methyl
alcohol) and many other organic molecules can be described as sp3-hybridized. The C-O-H bond angle in
methanol is 108.5°, very close to the 109.5° tetrahedral angle. Two of the four sp3 hybrid orbitals on oxygen are

occupied by nonbonding electron lone pairs, and two are used to form bonds.

In the periodic table, phosphorus and sulfur are the third-row analogs of nitrogen and oxygen, and the bonding
in both can be described using hybrid orbitals. Because of their positions in the third row, however, both
phosphorus and sulfur can expand their outer-shell octets and form more than the typical number of covalent
bonds. Phosphorus, for instance, often forms five covalent bonds, and sulfur often forms four.

Phosphorus is most commonly encountered in biological molecules in compounds called organophosphates,
which contain a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygens, with one of the oxygens also bonded to carbon.
Methyl phosphate, CH3OPO32-, is the simplest example. The O-P-O bond angle in such compounds is typically
in the range 110° to 112°, implying sp3 hybridization for phosphorus orbitals.

Sulfur is most commonly encountered in biological molecules either in compounds called thiols, which have a
sulfur atom bonded to one hydrogen and one carbon, C-S-H or in sulfides, which have a sulfur atom bonded to
two carbons, C-S-C. Produced by some bacteria, methanethiol (CH3SH) is the simplest example of a thiol, and
dimethyl sulfide, H3C-S-CH3, is the simplest example of a sulfide. Both can be described by approximate sp3
hybridization around sulfur, although both have significant deviation from the 109.5° tetrahedral angle.

    1.11 Describing Chemical Bonds: Molecular Orbital Theory

    We said in Section 1.5 that chemists use two models for describing covalent bonds: valence bond theory and
    molecular orbital theory. Having now seen the valence bond approach, which uses hybrid atomic orbitals to
    account for geometry and assumes the overlap of atomic orbitals to account for electron sharing, let's look
    briefly at the molecular orbital approach to bonding. We'll return to this topic in Chapters 14, 15, and 30 for a
    more in-depth discussion.
    Molecular orbital (MO) theory describes covalent bond formation as arising from a mathematical combination
    of atomic orbitals (wave functions) on different atoms to form molecular orbitals, so called because they belong
    to the entire molecule rather than to an individual atom. Just as an atomic orbital, whether unhybridized or
    hybridized, describes a region of space around an atom where an electron is likely to be found, so a molecular
    orbital describes a region of space in a molecule where electrons are most likely to be found.
    Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the H2 molecule, for
    example, two singly occupied 1s atomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways
    for the orbital combination to occur--an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads
    to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive
    combination leads to a molecular orbital that is higher in energy and has a node between nuclei (FIGURE 1.18).
    Note that the additive combination is a single, egg-shaped, molecular orbital; it is not the same as the two
    overlapping 1s atomic orbitals of the valence bond description. Similarly, the subtractive combination is a single
    molecular orbital with the shape of an elongated dumbbell.

FIGURE 1.18 Molecular orbitals of H2. Combination of two hydrogen 1s atomic orbitals leads to two H2 molecular orbitals. The lower-
energy, bonding MO is filled, and the higher-energy, antibonding MO is unfilled.

The additive combination is lower in energy than the two hydrogen 1s atomic orbitals and is called a bonding
MO because electrons in this MO spend most of their time in the region between the two nuclei, thereby bonding
the atoms together. The subtractive combination is higher in energy than the two hydrogen 1s orbitals and is
called an antibonding MO because any electrons it contains can't occupy the central region between the nuclei,
where there is a node, and thus can't contribute to bonding. The two nuclei therefore repel each other.

Just as bonding and antibonding  molecular orbitals result from the head-on combination of two s atomic
orbitals in H2, so bonding and antibonding  molecular orbitals result from the sideways combination of two
p atomic orbitals in ethylene. As shown in FIGURE 1.19, the lower-energy,  bonding MO has no node between
nuclei and results from the combination of p orbital lobes with the same algebraic sign. The higher-energy, 
antibonding MO has a node between nuclei and results from the combination of lobes with opposite algebraic
signs. Only the bonding MO is occupied; the higher-energy, antibonding MO is vacant. We'll see in Chapters 14,
15, and 30 that molecular orbital theory is particularly useful for describing  bonds in compounds that have
more than one double bond.

combination of p orbital lobes with the same algebraic sign and is filled. The higher-energy,  antibonding MO results from a subtractive
combination of p orbital lobes with opposite algebraic signs and is unfilled.

1.12 Drawing Chemical Structures

Let's cover just one more point before ending this introductory chapter. In the structures we've been drawing
until now, a line between atoms has represented the two electrons in a covalent bond. Drawing every bond
and every atom is tedious, however, so chemists have devised several shorthand ways for writing structures.
In condensed structures, carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon single bonds aren't shown; instead, they're
understood. If a carbon has three hydrogens bonded to it, we write CH3; if a carbon has two hydrogens bonded
to it, we write CH2; and so on. The compound called 2-methylbutane, for example, is written as follows:
26  1 · Structure and Bonding

    Note that the horizontal bonds between carbons aren't shown in condensed structures--the CH3, CH2, and
    CH units are simply placed next to each other--but vertical carbon-carbon bonds like that of the first of the
    condensed structures drawn above is shown for clarity. Notice also in the second of the condensed structures
    that the two CH3 units attached to the CH carbon are grouped together as (CH3)2.

    Even simpler than condensed structures are skeletal structures such as those shown in TABLE 1.3. The rules
    for drawing skeletal structures are straightforward.

    RULE 1
    Carbon atoms aren't usually shown. Instead, a carbon atom is assumed to be at each intersection of two lines
    (bonds) and at the end of each line. Occasionally, a carbon atom might be indicated for emphasis or clarity.

    RULE 2
    Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon aren't shown. Because carbon always has a valence of 4, we mentally supply
    the correct number of hydrogen atoms for each carbon.

    RULE 3
    Atoms other than carbon and hydrogen are shown.

    One further comment: Although such groupings as -CH3, -OH, and -NH2 are usually written with the C, O, or N
    atom first and the H atom second, the order of writing is sometimes inverted to H3C-, HO-, and H2N- if needed
    to make the bonding connections clearer. Larger units such as -CH2CH3 are not inverted, though; we don't
    write H3CH2C- because it would be confusing. There are, however, no well-defined rules that cover all cases; it's
    largely a matter of preference.

Organic Foods: Risk versus Benefit

Contrary to what you may hear in supermarkets or on television, all foods are organic--that is, complex mixtures
of organic molecules. Even so, when applied to food, the word organic has come to mean an absence of synthetic
chemicals, typically pesticides, antibiotics, and preservatives. How concerned should we be about traces of
pesticides in the food we eat? Or toxins in the water we drink? Or pollutants in the air we breathe?
Life is not risk-free--we all take many risks each day without even thinking about it. We decide to ride a bike
rather than drive, even though there is a ten times greater likelihood per mile of dying in a bicycling accident
than in a car. We decide to walk down stairs rather than take an elevator, even though 32,000 people die from
falls each year in the United States. Some of us decide to smoke cigarettes, even though it increases our chance
of getting cancer by 50%. But what about risks from chemicals like pesticides?

FIGURE 1.20 How dangerous is the pesticide being sprayed on this crop? (credit: "NRCSAR83001(265)" by USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

One thing is certain: without pesticides, whether they target weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides), or molds
and fungi (fungicides), crop production would drop significantly, food prices would increase, and famines would
occur in less developed parts of the world. Take the herbicide atrazine, for instance. In the United States
alone, approximately 100 million pounds of atrazine are used each year to kill weeds in corn, sorghum, and
sugarcane fields, greatly improving the yields of these crops. Nevertheless, the use of atrazine continues to be
a concern because traces persist in the environment. Indeed, heavy atrazine exposure can pose health risks to
humans and some animals. Because of these risks, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
has decided not to ban its use because doing so would result in lower crop yields and increased food costs, and
because there is no suitable alternative herbicide available.

How can the potential hazards from a chemical like atrazine be determined? Risk evaluation of chemicals is
carried out by exposing test animals, usually mice or rats, to the chemical and then monitoring the animals
for signs of harm. To limit the expense and time needed, the amounts administered are typically hundreds or
thousands of times greater than those a person might normally encounter. The results obtained in animal tests
are then distilled into a single number called an LD50, the amount of substance per kilogram of body weight that

is a lethal dose for 50% of the test animals. For atrazine, the LD50 value is between 1 and 4 g/kg depending on
the animal species. Aspirin, for comparison, has an LD50 of 1.1 g/kg, and ethanol (ethyl alcohol) has an LD50 of
10.6 g/kg.

TABLE 1.4 lists the LD50 for some other familiar substances. The lower the value, the more toxic the substance.
Note, though, that LD50 values only pertain to the effects of heavy exposure for a relatively short time. They say
nothing about the risks of long-term exposure, such as whether the substance can cause cancer or interfere

with development in the unborn.

           TABLE 1.4 Some LD50 Values

           Substance                   LD50 (g/kg) Substance    LD50 (g/kg)

           Strychnine                  0.005  Chloroform        1.2

           Arsenic trioxide 0.015             Iron(II) sulfate  1.5

           DDT                         0.115  Ethyl alcohol     10.6

           Aspirin                     1.1    Sodium cyclamate 17

So, should we still use atrazine? All decisions involve tradeoffs, and the answer is rarely obvious. Does the
benefit of increased food production outweigh possible health risks of a pesticide? Do the beneficial effects of
a new drug outweigh a potentially dangerous side effect in a small number of users? Different people will have
different opinions, but an honest evaluation of facts is surely the best way to start. As of June 2022, atrazine
was still approved for continued use in the United States because the EPA believes that the benefits of increased
food production outweigh possible health risks. At the same time, atrazine is little used, though not banned, in
the European Union.

Summary

The purpose of this chapter has been to get you up to speed--to review some ideas about atoms, bonds, and
molecular geometry. As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division
into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.
30 1 · Additional Problems

An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons.
The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which
electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels
and different shapes. For example, s orbitals are spherical and p orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The ground-
state electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning
with the lowest-energy ones.

A covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB)
theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO)
theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which
belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction
are called sigma () bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of p orbitals are called pi () bonds.

In the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming
only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent sp3 hybrid orbitals. When forming a
double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent sp2 hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized p
orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals and two
unhybridized p orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals
to form strong, oriented bonds.

Organic molecules are usually drawn using either condensed structures or skeletal structures. In condensed
structures, carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds aren't shown. In skeletal structures, only the bonds
and not the atoms are shown. A carbon atom is assumed to be at the ends and at the junctions of lines (bonds),
and the correct number of hydrogens is supplied mentally.

  WHY YOU SHOULD WORK PROBLEMS

  There's no surer way to learn organic chemistry than by working problems. Although careful reading and
  rereading of this text are important, reading alone isn't enough. You must also be able to use the information
  you've read and be able to apply your knowledge in new situations. Working problems gives you practice at
  doing this.

  Each chapter in this book provides many problems of different sorts. The in-chapter problems are placed for
  immediate reinforcement of ideas just learned, while end-of-chapter problems provide additional practice
  and come in several forms. They often begin with a short section called "Visualizing Chemistry," which helps
  you see the microscopic world of molecules and provides practice for working in three dimensions. After the
  visualizations are many further problems, which are organized by topic. Early problems are primarily of the
  drill type, providing an opportunity for you to practice your command of the fundamentals. Later problems
  tend to be more thought-provoking, and some are real challenges.

  As you study organic chemistry, take the time to work the problems. Do the ones you can, and ask for help
  on the ones you can't. If you're stumped by a particular problem, check the accompanying Study Guide and
  Student Solutions Manual for an explanation that should help clarify the difficulty. Working problems takes
  effort, but the payoff in knowledge and understanding is immense.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Understanding organic chemistry means knowing not just what happens but also why
and how it happens at the molecular level. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the ways that chemists describe
and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation to understand the specific reactions
discussed in subsequent chapters. Topics such as bond polarity, the acid-base behavior of molecules, and
hydrogen-bonding are a particularly important part of that foundation.
We saw in the previous chapter how covalent bonds between atoms are described, and we looked at the valence
38  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    bond model, which uses hybrid orbitals to account for the observed shapes of organic molecules. Before going
    on to a systematic study of organic chemistry, however, we still need to review a few fundamental topics. In
    particular, we need to look more closely at how electrons are distributed in covalent bonds and at some of the
    consequences that arise when the electrons in a bond are not shared equally between atoms.

    2.1 Polar Covalent Bonds and Electronegativity

    Up to this point, we've treated chemical bonds as either ionic or covalent. The bond in sodium chloride,
    for instance, is ionic. Sodium transfers an electron to chlorine to produce Na+ and Cl- ions, which are held
    together in the solid by electrostatic attractions between unlike charges. The C-C bond in ethane, however,
    is covalent. The two bonding electrons are shared equally by the two equivalent carbon atoms, resulting in a
    symmetrical electron distribution in the bond. Most bonds, however, are neither fully ionic nor fully covalent
    but are somewhere between the two extremes. Such bonds are called polar covalent bonds, meaning that the
    bonding electrons are attracted more strongly by one atom than the other so that the electron distribution
    between atoms is not symmetrical (FIGURE 2.2).

    FIGURE 2.2 The continuum in bonding from covalent to ionic is a result of an unequal distribution of bonding electrons between
    atoms. The symbol  (lowercase Greek letter delta) means partial charge, either partial positive (+) for the electron-poor atom or partial
    negative (-) for the electron-rich atom.

    Bond polarity is due to differences in electronegativity (EN), the intrinsic ability of an atom to attract the shared
    electrons in a covalent bond. As shown in FIGURE 2.3, electronegativities are based on an arbitrary scale, with
    fluorine the most electronegative (EN = 4.0) and cesium the least (EN = 0.7). Metals on the left side of the
    periodic table attract electrons weakly and have lower electronegativities, while oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens
    on the right side of the periodic table attract electrons strongly and have higher electronegativities. Carbon, the
    most important element in organic compounds, has an intermediate electronegativity value of 2.5.

    FIGURE 2.3 Electronegativity values and trends. Electronegativity generally increases from left to right across the periodic table and
    decreases from top to bottom. The values are on an arbitrary scale, with F = 4.0 and Cs = 0.7. Elements in red are the most electronegative,
    those in yellow are medium, and those in green are the least electronegative.

    As a rough guide, bonds between atoms whose electronegativities differ by less than 0.5 are nonpolar covalent,
    bonds between atoms whose electronegativities differ by 0.5 to 2 are polar covalent, and bonds between atoms
    whose electronegativities differ by more than 2 are largely ionic. Carbon-hydrogen bonds, for example, are
    relatively nonpolar because carbon (EN = 2.5) and hydrogen (EN = 2.1) have similar electronegativities. Bonds
    between carbon and more electronegative elements such as oxygen (EN = 3.5) and nitrogen (EN = 3.0), by
    contrast, are polarized so that the bonding electrons are drawn away from carbon toward the electronegative
    atom. This leaves carbon with a partial positive charge, -, and the electronegative atom with a partial negative
    charge, -. An example is the C-O bond in methanol, CH3OH (FIGURE 2.4a). Bonds between carbon and less

electronegative elements are polarized so that carbon bears a partial negative charge and the other atom bears
a partial positive charge. An example is the C-Li bond in methyllithium, CH3Li (FIGURE 2.4b).

FIGURE 2.4 Polar covalent bonds. (a) Methanol, CH3OH, has a polar covalent C-O bond, and (b) methyllithium, CH3Li, has a polar covalent
C-Li bond. The computer-generated representations, called electrostatic potential maps, use color to show calculated charge distributions,

ranging from red (electron-rich; -) to blue (electron-poor; +).

Note in the representations of methanol and methyllithium in FIGURE 2.4 that a crossed arrow  is used to

indicate the direction of bond polarity. By convention, electrons are displaced in the direction of the arrow. The
tail of the arrow (which looks like a plus sign) is electron-poor (+), and the head of the arrow is electron-rich
(-).

Note also in FIGURE 2.4 that calculated charge distributions in molecules can be displayed visually with what
are called electrostatic potential maps, which use color to indicate electron-rich (red; -) and electron-poor
(blue; +) regions. In methanol, oxygen carries a partial negative charge and is colored red, while the carbon
and hydrogen atoms carry partial positive charges and are colored blue-green. In methyllithium, lithium carries
a partial positive charge (blue), while carbon and the hydrogen atoms carry partial negative charges (red).
Electrostatic potential maps are useful because they show at a glance the electron-rich and electron-poor atoms
in molecules. We'll make frequent use of these maps throughout the text and will see many examples of how
electronic structure correlates with chemical reactivity.

When speaking of an atom's ability to polarize a bond, we often use the term inductive effect. An inductive
effect is simply the shifting of electrons in a  bond in response to the electronegativity of nearby atoms. Metals,
such as lithium and magnesium, inductively donate electrons, whereas reactive nonmetals, such as oxygen
and nitrogen, inductively withdraw electrons. Inductive effects play a major role in understanding chemical
reactivity, and we'll use them many times throughout this text to explain a variety of chemical observations.

    2.2 Polar Covalent Bonds and Dipole Moments

    Just as individual bonds are often polar, molecules as a whole are often polar as well. Molecular polarity results
    from the vector summation of all individual bond polarities and lone-pair contributions in the molecule. As
    a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar
    substances are insoluble in water.

    Net polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole moment and can be thought of in the following way:
    assume that there is a center of mass of all positive charges (nuclei) in a molecule and a center of mass of all
    negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don't coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.

    The dipole moment,  (lowercase Greek letter mu), is defined as the magnitude of the charge Q at either end
    of the molecular dipole times the distance r between the charges,  = Q × r. Dipole moments are expressed in
    debyes (D), where 1 D = 3.336 × 10-30 coulomb meters (C · m) in SI units. For example, the unit charge on an
    electron is 1.60 × 10-19 C. Thus, if one positive charge and one negative charge are separated by 100 pm (a bit
    less than the length of a typical covalent bond), the dipole moment is 1.60 × 10-29 C · m, or 4.80 D.

    Dipole moments for some common substances are given in TABLE 2.1. Of the compounds shown in the table,
    sodium chloride has the largest dipole moment (9.00 D) because it is ionic. Even small molecules like water
    ( = 1.85 D), methanol (CH3OH;  = 1.70 D), and ammonia ( = 1.47 D), have substantial dipole moments,
    however, both because they contain strongly electronegative atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and because all
    three molecules have lone-pair electrons. The lone-pair electrons on oxygen and nitrogen stick out into space
    away from the positively charged nuclei, giving rise to a considerable charge separation and making a large
    contribution to the dipole moment.

In contrast with water, methanol, and ammonia, molecules such as carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and
benzene have zero dipole moments. Because of the symmetrical structures of these molecules, the individual
bond polarities and lone-pair contributions exactly cancel.

        WORKED EXAMPLE 2.1

Predicting the Direction of a Dipole Moment

Make a three-dimensional drawing of methylamine, CH3NH2, and show the direction of its dipole moment ( =
1.31).

Strategy
Look for any lone-pair electrons, and identify any atom with an electronegativity substantially different from
that of carbon. (Usually, this means O, N, F, Cl, or Br.) Electron density will be displaced in the general direction
of the electronegative atoms and the lone pairs.

Solution
Methylamine contains an electronegative nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons. The dipole moment thus
points generally from -CH3 toward the lone pair.

    2.3 Formal Charges

    Closely related to the ideas of bond polarity and dipole moment is the assignment of formal charges to specific
    atoms within a molecule, particularly atoms that have an apparently "abnormal" number of bonds. Look at
    dimethyl sulfoxide (CH3SOCH3), for instance, a solvent commonly used for preserving biological cell lines at low
    temperature. The sulfur atom in dimethyl sulfoxide has three bonds rather than the usual two and has a formal
    positive charge. The oxygen atom, by contrast, has one bond rather than the usual two and has a formal negative
    charge. Note that an electrostatic potential map of dimethyl sulfoxide shows the oxygen as negative (red) and
    the sulfur as relatively positive (blue), in accordance with the formal charges.

    Formal charges, as the name suggests, are a formalism and don't imply the presence of actual ionic charges
    in a molecule. Instead, they're a device for electron "bookkeeping" and can be thought of in the following way:
    A typical covalent bond is formed when each atom donates one electron. Although the bonding electrons are
    shared by both atoms, each atom can still be considered to "own" one electron for bookkeeping purposes. In
    methane, for instance, the carbon atom owns one electron in each of the four C-H bonds. Because a neutral,
    isolated carbon atom has four valence electrons, and because the carbon atom in methane still owns four, the
    methane carbon atom is neutral and has no formal charge.

    The same is true for the nitrogen atom in ammonia, which has three covalent N-H bonds and two nonbonding
    electrons (a lone pair). Atomic nitrogen has five valence electrons, and the ammonia nitrogen also has five--one
    in each of three shared N-H bonds plus two in the lone pair. Thus, the nitrogen atom in ammonia has no formal
    charge.

    The situation is different in dimethyl sulfoxide. Atomic sulfur has six valence electrons, but the dimethyl
    sulfoxide sulfur owns only five--one in each of the two S-C single bonds, one in the S-O single bond, and two
    in a lone pair. Thus, the sulfur atom has formally lost an electron and therefore has a positive formal charge. A
    similar calculation for the oxygen atom shows that it has formally gained an electron and has a negative charge.
    Atomic oxygen has six valence electrons, but the oxygen in dimethyl sulfoxide has seven--one in the O-S bond
    and two in each of three lone pairs. Thus, the oxygen has formally gained an electron and has a negative formal
    charge.

To express the calculations in a general way, the formal charge on an atom is equal to the number of valence
electrons in a neutral, isolated atom minus the number of electrons owned by that bonded atom in a molecule.
The number of electrons in the bonded atom, in turn, is equal to half the number of bonding electrons plus the
nonbonding, lone-pair electrons.

A summary of commonly encountered formal charges and the bonding situations in which they occur is given
in TABLE 2.2. Although only a bookkeeping device, formal charges often give clues about chemical reactivity, so
it's helpful to be able to identify and calculate them correctly.

    2.4 Resonance

    Most substances can be represented unambiguously by the Kekulé line-bond structures we've been using up to
    this point, but an interesting problem sometimes arises. Look at the acetate ion, for instance. When we draw a
    line-bond structure for acetate, we need to show a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other. But
    which oxygen is which? Should we draw a double bond to the "top" oxygen and a single bond to the "bottom"
    oxygen, or vice versa?

    Although the two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion appear different in line-bond structures, experiments show

    that they are equivalent. Both carbon-oxygen bonds, for instance, are 127 pm in length, midway between the

    length of a typical C-O single bond (135 pm) and a typical  double bond (120 pm). In other words, neither

    of the two structures for acetate is correct by itself. The true structure is intermediate between the two, and an

    electrostatic potential map shows that both oxygen atoms share the negative charge and have equal electron

    densities (red).

    The two individual line-bond structures for acetate ion are called resonance forms, and their special resonance
    relationship is indicated by the double-headed arrow between them. The only difference between the two
    resonance forms is the placement of the  and nonbonding valence electrons. The atoms themselves occupy
    exactly the same place in both resonance forms, the connections between atoms are the same, and the three-
    dimensional shapes of the resonance forms are the same.

    A good way to think about resonance forms is to realize that a substance like the acetate ion is the same as any
    other. Acetate doesn't jump back and forth between two resonance forms, spending part of the time looking like
    one and part of the time looking like the other. Rather, acetate has a single unchanging structure that we say is a
    resonance hybrid of the two individual forms and has characteristics of both. The only "problem" with acetate
    is that we can't draw it accurately using a familiar line-bond structure--line-bond structures just don't work for
    resonance hybrids. The difficulty, however, is with the representation of acetate on paper, not with acetate itself.

    Resonance is a very useful concept that we'll return to on numerous occasions throughout the rest of this
    book. We'll see in Chapter 15, for instance, that the six carbon-carbon bonds in aromatic compounds, such as
    benzene, are equivalent and that benzene is best represented as a hybrid of two resonance forms. Although each
    individual resonance form seems to imply that benzene has alternating single and double bonds, neither form
    is correct by itself. The true benzene structure is a hybrid of the two individual forms, and all six carbon-carbon
    bonds are equivalent. This symmetrical distribution of electrons around the molecule is evident in an

electrostatic potential map.

2.5 Rules for Resonance Forms

When first dealing with resonance forms, it's useful to have a set of guidelines that describe how to draw and
interpret them. The following rules should be helpful:

RULE 1
Individual resonance forms are imaginary, not real. The real structure is a composite, or resonance hybrid,
of the different forms. Species such as the acetate ion and benzene are no different from any other. They
have single, unchanging structures, and they don't switch back and forth between resonance forms. The only
difference between these and other substances is in the way they are represented in drawings.

RULE 2

Resonance forms differ only in the placement of their  or nonbonding electrons. Neither the position nor

the hybridization of any atom changes from one resonance form to another. In the acetate ion, for instance, the
carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and the oxygen atoms remain in exactly the same place in both resonance forms.

Only the positions of the  electrons in the  bond and the lone-pair electrons on oxygen differ from one

form to another. This movement of electrons from one resonance structure to another can be indicated with

curved arrows. A curved arrow always indicates the movement of electrons, not the movement of atoms. An

arrow shows that a pair of electrons moves from the atom or bond at the tail of the arrow to the atom or bond at

the head of the arrow.

The situation with benzene is similar to that with acetate. The  electrons in the double bonds move, as shown
with curved arrows, but the carbon and hydrogen atoms remain in place.

RULE 3

Different resonance forms of a substance don't have to be equivalent. As an example, we'll see in Chapter

22 that a compound such as acetone, which contains a  bond, can be converted into its anion by reaction

with a strong base. The resultant anion has two resonance forms. One form contains a carbon-oxygen double

bond and has a negative charge on carbon; the other contains a carbon-carbon double bond and has a negative

charge on oxygen. Even though the two resonance forms aren't equivalent, both contribute to the overall
46  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    resonance hybrid.

    When two resonance forms are nonequivalent, the actual structure of the resonance hybrid resembles the more
    stable form. Thus, we might expect the true structure of the acetone anion to be more like that of the form that
    places the negative charge on the electronegative oxygen atom rather than on the carbon.
    RULE 4
    Resonance forms obey normal rules of valency. A resonance form is like any other structure: the octet rule
    still applies to second-row, main-group atoms. For example, one of the following structures for the acetate ion
    is not a valid resonance form because the carbon atom has five bonds and ten valence electrons:

    RULE 5
    The resonance hybrid is more stable than any individual resonance form. In other words, resonance leads
    to stability. Generally speaking, the larger the number of resonance forms a substance has, the more stable the
    substance is, because its electrons are spread out over a larger part of the molecule and are closer to more
    nuclei. We'll see in Chapter 15, for instance, that a benzene ring is more stable because of resonance than might
    otherwise be expected.

    2.6 Drawing Resonance Forms

    Look back at the resonance forms of the acetate ion and the acetone anion shown in the previous section. The
    pattern seen there is a common one that leads to a useful technique for drawing resonance forms. In general,
    any three-atom grouping with a p orbital on each atom has two resonance forms:

    The atoms X, Y, and Z in the general structure might be C, N, O, P, S, or others, and the asterisk (*) might mean
    that the p orbital on atom Z is vacant, that it contains a single electron, or that it contains a lone pair of electrons.
    The two resonance forms differ simply by an exchange in position of the multiple bond and the asterisk from
    one end of the three-atom grouping to the other.
    By learning to recognize such three-atom groupings within larger structures, resonance forms can be
    systematically generated. Look, for instance, at the anion produced when H+ is removed from 2,4-pentanedione
    by reaction with a base. How many resonance structures does the resultant anion have?

                                                                            2.6 · Drawing Resonance Forms           47

The 2,4-pentanedione anion has a lone pair of electrons and a formal negative charge on the central carbon

atom, next to a     bond on the left. The  grouping is a typical one for which two resonance

structures can be drawn.

Just as there is a  bond to the left of the lone pair, there is a second    bond to the right. Thus, we can

draw a total of three resonance structures for the 2,4-pentanedione anion.

        WORKED EXAMPLE 2.2

Drawing Resonance Forms for an Anion

Draw three resonance structures for the carbonate ion, CO32-.

Strategy

Look for three-atom groupings that contain a multiple bond next to an atom with a p orbital. Then exchange the

positions of the multiple bond and the electrons in the p orbital. In the carbonate ion, each singly bonded oxygen

atom with three lone pairs and a negative charge is adjacent to the         double bond, giving the grouping

          .

Solution
Exchanging the position of the double bond and an electron lone pair in each grouping generates three
resonance structures.

basicity. We'll soon see, in fact, that the acid-base behavior of organic molecules explains much of their
chemistry. You may recall from a course in general chemistry that two definitions of acidity are frequently used:
the Brønsted-Lowry definition and the Lewis definition. We'll look at the Brønsted-Lowry definition in this and
the following three sections and then discuss the Lewis definition in Section 2.11.

A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a substance that donates a hydrogen ion, H+, and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a
substance that accepts a hydrogen ion. (The name proton is often used as a synonym for H+ because loss of
the valence electron from a neutral hydrogen atom leaves only the hydrogen nucleus--a proton.) When gaseous
hydrogen chloride dissolves in water, for example, a polar HCl molecule acts as an acid and donates a proton,
while a water molecule acts as a base and accepts the proton, yielding chloride anion (Cl-) and hydronium
cation (H3O+). This and other acid-base reactions are reversible, so we'll write them with double, forward-and-
backward arrows.

Chloride ion, the product that results when the acid HCl loses a proton, is called the conjugate base of the acid,
and hydronium ion, the product that results when the base H2O gains a proton, is called the conjugate acid of
the base. Other common mineral acids such as H2SO4 and HNO3 behave similarly, as do organic acids such as
acetic acid, CH3CO2H.
In a general sense,

For example:

Notice that water can act either as an acid or as a base, depending on the circumstances. In its reaction with
HCl, water is a base that accepts a proton to give the hydronium ion, H3O+. In its reaction with ammonia (NH3),
however, water is an acid that donates a proton to give ammonium ion (NH4+) and hydroxide ion, HO-.

PROBLEM Nitric acid (HNO3) reacts with ammonia (NH3) to yield ammonium nitrate. Write the reaction, and
        2-11 identify the acid, the base, the conjugate acid product, and the conjugate base product.
50  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    2.8 Acid and Base Strength

    Different acids differ in their ability to donate H+. Stronger acids, such as HCl, react almost completely with
    water, whereas weaker acids, such as acetic acid (CH3CO2H), react only slightly. The exact strength of a given
    acid HA in water solution is described using the acidity constant (Ka) for the acid-dissociation equilibrium.
    Recall from general chemistry that the concentration of solvent is ignored in the equilibrium expression and
    that brackets [ ] around a substance refer to the concentration of the enclosed species in moles per liter.

    Stronger acids have their equilibria toward the right and thus have larger acidity constants, whereas weaker
    acids have their equilibria toward the left and have smaller acidity constants. The range of Ka values for different
    acids is enormous, running from about 1015 for the strongest acids to about 10-60 for the weakest. Common
    inorganic acids such as H2SO4, HNO3, and HCl have Ka's in the range of 102 to 109, while organic acids generally
    have Ka's in the range of 10-5 to 10-15. As you gain experience, you'll develop a rough feeling for which acids are
    "strong" and which are "weak" (always remembering that the terms are relative, not absolute).

    Acid strengths are normally expressed using pKa values rather than Ka values, where the pKa is the negative
    common logarithm of the Ka:

    A stronger acid (larger Ka) has a smaller pKa, and a weaker acid (smaller Ka) has a larger pKa. TABLE 2.3 lists the
    pKa's of some common acids in order of their strength, and a more comprehensive table is given in Appendix B.

    Notice that the pKa value shown in TABLE 2.3 for water is 15.74, which results from the following calculation.
    Because water is both the acid and the solvent, the equilibrium expression is

    The numerator in this expression is the so-called ion-product constant for water, Kw = [H3O+][OH-] = 1.00 ×
    10-14, and the denominator is the molar concentration of pure water, [H2O] = 55.4 M at 25 °C. The calculation
    is artificial in that the concentration of "solvent" water is ignored while the concentration of "acid" water is not,
    but it is nevertheless useful for making a comparison of water with other weak acids on a similar footing.

    Notice also in TABLE 2.3 that there is an inverse relationship between the acid strength of an acid and the
    base strength of its conjugate base. A strong acid has a weak conjugate base, and a weak acid has a strong
    conjugate base. To understand this inverse relationship, think about what is happening to the acidic hydrogen
    in an acid-base reaction. A strong acid is one that loses H+ easily, meaning that its conjugate base holds the H+
    weakly and is therefore a weak base. A weak acid is one that loses H+ with difficulty, meaning that its conjugate
    base holds the proton tightly and is therefore a strong base. The fact that HCl is a strong acid, for example,
    means that Cl- does not hold H+ tightly and is thus a weak base. Water, on the other hand, is a weak acid,
    meaning that OH- holds H+ tightly and is a strong base.

2.9 Predicting Acid-Base Reactions from pKa Values

Compilations of pKa values like those in TABLE 2.3 and Appendix B are useful for predicting whether a given
acid-base reaction will take place, because H+ will always go from the stronger acid to the stronger base. That is,
an acid will donate a proton to the conjugate base of a weaker acid, and the conjugate base of a weaker acid will
remove a proton from a stronger acid. Since water (pKa = 15.74) is a weaker acid than acetic acid (pKa = 4.76),
for example, hydroxide ion holds a proton more tightly than acetate ion does. Hydroxide ion will therefore react
to a large extent with acetic acid, CH3CO2H, to yield acetate ion and H2O.
52  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    Another way to predict acid-base reactivity is to remember that the product conjugate acid in an acid-base
    reaction must be weaker and less reactive than the starting acid and the product conjugate base must be
    weaker and less reactive than the starting base. In the reaction of acetic acid with hydroxide ion, for example,
    the product conjugate acid (H2O) is weaker than the starting acid (CH3CO2H), and the product conjugate base
    (CH3CO2-) is weaker than the starting base (OH-).

            WORKED EXAMPLE 2.4

    Predicting Acid Strengths from pKa Values

    Water has pKa = 15.74, and acetylene has pKa = 25. Which is the stronger acid? Does hydroxide ion react to a
    significant extent with acetylene?

    Strategy
    In comparing two acids, the one with the lower pKa is stronger. Thus, water is a stronger acid than acetylene and
    gives up H+ more easily.

    Solution

    Because water is a stronger acid and gives up H+ more easily than acetylene, the HO- ion must have less affinity

    for H+ than the  ion. In other words, the anion of acetylene is a stronger base than hydroxide ion, and

    the reaction will not proceed significantly as written.

2.10 Organic Acids and Organic Bases

Many of the reactions we'll be seeing in future chapters, including practically all biological reactions, involve
organic acids and organic bases. Although it's too early to go into the details of these processes now, you might
keep the following generalities in mind:

Organic Acids

Organic acids are characterized by the presence of a positively polarized hydrogen atom (blue in electrostatic

potential maps) and are of two main kinds: acids such as methanol and acetic acid that contain a hydrogen

atom bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom (O-H) and those such as acetone (Section 2.5) that contain a

hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom next to a   bond (  ).

Methanol contains an O-H bond and is a weak acid, while acetic acid also contains an O-H bond and is a
somewhat stronger acid. In both cases, acidity is due to the fact that the conjugate base resulting from loss of H+

is stabilized by having its negative charge on a strongly electronegative oxygen atom. In addition, the conjugate

base of acetic acid is stabilized by resonance (Section 2.4 and Section 2.5).
54  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    The acidity of acetone and other compounds with   bonds is due to the fact that the conjugate base resulting

    from loss of H+ is stabilized by resonance. In addition, one of the resonance forms stabilizes the negative charge

    by placing it on an electronegative oxygen atom.

    Electrostatic potential maps of the conjugate bases from methanol, acetic acid, and acetone are shown in
    FIGURE 2.5. As you might expect, all three show a substantial amount of negative charge (red) on oxygen.

    FIGURE 2.5 Electrostatic potential maps of the conjugate bases of (a) methanol, (b) acetic acid, and (c) acetone. The electronegative
    oxygen atoms stabilize the negative charge in all three.

    Compounds called carboxylic acids, which contain the -CO2H grouping, occur abundantly in all living
    organisms and are involved in almost all metabolic pathways. Acetic acid, pyruvic acid, and citric acid are
    examples. You might note that at the typical pH of 7.3 found within cells, carboxylic acids are usually dissociated
    and exist as their carboxylate anions, -CO2-.

    Organic Bases

    Organic bases are characterized by the presence of an atom (reddish in electrostatic potential maps) with a
    lone pair of electrons that can bond to H+. Nitrogen-containing compounds such as methylamine are the most
    common organic bases and are involved in almost all metabolic pathways, but oxygen-containing compounds
    can also act as bases when reacting with a sufficiently strong acid. Note that some oxygen-containing
    compounds can act both as acids and as bases depending on the circumstances, just as water can. Methanol
    and acetone, for instance, act as acids when they donate a proton but as bases when their oxygen atom accepts
    a proton.

2.11 · Acids and Bases: The Lewis Definition                                                                        55

We'll see in Chapter 26 that substances called amino acids, so-named because they are both amines (-NH2)
and carboxylic acids (-CO2H), are the building blocks from which the proteins in all living organisms are made.
Twenty different amino acids go into making up proteins--alanine is an example. Interestingly, alanine and
other amino acids exist primarily in a doubly charged form called a zwitterion rather than in the uncharged
form. The zwitterion form arises because amino acids have both acidic and basic sites within the same molecule
and therefore undergo an internal acid-base reaction.

2.11 Acids and Bases: The Lewis Definition

The Lewis definition of acids and bases is more encompassing than the Brønsted-Lowry definition because it's
not limited to substances that donate or accept just protons. A Lewis acid is a substance that accepts an electron
pair, and a Lewis base is a substance that donates an electron pair. The donated electron pair is shared between
the acid and the base in a covalent bond.

Lewis Acids and the Curved Arrow Formalism

The fact that a Lewis acid is able to accept an electron pair means that it must have either a vacant, low-energy
orbital or a polar bond to hydrogen so that it can donate H+ (which has an empty 1s orbital). Thus, the Lewis
definition of acidity includes many species in addition to H+. For example, various metal cations, such as Mg2+,
are Lewis acids because they accept a pair of electrons when they form a bond to a base. We'll also see in later
chapters that certain metabolic reactions begin with an acid-base reaction between Mg2+ as a Lewis acid and
an organic diphosphate or triphosphate ion as the Lewis base.

In the same way, compounds of group 3A elements, such as BF3 and AlCl3, are Lewis acids because they have
56  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    unfilled valence orbitals and can accept electron pairs from Lewis bases, as shown in FIGURE 2.6. Similarly,
    many transition-metal compounds, such as TiCl4, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and SnCl4, are Lewis acids.

    FIGURE 2.6 The reaction of boron trifluoride, a Lewis acid, with dimethyl ether, a Lewis base. The Lewis acid accepts a pair of electrons,
    and the Lewis base donates a pair of nonbonding electrons. Note how the movement of electrons from the Lewis base to the Lewis acid is
    indicated by a curved arrow. Note also how, in electrostatic potential maps, the boron becomes more negative (red) after reaction because
    it has gained electrons and the oxygen atom becomes more positive (blue) because it has donated electrons.

    Look closely at the acid-base reaction in FIGURE 2.6, and notice how it's shown. Dimethyl ether, the Lewis base,
    donates an electron pair to a vacant valence orbital of the boron atom in BF3, a Lewis acid. The direction of
    electron-pair flow from base to acid is shown using a curved arrow, just as the direction of electron flow from
    one resonance structure to another was shown using curved arrows in Section 2.5. We'll use this curved-arrow
    notation throughout the remainder of this text to indicate electron flow during reactions, so get used to seeing
    it.
    Some further examples of Lewis acids follow:

    Lewis Bases

    The Lewis definition of a base--a compound with a pair of nonbonding electrons that it can use to bond to a
    Lewis acid--is similar to the Brønsted-Lowry definition. Thus, H2O, with its two pairs of nonbonding electrons

2.11 · Acids and Bases: The Lewis Definition                                                                       57

on oxygen, acts as a Lewis base by donating an electron pair to an H+ in forming the hydronium ion, H3O+.

In a more general sense, most oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organic compounds can act as Lewis bases
because they have lone pairs of electrons. A divalent oxygen compound has two lone pairs of electrons, and a
trivalent nitrogen compound has one lone pair. Note in the following examples that some compounds can act
as both acids and bases, just as water can. Alcohols and carboxylic acids, for instance, act as acids when they
donate an H+ but as bases when their oxygen atom accepts an H+.

Note also that some Lewis bases, such as carboxylic acids, esters, and amides, have more than one atom with a
lone pair of electrons and can therefore react at more than one site. Acetic acid, for example, can be protonated
either on the doubly bonded oxygen atom or on the singly bonded oxygen atom. Reaction normally occurs only
once in such instances, and the more stable of the two possible protonation products is formed. For acetic
acid, protonation by reaction with sulfuric acid occurs on the doubly bonded oxygen because that product is
stabilized by two resonance forms.

    2.12 Noncovalent Interactions between Molecules

    When thinking about chemical reactivity, chemists usually focus their attention on bonds, the covalent
    interactions between atoms within molecules. Also important, however, particularly in large biomolecules like
    proteins and nucleic acids, are a variety of interactions between molecules that strongly affect molecular
    properties. Collectively called either intermolecular forces, van der Waals forces, or noncovalent
    interactions, they are of several different types: dipole-dipole forces, dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds.

    Dipole-dipole forces occur between polar molecules as a result of electrostatic interactions among dipoles.
    The forces can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the orientation of the molecules--attractive when
    unlike charges are together and repulsive when like charges are together. The attractive geometry is lower in
    energy and therefore predominates (FIGURE 2.7).

    FIGURE 2.7 Dipole-dipole forces cause polar molecules (a) to attract one another when they orient with unlike charges together, but
    (b) to repel one another when they orient with like charges together.

    Dispersion forces occur between all neighboring molecules and arise because the electron distribution within
    molecules is constantly changing. Although uniform on a time-averaged basis, the electron distribution even in
    nonpolar molecules is likely to be nonuniform at any given instant. One side of a molecule may, by chance, have
    a slight excess of electrons relative to the opposite side, giving the molecule a temporary dipole. This temporary
    dipole in one molecule causes a nearby molecule to adopt a temporarily opposite dipole, resulting in a tiny
    attraction between the two (FIGURE 2.8). Temporary molecular dipoles have only a fleeting existence and are
    constantly changing, but their cumulative effect is often strong enough to hold molecules close together so that
    a substance is a liquid or solid rather than a gas.

FIGURE 2.8 Attractive dispersion forces in nonpolar molecules are caused by temporary dipoles, as shown in these models of pentane,
C5H12.

Perhaps the most important noncovalent interaction in biological molecules is the hydrogen bond, an attractive
interaction between a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative O or N atom and an unshared electron
pair on another O or N atom. In essence, a hydrogen bond is a very strong dipole-dipole interaction involving
polarized O-H or N-H bonds. Electrostatic potential maps of water and ammonia clearly show the positively
polarized hydrogens (blue) and the negatively polarized oxygens and nitrogens (red).

Hydrogen bonding has enormous consequences for living organisms. Hydrogen bonds cause water to be a
liquid rather than a gas at ordinary temperatures, they hold enzymes in the shapes necessary for catalyzing
biological reactions, and they cause strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to pair up and coil into the double
helix that stores genetic information.

One further point before leaving the subject of noncovalent interactions: biochemists frequently use the term
hydrophilic, meaning "water-loving," to describe a substance that is attracted to water and the term
hydrophobic, meaning "water-fearing," to describe a substance that is not strongly attracted to water.
60  2 · Polar Covalent Bonds; Acids and Bases

    Hydrophilic substances, such as table sugar, often have a number of -OH groups in their structure so they can
    form hydrogen bonds and dissolve in water, whereas hydrophobic substances, such as vegetable oil, do not have
    groups that form hydrogen bonds and do not dissolve in water.

    PROBLEM Of the two vitamins A and C, one is hydrophilic and water-soluble while the other is hydrophobic

     CHEMISTRY MATTERS

Alkaloids: From Cocaine to Dental Anesthetics

Just as ammonia (NH3) is a weak base, there are a large number of nitrogen-containing organic compounds
called amines that are also weak bases. In the early days of organic chemistry, basic amines derived from
natural sources were known as vegetable alkali, but they are now called alkaloids. More than 20,000 alkaloids
are known. Their study provided much of the impetus for the growth of organic chemistry in the nineteenth
century and remains today an active and fascinating area of research.

FIGURE 2.9 The coca bush Erythroxylon coca, native to upland rain forest areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and western Brazil, is
the source of the alkaloid cocaine. (credit: "Erythroxylum coca" by Danna Guevara/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)

Many alkaloids have pronounced biological properties, and approximately 50% of pharmaceutical agents used
today are derived from naturally occurring amines. As just three examples, morphine, an analgesic agent
(painkiller), is obtained from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. Ephedrine, a bronchodilator,
decongestant, and appetite suppressant, is obtained from Ephedra sinica, an evergreen shrub native to
Mongolia and northeastern China. Cocaine, both an anesthetic and a stimulant, is obtained from the coca bush
Erythroxylon coca, endemic to the upland rain forest areas of central South America. (And yes, there really was
a small amount of cocaine in the original Coca-Cola recipe, although it was removed in 1906.)

Cocaine itself is rarely used medically because it is too addictive, but its anesthetic properties provoked a
long search for related but nonaddictive compounds. This search ultimately resulted in the synthesis of the
"caine" anesthetics that are commonly used today in dental and surgical anesthesia. Procaine, the first such
compound, was synthesized in 1898 and marketed under the name Novocain. It was rapidly adopted and
remains in use today as a topical anesthetic. Other related compounds with different activity profiles followed:
Lidocaine, marketed as Xylocaine, was introduced in 1943, and mepivacaine (Carbocaine) in the early 1960s.
More recently, bupivacaine (Marcaine) and prilocaine (Citanest) have gained popularity. Both are quick-acting,
but the effects of bupivacaine last for 3 to 6 hours while those of prilocaine fade after 45 minutes. Notice some
structural similarity of all the caines to cocaine itself.
62 2 · Key Terms

An estimate from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences is that less than 1% of all living species have been
characterized. Thus, alkaloid chemistry remains an active area of research, and innumerable substances with
potentially useful properties have yet to be discovered. Undoubtedly even the caine anesthetics will become
obsolete at some point, perhaps supplanted by newly discovered alkaloids.

Summary

Understanding organic chemistry means knowing not just what happens but also why and how it happens
at the molecular level. In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account
for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be
discussed in subsequent chapters.

Organic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by
differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen
attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.
Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone
pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, .

Plus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.
Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of
the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.

Some substances, such as acetate ion and benzene, can't be represented by a single line-bond structure and
must be considered as a resonance hybrid of two or more structures, none of which would be correct by
themselves. The only difference between two resonance forms is in the location of their  and nonbonding
electrons. The nuclei remain in the same places in both structures, and the hybridization of the atoms remains

the same.
Acidity and basicity are closely related to the ideas of polarity and electronegativity. A Brønsted-Lowry acid is
a compound that can donate a proton (hydrogen ion, H+), and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a compound that can
accept a proton. The strength of a Brønsted-Lowry acid or base is expressed by its acidity constant, Ka, or by
the negative logarithm of the acidity constant, pKa. The larger the pKa, the weaker the acid. More useful is the
Lewis definition of acids and bases. A Lewis acid is a compound that has a low-energy empty orbital that can
accept an electron pair; Mg2+, BF3, AlCl3, and H+ are examples. A Lewis base is a compound that can donate an
unshared electron pair; NH3 and H2O are examples. Most organic molecules that contain oxygen and nitrogen
can act as Lewis bases toward sufficiently strong acids.
A variety of noncovalent interactions have a significant effect on the properties of large biomolecules.
Hydrogen bonding--the attractive interaction between a positively polarized hydrogen atom bonded to an
oxygen or nitrogen atom with an unshared electron pair on another O or N atom, is particularly important in
giving proteins and nucleic acids their shapes.

    whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of
    this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.

    3.1 Functional Groups

    The structural features that make it possible to classify compounds into families are called functional groups. A
    functional group is a group of atoms within a molecule that has a characteristic chemical behavior. Chemically,
    a given functional group behaves in nearly the same way in every molecule it's a part of. For example, compare
    ethylene, a plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, with menthene, a much more complicated molecule found
    in peppermint oil. Both substances contain a carbon-carbon double-bond functional group, and both therefore
    react with Br2 in the same way to give a product in which a Br atom has added to each of the double-bond
    carbons (FIGURE 3.2). This example is typical: the chemistry of every organic molecule, regardless of size and
    complexity, is determined by the functional groups it contains.

    FIGURE 3.2 The reactions of ethylene and menthene with bromine. In both molecules, the carbon-carbon double-bond functional group
    has a similar polarity pattern, so both molecules react with Br2 in the same way. The size and complexity of the molecules are not important.

    Look at TABLE 3.1, which lists many of the common functional groups and gives simple examples of their
    occurrence. Some functional groups have only carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; others have halogen
    atoms; and still others contain oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Much of the chemistry you'll be studying is the
    chemistry of these functional groups.

    Functional Groups with Carbon-Carbon Multiple Bonds

    Alkenes, alkynes, and arenes (aromatic compounds) all contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Alkenes have
    a double bond, alkynes have a triple bond, and arenes have alternating double and single bonds in a six-
    membered ring of carbon atoms. They look different, but because of their structural similarities, they also have
    chemical similarities.

Functional Groups with Carbon Singly Bonded to an Electronegative Atom

Alkyl halides (haloalkanes), alcohols, ethers, alkyl phosphates, amines, thiols, sulfides, and disulfides all have
a carbon atom singly bonded to an electronegative atom--halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Alkyl halides
have a carbon atom bonded to halogen (-X), alcohols have a carbon atom bonded to the oxygen of a hydroxyl
group (-OH), ethers have two carbon atoms bonded to the same oxygen, organophosphates have a carbon atom
bonded to the oxygen of a phosphate group (-OPO32-), amines have a carbon atom bonded to a nitrogen, thiols
have a carbon atom bonded to the sulfur of an -SH group, sulfides have two carbon atoms bonded to the same
sulfur, and disulfides have carbon atoms bonded to two sulfurs that are joined together. In all cases, the bonds
are polar, with the carbon atom bearing a partial positive charge (+) and the electronegative atom bearing a
partial negative charge (-).

    Functional Groups with a Carbon-Oxygen Double Bond (Carbonyl Groups)

    The carbonyl group,              (pronounced car-bo-neel) is common to many of the families listed in TABLE 3.1.

    Carbonyl groups are present in a majority of organic compounds and in practically all biological molecules.

    These compounds therefore behave similarly in many respects but differ depending on the identity of the

    other atoms bonded to the carbonyl-group carbon. Aldehydes have at least one hydrogen bonded to the  ,

    ketones have two carbons bonded to the     , carboxylic acids have an -OH group bonded to the     , esters

    have an ether-like oxygen bonded to the    , thioesters have a sulfide-like sulfur bonded to the  , amides

    have an amine-like nitrogen bonded to the  , acid chlorides have a chlorine bonded to the         , and so

    on. In all these functional groups, the carbonyl carbon atom bears a partial positive charge (+), and the oxygen

    bears a partial negative charge (-).

    3.2 Alkanes and Alkane Isomers

    Before beginning a systematic study of the different functional groups, let's look first at the simplest family of
    molecules to develop some general ideas that apply to all families. We saw in Section 1.7 that the carbon-carbon
    single bond in ethane results from  (head-on) overlap of carbon sp3 hybrid orbitals. If we imagine joining three,
    four, five, or even more carbon atoms by C-C single bonds, we can generate the large family of molecules called
    alkanes.

    Alkanes are often described as saturated hydrocarbons: hydrocarbons because they contain only carbon and
    hydrogen; saturated because they have only C-C and C-H single bonds and thus contain the maximum possible
    number of hydrogens per carbon. They have the general formula CnH2n+2, where n is an integer. Alkanes are
    also occasionally called aliphatic compounds, a name derived from the Greek aleiphas, meaning "fat." We'll see
    in Section 27.1 that many animal fats contain long carbon chains similar to alkanes.

    Think about the ways that carbon and hydrogen might combine to make alkanes. With one carbon and four

    hydrogens, only one structure is possible: methane, CH4. Similarly, there is only one combination of two
    carbons with six hydrogens (ethane, CH3CH3) and only one combination of three carbons with eight hydrogens
    (propane, CH3CH2CH3). When larger numbers of carbons and hydrogens combine, however, more than one
    structure is possible. For example, there are two substances with the formula C4H10: the four carbons can all
    be in a row (butane), or they can branch (isobutane). Similarly, there are three C5H12 molecules, and so on for
    larger alkanes.

Compounds like butane and pentane, whose carbons are all connected in a row, are called straight-chain
alkanes, or normal alkanes. Compounds like 2-methylpropane (isobutane), 2-methylbutane, and
2,2-dimethylpropane, whose carbon chains branch, are called branched-chain alkanes.

Compounds like the two C4H10 molecules and the three C5H12 molecules, which have the same formula but
different structures, are called Isomers, from the Greek isos + meros, meaning "made of the same parts."
Isomers have the same numbers and kinds of atoms but differ in the way the atoms are arranged. Compounds
like butane and isobutane, whose atoms are connected differently, are called constitutional isomers. We'll see
shortly that other kinds of isomers are also possible, even among compounds whose atoms are connected in
the same order. As TABLE 3.2 shows, the number of possible alkane isomers increases dramatically with the
number of carbon atoms.

80  3 · Organic Compounds: Alkanes and Their Stereochemistry

    Constitutional isomerism is not limited to alkanes--it occurs widely throughout organic chemistry.
    Constitutional isomers may have different carbon skeletons (as in isobutane and butane), different functional
    groups (as in ethanol and dimethyl ether), or different locations of a functional group along the chain (as
    in isopropylamine and propylamine). Regardless of the reason for the isomerism, constitutional isomers are
    always different compounds with different properties but with the same formula.

    A given alkane can be drawn in many ways. For example, the straight-chain, four-carbon alkane called butane
    can be represented by any of the structures shown in FIGURE 3.3. These structures don't imply any particular
    three-dimensional geometry for butane; they indicate only the connections among atoms. In practice, as noted
    in Section 1.12, chemists rarely draw all the bonds in a molecule and usually refer to butane by the condensed
    structure, CH3CH2CH2CH3 or CH3(CH2)2CH3. Still more simply, butane can be represented as n-C4H10, where
    n denotes normal (straight-chain) butane.

    FIGURE 3.3 Some representations of butane, C4H10. The molecule is the same regardless of how it's drawn. These structures imply only
    that butane has a continuous chain of four carbon atoms; they do not imply any specific geometry.

    Straight-chain alkanes are named according to the number of carbon atoms they contain, as shown in TABLE
    3.3. With the exception of the first four compounds--methane, ethane, propane, and butane--whose names have
    historical roots, the alkanes are named based on Greek numbers. The suffix -ane is added to the end of each
    name to indicate that the molecule identified is an alkane. Thus, pentane is the five-carbon alkane, hexane is
    the six-carbon alkane, and so on. We'll soon see that these alkane names form the basis for naming all other
    organic compounds, so at least the first ten should be memorized.

3.3 Alkyl Groups

If you imagine removing a hydrogen atom from an alkane, the partial structure that remains is called an alkyl
group. Alkyl groups are not stable compounds themselves, they are simply parts of larger compounds and
are named by replacing the -ane ending of the parent alkane with an -yl ending. For example, removal of
a hydrogen from methane, CH4, generates a methyl group, -CH3, and removal of a hydrogen from ethane,
CH3CH3, generates an ethyl group, -CH2CH3. Similarly, removal of a hydrogen atom from the end carbon of any
straight-chain alkane gives the series of straight-chain alkyl groups shown in TABLE 3.4. Combining an alkyl
group with any of the functional groups listed earlier makes it possible to generate and name many thousands
of compounds. For example:

    Just as straight-chain alkyl groups are generated by removing a hydrogen from an end carbon, branched alkyl
    groups are generated by removing a hydrogen atom from an internal carbon. Two 3-carbon alkyl groups and
    four 4-carbon alkyl groups are possible (FIGURE 3.4).

One further comment about naming alkyl groups: the prefixes sec- (for secondary) and tert- (for tertiary) used
for the C4 alkyl groups in FIGURE 3.4 refer to the number of other carbon atoms attached to the branching
carbon atom. There are four possibilities: primary (1°), secondary (2°), tertiary (3°), and quaternary (4°).

The symbol R is used here and throughout organic chemistry to represent a generalized organic group. The R
group can be methyl, ethyl, propyl, or any of a multitude of others. You might think of R as representing the Rest
of the molecule, which isn't specified.
The terms primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary are routinely used in organic chemistry, and their
meanings need to become second nature. For example, if we were to say, "Citric acid is a tertiary alcohol," we
would mean that it has an alcohol functional group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom that is itself bonded to three
other carbons.
84  3 · Organic Compounds: Alkanes and Their Stereochemistry

    In addition to speaking of carbon atoms as being primary, secondary, or tertiary, we speak of hydrogens in

    the same way. Primary hydrogen atoms are attached to primary carbons (RCH3), secondary hydrogens are
    attached to secondary carbons (R2CH2), and tertiary hydrogens are attached to tertiary carbons (R3CH). There
    is, however, no such thing as a quaternary hydrogen. (Why not?)

    3.4 Naming Alkanes

    In earlier times, when relatively few pure organic chemicals were known, new compounds were named at
    the whim of their discoverer. Thus, urea (CH4N2O) is a crystalline substance isolated from urine; morphine
    (C17H19NO3) is an analgesic (painkiller) named after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams; and acetic acid, the
    primary organic constituent of vinegar, is named from the Latin word for vinegar, acetum.

    As the science of organic chemistry slowly grew in the 19th century, so too did the number of known compounds
    and the need for a systematic method of naming them. The system of naming (nomenclature) we'll use in
    this book is that devised by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC, usually spoken as
    eye-you-pac).

    A chemical name typically has four parts in the IUPAC system: parent, prefix, locant, and suffix. The parent
    name identifies the main part of the molecule and tells how many carbon atoms are in that part. Prefixes
    identify the various substituent groups attached to the parent. Locants give the positions of the attached
    substituents. And the suffix identifies the primary functional group attached to the parent.

    As we cover new functional groups in later chapters, the applicable IUPAC rules of nomenclature will be given.
    In addition, Appendix A at the back of this book gives an overall view of organic nomenclature and shows how
    compounds that contain more than one functional group are named. (If preferred, you can study that appendix
    now.) For the present, let's see how to name branched-chain alkanes and learn some general rules that are
    applicable to all compounds.
    All but the most complex branched-chain alkanes can be named by following four steps. For a very few
    compounds, a fifth step is needed.

STEP 1
Identify the parent hydrocarbon.

(a) Find the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule, and use the name of that chain as the
parent name. The longest chain may not always be apparent from the manner of writing; you may have to "turn
corners."

(b) If two different chains of equal length are present, choose the one with the larger number of branch points
as the parent.

STEP 2
Number the atoms in the longest chain.
(a) Beginning at the end nearer the first branch point, number each carbon atom in the parent chain.

The first branch occurs at C3 in the proper system of numbering, not at C4.
(b) If there is branching an equal distance away from both ends of the parent chain, begin numbering at the end
nearer the second branch point.

STEP 3
Identify and number the substituents.
(a) Assign a number to each substituent to locate its point of attachment to the parent chain.

(b) If there are two substituents on the same carbon, give both the same number. There must be as many
numbers in the name as there are substituents.
86  3 · Organic Compounds: Alkanes and Their Stereochemistry

    STEP 4
    Write the name as a single word.

    Use hyphens to separate the different prefixes, and use commas to separate numbers. If two or more different
    substituents are present, cite them in alphabetical order. If two or more identical substituents are present on
    the parent chain, use one of the multiplier prefixes di-, tri-, tetra-, and so forth, but don't use these prefixes for
    alphabetizing. Full names for some of the examples we have been using are as follows:

    STEP 5
    Name a branched substituent as though it were itself a compound.
    In some particularly complex cases, a fifth step is necessary. It occasionally happens that a substituent on the
    main chain is itself branched. In the following case, for instance, the substituent at C6 is a three-carbon chain
    with a methyl group. To name the compound fully, the branched substituent must first be named.

    Number the branched substituent beginning at the point of its attachment to the main chain, and identify it--in
    this case, a 2-methylpropyl group. The substituent is treated as a whole and is alphabetized according to the
    first letter of its complete name, including any numerical prefix. It is set off in parentheses when naming the
    entire molecule.

    As a further example:

For historical reasons, some of the simpler branched-chain alkyl groups also have nonsystematic, common
names, as noted earlier.

The common names of these simple alkyl groups are so well entrenched in the chemical literature that IUPAC
rules make allowance for them. Thus, the following compound is properly named either
4-(1-methylethyl)heptane or 4-isopropylheptane. There's no choice but to memorize these common names;
fortunately, there are only a few of them.

When writing an alkane name, the nonhyphenated prefix iso- is considered part of the alkyl-group name for
alphabetizing purposes, but the hyphenated and italicized prefixes sec- and tert- are not. Thus, isopropyl and
isobutyl are listed alphabetically under i, but sec-butyl and tert-butyl are listed under b.

3.5 Properties of Alkanes

Alkanes are sometimes referred to as paraffins, a word derived from the Latin parum affinis, meaning "little
affinity." This term aptly describes their behavior, for alkanes show little chemical affinity for other substances
and are chemically inert to most laboratory reagents. They are also relatively inert biologically and are not often
involved in the chemistry of living organisms. Alkanes do, however, react with oxygen, halogens, and a few other
substances under appropriate conditions.
Reaction with oxygen occurs during combustion in an engine or furnace when an alkane is used as a fuel.
Carbon dioxide and water are formed as products, and a large amount of heat is released. For example, methane
(natural gas) reacts with oxygen according to the equation

The reaction of an alkane with Cl2 occurs when a mixture of the two is irradiated with ultraviolet light (denoted
h, where  is the Greek letter nu). Depending on the time allowed and the relative amounts of the two reactants,
a sequential substitution of the alkane hydrogen atoms by chlorine occurs, leading to a mixture of chlorinated
products. Methane, for instance, reacts with Cl2 to yield a mixture of CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CCl4. We'll look
at this reaction in more detail in Section 6.6.

Alkanes show regular increases in both boiling point and melting point as molecular weight increases (FIGURE
3.5), an effect due to the presence of weak dispersion forces between molecules (Section 2.12). Only when
sufficient energy is applied to overcome these forces does the solid melt or liquid boil. As you might expect,
dispersion forces increase as molecular size increases, accounting for the higher melting and boiling points of
larger alkanes.
90  3 · Organic Compounds: Alkanes and Their Stereochemistry

    FIGURE 3.5 A plot of melting and boiling points versus number of carbon atoms for the C1-C14 straight-chain alkanes. There is a
    regular increase with molecular size.

    Another effect seen in alkanes is that increased branching lowers an alkane's boiling point. Thus, pentane
    has no branches and boils at 36.1 °C, isopentane (2-methylbutane) has one branch and boils at 27.85 °C, and
    neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) has two branches and boils at 9.5 °C. Similarly, octane boils at 125.7 °C,
    whereas isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) boils at 99.3 °C. Branched-chain alkanes are lower-boiling because
    they are more nearly spherical than straight-chain alkanes, have smaller surface areas, and consequently have
    smaller dispersion forces.

    3.6 Conformations of Ethane

    Up until now, we've viewed molecules primarily in a two-dimensional way and have given little thought to any
    consequences that might arise from the spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules. Now it's time to add a third
    dimension to our study. Stereochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the three-dimensional
    aspects of molecules. We'll see on many occasions in future chapters that the exact three-dimensional structure
    of a molecule is often crucial to determining its properties and biological behavior.
    We know from Section 1.5 that  bonds are cylindrically symmetrical. In other words, the intersection of a plane
    cutting through a carbon-carbon single-bond orbital looks like a circle. Because of this cylindrical symmetry,
    rotation is possible around carbon-carbon bonds in open-chain molecules. In ethane, for instance, rotation
    around the C-C bond occurs freely, constantly changing the spatial relationships between the hydrogens on one
    carbon and those on the other (FIGURE 3.6).

               FIGURE 3.6 Rotation occurs around the carbon-carbon single bond in ethane because of  bond cylindrical symmetry.

    The different arrangements of atoms that result from bond rotation are called conformations, and molecules
    that have different arrangements are called conformational isomers, or conformers. Unlike constitutional
    isomers, however, different conformers often can't be isolated because they interconvert too rapidly.
    Conformational isomers are represented in two ways, as shown in FIGURE 3.7. A sawhorse representation
    views the carbon-carbon bond from an oblique angle and indicates spatial orientation by showing all C-H
    bonds. A Newman projection views the carbon-carbon bond directly end-on and represents the two carbon
    atoms by a circle. Bonds attached to the front carbon are represented by lines to the center of the circle, and
    bonds attached to the rear carbon are represented by lines to the edge of the circle.

FIGURE 3.7 A sawhorse representation and a Newman projection of ethane. The sawhorse representation views the molecule from an
oblique angle, while the Newman projection views the molecule end-on. Note that the molecular model of the Newman projection appears
at first to have six atoms attached to a single carbon. Actually, the front carbon, with three attached green atoms, is directly in front of the
rear carbon, with three attached red atoms.

Despite what we've just said, we actually don't observe perfectly free rotation in ethane. Experiments show
that there is a small (12 kJ/mol; 2.9 kcal/mol) barrier to rotation and that some conformations are more stable
than others. The lowest-energy, most stable conformation is the one in which all six C-H bonds are as far
away from one another as possible--staggered when viewed end-on in a Newman projection. The highest-
energy, least stable conformation is the one in which the six C-H bonds are as close as possible--eclipsed in
a Newman projection. At any given instant, about 99% of ethane molecules have an approximately staggered
conformation and only about 1% are near the eclipsed conformation.

The extra 12 kJ/mol of energy present in the eclipsed conformation of ethane is called torsional strain. Its cause
has been the subject of controversy, but the major factor is an interaction between C-H bonding orbitals on one
carbon and antibonding orbitals on the adjacent carbon, which stabilizes the staggered conformation relative
to the eclipsed one. Because a total strain of 12 kJ/mol arises from three equal hydrogen-hydrogen eclipsing
interactions, we can assign a value of approximately 4.0 kJ/mol (1.0 kcal/mol) to each single interaction. The
barrier to rotation that results can be represented on a graph of potential energy versus degree of rotation,
in which the angle between C-H bonds on the front and back carbons as viewed end-on (the dihedral angle)
goes full circle from 0 to 360°. Energy minima occur at staggered conformations, and energy maxima occur at
eclipsed conformations, as shown in FIGURE 3.8.
92  3 · Organic Compounds: Alkanes and Their Stereochemistry

    FIGURE 3.8 A graph of potential energy versus bond rotation in ethane. The staggered conformations are 12 kJ/mol lower in energy than
    the eclipsed conformations.

    3.7 Conformations of Other Alkanes

    Propane, the next-higher member in the alkane series, also has a torsional barrier that results in hindered
    rotation around the carbon-carbon bonds. The barrier is slightly higher in propane than in ethane--a total of 14
    kJ/mol (3.4 kcal/mol) versus 12 kJ/mol.
    The eclipsed conformation of propane has three interactions--two ethane-type hydrogen-hydrogen
    interactions and one additional hydrogen-methyl interaction. Since each eclipsing H  H interaction is the
    same as that in ethane and thus has an energy "cost" of 4.0 kJ/mol, we can assign a value of 14 - (2 × 4.0) = 6.0
    kJ/mol (1.4 kcal/mol) to the eclipsing H  CH3 interaction (FIGURE 3.9).

    FIGURE 3.9 Newman projections of propane showing staggered and eclipsed conformations. The staggered conformer is lower in energy
    by 14 kJ/mol.

    The conformational situation becomes more complex for larger alkanes because not all staggered
    conformations have the same energy and not all eclipsed conformations have the same energy. In butane, for
    instance, the lowest-energy arrangement, called the anti conformation, is the one in which the two methyl
    groups are as far apart as possible--180° away from each other. As rotation around the C2-C3 bond occurs,
    an eclipsed conformation is reached where there are two CH3  H interactions and one H  H interaction.
    Using the energy values derived previously from ethane and propane, this eclipsed conformation is more
    strained than the anti conformation by 2 × 6.0 kJ/mol + 4.0 kJ/mol (two CH3  H interactions plus one H  H
    interaction), for a total of 16 kJ/mol (3.8 kcal/mol).

3.7 · Conformations of Other Alkanes                                                                                93

As bond rotation continues, an energy minimum is reached at the staggered conformation where the methyl
groups are 60° apart. Called the gauche conformation, it lies 3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol) higher in energy than
the anti conformation even though it has no eclipsing interactions. This energy difference occurs because the
hydrogen atoms of the methyl groups are near one another in the gauche conformation, resulting in what is
called steric strain. Steric strain is the repulsive interaction that occurs when atoms are forced closer together
than their atomic radii allow. It's the result of trying to force two atoms to occupy the same space.

As the dihedral angle between the methyl groups approaches zero, an energy maximum is reached at a second
eclipsed conformation. Because the methyl groups are forced even closer together than in the gauche
conformation, both torsional strain and steric strain are present. A total strain energy of 19 kJ/mol (4.5 kcal/
mol) has been estimated for this conformation, making it possible to calculate a value of 11 kJ/mol (2.6 kcal/
mol) for the CH3  CH3 eclipsing interaction: total strain of 19 kJ/mol minus the strain of two H  H eclipsing
interactions (2 × 4.0 kcal/mol) equals 11 kJ/mol.

After 0°, the rotation becomes a mirror image of what we've already seen: another gauche conformation is
reached, another eclipsed conformation, and finally a return to the anti conformation. A plot of potential energy
versus rotation about the C2-C3 bond is shown in FIGURE 3.10.

    FIGURE 3.10 A plot of potential energy versus rotation for the C2-C3 bond in butane. The energy maximum occurs when the two methyl
    groups eclipse each other, and the energy minimum occurs when the two methyl groups are 180° apart (anti).

    The notion of assigning definite energy values to specific interactions within a molecule is very useful, and we'll
    return to it in the next chapter. A summary of what we've seen thus far is given in TABLE 3.5.

    The same principles just developed for butane apply to pentane, hexane, and all higher alkanes. The most
    favorable conformation for any alkane has the carbon-carbon bonds in staggered arrangements, with large
    substituents arranged anti to one another. A generalized alkane structure is shown in FIGURE 3.11.

FIGURE 3.11 The most stable alkane conformation is the one in which all substituents are staggered and the carbon-carbon bonds are
arranged anti, as shown in this model of decane.

One final point: saying that one particular conformer is "more stable" than another doesn't mean the molecule
adopts and maintains only the more stable conformation. At room temperature, rotations around  bonds occur
so rapidly that all conformers are in equilibrium. At any given instant, however, a larger percentage of molecules
will be found in a more stable conformation than in a less stable one.

Gasoline

British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin once said that "The Kingdom of Heaven runs on righteousness, but
the Kingdom of Earth runs on alkanes." (Actually, he said "runs on oil" not "runs on alkanes," but they're
essentially the same.) By far, the major sources of alkanes are the world's natural gas and petroleum deposits.
Laid down eons ago, these deposits are thought to be derived primarily from the decomposition of tiny single-
celled marine organisms called foraminifera. Natural gas consists chiefly of methane but also contains ethane,
propane, and butane. Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that must be separated into fractions
and then further refined before it can be used.

FIGURE 3.12 Gasoline is a finite resource. It won't be around forever. (credit: "The first oil well" (https://www.loc.gov/item/
2010649522/) by Unknown/Library of Congress)

The petroleum era began in August 1859, when the world's first oil well was drilled by Edwin Drake near
Titusville, Pennsylvania. The petroleum was distilled into fractions according to boiling point, but it was high-
boiling kerosene, or lamp oil, rather than gasoline that was primarily sought. Literacy was becoming
widespread at the time, and people wanted better light for reading than was available from candles. Gasoline
was too volatile for use in lamps and was initially considered a waste by-product. The world has changed greatly
since those early days, however, and it is now gasoline rather than lamp oil that is prized.
Petroleum refining begins by fractional distillation of crude oil into three principal cuts according to boiling
point (bp): straight-run gasoline (bp 30-200 °C), kerosene (bp 175-300 °C), and heating oil, or diesel fuel (bp
275-400 °C). Further distillation under reduced pressure then yields lubricating oils and waxes and leaves
a tarry residue of asphalt. The distillation of crude oil is only the first step in gasoline production, however.
Straight-run gasoline turns out to be a poor fuel in automobiles because of engine knock, an uncontrolled
combustion that can occur in a hot engine causing potentially serious damage.
98 3 · Key Terms

The octane number of a fuel is the measure by which its antiknock properties are judged. It was recognized
long ago that straight-chain hydrocarbons are far more prone to inducing engine knock than highly branched
compounds. Heptane, a particularly bad fuel, is assigned a base value of 0 octane number, and
2,2,4-trimethylpentane, commonly known as isooctane, has a rating of 100.

Because straight-run gasoline burns so poorly in engines, petroleum chemists have devised numerous methods
for producing higher-quality fuels. One of these methods, catalytic cracking, involves taking the high-boiling
kerosene cut (C11-C14) and "cracking" it into smaller branched molecules suitable for use in gasoline. Another
process, called reforming, is used to convert C6-C8 alkanes to aromatic compounds such as benzene and
toluene, which have substantially higher octane numbers than alkanes. The final product that goes in your tank

has an approximate composition of 15% C4-C8 straight-chain alkanes, 25% to 40% C4-C10 branched-chain
alkanes, 10% cyclic alkanes, 10% straight-chain and cyclic alkenes, and 25% arenes (aromatics).

Summary

Alkanes are relatively unreactive and rarely involved in chemical reactions, but they nevertheless provide a
useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we've used alkanes to introduce
the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional
aspects of molecules.

A functional group is a group of atoms within a larger molecule that has a characteristic chemical reactivity.
Because functional groups behave in approximately the same way in all molecules where they occur, the
chemical reactions of an organic molecule are largely determined by its functional groups.

Alkanes are a class of saturated hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2. They contain no functional
groups, are relatively inert, and can be either straight-chain (normal) or branched. Alkanes are named by

a series of IUPAC rules of nomenclature. Compounds that have the same chemical formula but different

structures are called isomers. More specifically, compounds such as butane and isobutane, which differ in their
connections between atoms, are called constitutional isomers.

Carbon-carbon single bonds in alkanes are formed by  overlap of carbon sp3 hybrid orbitals. Rotation is
possible around  bonds because of their cylindrical symmetry, and alkanes therefore exist in a large number
of rapidly interconverting conformations. Newman projections make it possible to visualize the spatial
consequences of bond rotation by sighting directly along a carbon-carbon bond axis. Not all alkane
conformations are equally stable. The staggered conformation of ethane is 12 kJ/mol (2.9 kcal/mol) more
stable than the eclipsed conformation because of torsional strain. In general, any alkane is most stable when
all its bonds are staggered.

Although we've only discussed open-chain compounds up to now, most organic compounds contain rings
of carbon atoms. Chrysanthemic acid, for instance, whose esters occur naturally as the active insecticidal
constituents of chrysanthemum flowers, contains a three-membered (cyclopropane) ring.

     membered. We'll discuss steroids and their properties in more detail in Sections 27.6 and 27.7.

     4.1 Naming Cycloalkanes

     Saturated cyclic hydrocarbons are called cycloalkanes, or alicyclic compounds (aliphatic cyclic). Because
     cycloalkanes consist of rings of -CH2-units, they have the general formula (CH2)n, or CnH2n, and can be
     represented by polygons in skeletal drawings.

     Substituted cycloalkanes are named by rules similar to those we saw in (Section 3.4) for open-chain alkanes.
     For most compounds, there are only two steps.
     STEP 1
     Find the parent.
     Count the number of carbon atoms in the ring and the number in the largest substituent. If the number of
     carbon atoms in the ring is equal to or greater than the number in the substituent, the compound is named as
     an alkyl-substituted cycloalkane. If the number of carbon atoms in the largest substituent is greater than the
     number in the ring, the compound is named as a cycloalkyl-substituted alkane. For example:

STEP 2
Number the substituents, and write the name.
For an alkyl- or halo-substituted cycloalkane, choose a point of attachment as carbon 1 and number the
substituents on the ring so that the second substituent has as low a number as possible. If ambiguity still exists,
number so that the third or fourth substituent has as low a number as possible, until a point of difference is
found.

(a) When two or more different alkyl groups are present that could potentially take the same numbers, number
them by alphabetical priority, ignoring numerical prefixes such as di- and tri-.

(b) If halogens are present, treat them just like alkyl groups.

     4.2 Cis-Trans Isomerism in Cycloalkanes

     In many respects, the chemistry of cycloalkanes is like that of open-chain alkanes: both are nonpolar and fairly
     inert. There are, however, some important differences. One difference is that cycloalkanes are less flexible than
     open-chain alkanes. In contrast with the relatively free rotation around single bonds in open-chain alkanes
     (Section 3.6 and Section 3.7), there is much less freedom in cycloalkanes. Cyclopropane, for example, must be a
     rigid, planar molecule because three points (the carbon atoms) define a plane. No bond rotation can take place
     around a cyclopropane carbon-carbon bond without breaking open the ring (FIGURE 4.2).

     FIGURE 4.2 Bond rotation in ethane and cyclopropane. (a) Rotation occurs around the carbon-carbon bond in ethane, but (b) no rotation
     is possible around the carbon-carbon bonds in cyclopropane without breaking open the ring.

     Larger cycloalkanes have increasing rotational freedom, and very large rings (C25 and up) are so floppy that they
     are nearly indistinguishable from open-chain alkanes. The common ring sizes (C3-C7), however, are severely
     restricted in their molecular motions.

4.2 · Cis-Trans Isomerism in Cycloalkanes                                                                                               109

Because of their cyclic structures, cycloalkanes have two faces when viewed edge-on, a "top" face and a
"bottom" face. As a result, isomerism is possible in substituted cycloalkanes. For example, there are two
different 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane isomers, one with the two methyl groups on the same face of the ring and
one with the methyl groups on opposite faces (FIGURE 4.3). Both isomers are stable compounds, and neither
can be converted into the other without breaking and reforming chemical bonds.

FIGURE 4.3 There are two different 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane isomers, one with the methyl groups on the same face of the ring (cis) and
the other with the methyl groups on opposite faces of the ring (trans). The two isomers do not interconvert.

Unlike the constitutional isomers butane and isobutane, which have their atoms connected in a different order
(Section 3.2), the two 1,2-dimethylcyclopropanes have the same order of connections but differ in the spatial
orientation of the atoms. Such compounds, with atoms connected in the same order but differing in three-
dimensional orientation, are called stereochemical isomers, or stereoisomers. As we saw in Section 3.6, the
term stereochemistry is used generally to refer to the three-dimensional aspects of structure and reactivity.

The 1,2-dimethylcyclopropanes are members of a subclass of stereoisomers called cis-trans isomers. The
prefixes cis- (Latin "on the same side") and trans- (Latin "across") are used to distinguish between them.
Cis-trans isomerism is a common occurrence in substituted cycloalkanes and in many cyclic biological
molecules.

     4.3 Stability of Cycloalkanes: Ring Strain

     Chemists in the late 1800s knew that cyclic molecules existed, but the limitations on ring size were unclear.
     Although numerous compounds containing five-membered and six-membered rings were known, smaller and
     larger ring sizes had not been prepared, despite many attempts.

     A theoretical interpretation of this observation was proposed in 1885 by Adolf von Baeyer, who suggested that
     small and large rings might be unstable due to angle strain--the strain induced in a molecule when bond
     angles are forced to deviate from the ideal 109° tetrahedral value. Baeyer based his suggestion on the simple
     geometric notion that a three-membered ring (cyclopropane) should be an equilateral triangle with bond angles
     of 60° rather than 109°, a four-membered ring (cyclobutane) should be a square with bond angles of 90°, a five-
     membered ring should be a regular pentagon with bond angles of 108°, and so on. Continuing this argument,
     large rings should be strained by having bond angles that are much greater than 109°.

4.3 · Stability of Cycloalkanes: Ring Strain                                                                                           111

What are the facts? To measure the amount of strain in a compound, we have to measure the total energy of the
compound and then subtract the energy of a strain-free reference compound. The difference between the two
values should represent the amount of extra energy in the molecule due to strain. The simplest experimental
way to do this for a cycloalkane is to measure its heat of combustion, the amount of heat released when the
compound burns completely with oxygen. The more energy (strain) the compound contains, the more energy
(heat) is released by combustion.

Because the heat of combustion of a cycloalkane depends on size, we need to look at heats of combustion per
CH2 unit. Subtracting a reference value derived from a strain-free acyclic alkane and then multiplying by the
number of CH2 units in the ring gives the overall strain energy. FIGURE 4.4 shows the results.

FIGURE 4.4 Cycloalkane strain energies, as calculated by taking the difference between cycloalkane heat of combustion per CH2 and
acyclic alkane heat of combustion per CH2, and multiplying by the number of CH2 units in a ring. Small and medium rings are strained,
but cyclohexane rings and very large rings are strain-free.

The data in FIGURE 4.4 show that Baeyer's theory is only partially correct. Cyclopropane and cyclobutane are
indeed strained, just as predicted, but cyclopentane is more strained than predicted, and cyclohexane is strain-
free. Cycloalkanes of intermediate size have only modest strain, and rings of 14 carbons or more are strain-free.
Why is Baeyer's theory wrong?

Baeyer's theory is wrong for the simple reason that he assumed all cycloalkanes to be flat. In fact, as we'll see in
the next section, most cycloalkanes are not flat; instead, they adopt puckered three-dimensional conformations
that allow bond angles to be nearly tetrahedral. As a result, angle strain occurs only in three- and four-
membered rings, which have little flexibility. For most ring sizes, particularly the medium-ring (C7-C11)
cycloalkanes, torsional strain caused by H  H eclipsing interactions at adjacent carbons (Section 3.6) and
steric strain caused by the repulsion between nonbonded atoms that approach too closely (Section 3.7) are the
most important factors. Thus, three kinds of strain contribute to the overall energy of a cycloalkane.

  · Angle strain--the strain due to expansion or compression of bond angles
  · Torsional strain--the strain due to eclipsing of bonds between neighboring atoms
  · Steric strain--the strain due to repulsive interactions when atoms approach each other too closely

     4.4 Conformations of Cycloalkanes

     Cyclopropane

     Cyclopropane is the most strained of all rings, primarily due to the angle strain caused by its 60° C-C-C bond
     angles. In addition, cyclopropane has considerable torsional strain because the C-H bonds on neighboring
     carbon atoms are eclipsed (FIGURE 4.5).

     FIGURE 4.5 The structure of cyclopropane, showing the eclipsing of neighboring C-H bonds that gives rise to torsional strain. Part (b)
     is a Newman projection along a C-C bond.

     How can the hybrid-orbital model of bonding account for the large distortion of bond angles from the normal
     109° tetrahedral value to 60° in cyclopropane? The answer is that cyclopropane has bent bonds. In an
     unstrained alkane, maximum bonding is achieved when two atoms have their overlapping orbitals pointing
     directly toward each other. In cyclopropane, though, the orbitals can't point directly toward each other; instead,
     they overlap at a slight angle. The result is that cyclopropane bonds are weaker and more reactive than typical
     alkane bonds--255 kJ/mol (61 kcal/mol) for a C-C bond in cyclopropane versus 370 kJ/mol (88 kcal/mol) for a
     C-C bond in open-chain propane.

     Cyclobutane

     Cyclobutane has less angle strain than cyclopropane but has more torsional strain because of its larger number
     of ring hydrogens. As a result, the total strain for the two compounds is nearly the same--110 kJ/mol (26.4 kcal/
     mol) for cyclobutane versus 115 kJ/mol (27.5 kcal/mol) for cyclopropane. Cyclobutane is not quite flat but is
     slightly bent so that one carbon atom lies about 25° above the plane of the other three (FIGURE 4.6). The effect
     of this slight bend is to increase angle strain but to decrease torsional strain, until a minimum-energy balance
     between the two opposing effects is achieved.

not quite eclipsed.

Cyclopentane

Cyclopentane was predicted by Baeyer to be nearly strain-free, but it actually has a total strain energy of 26
kJ/mol (6.2 kcal/mol). Although planar cyclopentane has practically no angle strain, it has a large torsional
strain. Cyclopentane therefore twists to adopt a puckered, nonplanar conformation that strikes a balance
between increased angle strain and decreased torsional strain. Four of the cyclopentane carbon atoms are in
approximately the same plane, with the fifth carbon atom bent out of the plane. Most of the hydrogens are nearly
staggered with respect to their neighbors (FIGURE 4.7).

FIGURE 4.7 The conformation of cyclopentane. Carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4 are nearly coplanar, but carbon 5 is out of the plane. Part (c) is a
Newman projection along the C1-C2 bond, showing that neighboring C-H bonds are nearly staggered.

PROBLEM       How many H  H eclipsing interactions would be present if cyclopentane were planar? Assuming
        4-10  an energy cost of 4.0 kJ/mol for each eclipsing interaction, how much torsional strain would planar
              cyclopentane have? Since the measured total strain of cyclopentane is 26 kJ/mol, how much of the
              torsional strain is relieved by puckering?

PROBLEM Two conformations of cis-1,3-dimethylcyclobutane are shown. What is the difference between
        4-11 them, and which do you think is likely to be more stable?

4.5 Conformations of Cyclohexane

Substituted cyclohexanes are the most common cycloalkanes and occur widely in nature. A large number of
compounds, including steroids and many pharmaceutical agents, have cyclohexane rings. The flavoring agent
menthol, for instance, has three substituents on a six-membered ring.
114  4 · Organic Compounds: Cycloalkanes and Their Stereochemistry

     Cyclohexane adopts a strain-free, three-dimensional shape that is called a chair conformation because of its
     similarity to a lounge chair, with a back, seat, and footrest (FIGURE 4.8). Chair cyclohexane has neither angle
     strain nor torsional strain--all C-C-C bond angles are near the 109° tetrahedral value, and all neighboring C-H
     bonds are staggered.

     FIGURE 4.8 The strain-free chair conformation of cyclohexane. All C-C-C bond angles are 111.5°, close to the ideal 109° tetrahedral
     angle, and all neighboring C-H bonds are staggered.

     The easiest way to visualize chair cyclohexane is to build a molecular model if you have access to a model kit, or
     alternatively to explore with one of the many computer-based modeling programs you may have access to.

     The chair conformation of cyclohexane can be drawn in three steps.

     STEP 1
     Draw two parallel lines, slanted downward and slightly offset from each other. This means that four of the
     cyclohexane carbons lie in a plane.
     STEP 2
     Place the topmost carbon atom above and to the right of the plane of the other four, and connect the bonds.
     STEP 3
     Place the bottommost carbon atom below and to the left of the plane of the middle four, and connect the bonds.
     Note that the bonds to the bottommost carbon atom are parallel to the bonds to the topmost carbon.
     When viewing cyclohexane, it's helpful to remember that the lower bond is in front and the upper bond is in
     back. If this convention isn't defined, it can appear that the reverse is true. For clarity, all cyclohexane rings
     drawn in this book will have the front (lower) bond heavily shaded to indicate nearness to the viewer.

     In addition to the chair conformation of cyclohexane, there is an alternative conformation of cyclohexane that
     bears a slight resemblance to a twisted boat. Called the twist-boat conformation, it is nearly free of angle strain.
     It does, however, have both steric strain and torsional strain and is about 23 kJ/mol (5.5 kcal/mol) higher in

energy than the chair conformation. As a result, molecules adopt the twist-boat geometry only rarely.

4.6 Axial and Equatorial Bonds in Cyclohexane

The chair conformation of cyclohexane has many consequences. We'll see in Section 11.9, for instance, that
the chemical behavior of many substituted cyclohexanes is influenced by their conformation. In addition, we'll
see in Section 25.5 that simple carbohydrates, such as glucose, adopt a conformation based on the cyclohexane
chair and that their chemistry is directly affected as a result.

Another trait of the chair conformation is that there are two kinds of positions for substituents on the
cyclohexane ring: axial positions and equatorial positions (as shown in FIGURE 4.9). The six axial positions are
parallel to the ring axis, while the six equatorial positions are in the rough plane of the ring, around the ring
equator.

FIGURE 4.9 Axial and equatorial positions in chair cyclohexane. The six axial hydrogens are parallel to the ring axis, and the six equatorial
hydrogens are in a band around the ring equator.

As shown in FIGURE 4.9, each carbon atom in chair cyclohexane has one axial and one equatorial hydrogen.
Furthermore, each side of the ring has three axial and three equatorial hydrogens in an alternating
arrangement. For example, if the top side of the ring has axial hydrogens on carbons 1, 3, and 5, then it has
equatorial hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6. The reverse is true for the bottom side: carbons 1, 3, and 5 have
equatorial hydrogens, but carbons 2, 4, and 6 have axial hydrogens (FIGURE 4.10).
116  4 · Organic Compounds: Cycloalkanes and Their Stereochemistry

     FIGURE 4.10 Alternating axial and equatorial positions in chair cyclohexane, looking directly down the ring axis. Each carbon atom has
     one axial and one equatorial position, and each face has alternating axial and equatorial positions.

     Note that we haven't used the words cis and trans in this discussion of cyclohexane conformation. Two
     hydrogens on the same side of the ring are always cis, regardless of whether they're axial or equatorial and
     regardless of whether they're adjacent. Similarly, two hydrogens on opposite sides of the ring are always trans.

     Axial and equatorial bonds can be drawn following the procedure shown in FIGURE 4.11. If possible, look at a
     molecular model as you practice.

                                      FIGURE 4.11 A procedure for drawing axial and equatorial bonds in chair cyclohexane.

     Because chair cyclohexane has two kinds of positions--axial and equatorial--we might expect to find two
     isomeric forms of a monosubstituted cyclohexane. In fact, we don't. There is only one methylcyclohexane,
     one bromocyclohexane, one cyclohexanol (hydroxycyclohexane), and so on, because cyclohexane rings are
     conformationally mobile at room temperature. Different chair conformations readily interconvert, exchanging
     axial and equatorial positions. This interconversion, called a ring-flip, is shown in FIGURE 4.12.

4.6 · Axial and Equatorial Bonds in Cyclohexane                                                                                             117

FIGURE 4.12 A ring-flip in chair cyclohexane interconverts axial and equatorial positions. What is axial in the starting structure becomes
equatorial in the ring-flipped structure, and what is equatorial in the starting structure is axial after ring-flip.

As shown in FIGURE 4.12, a chair cyclohexane can be ring-flipped by keeping the middle four carbon atoms
in place while folding the two end carbons in opposite directions. In so doing, an axial substituent in one
chair form becomes an equatorial substituent in the ring-flipped chair form and vice versa. For example,
axial bromocyclohexane becomes equatorial bromocyclohexane after a ring-flip. Since the energy barrier to
chair-chair interconversion is only about 45 kJ/mol (10.8 kcal/mol), the process is rapid at room temperature
and we see what appears to be a single structure rather than distinct axial and equatorial isomers.

     4.7 Conformations of Monosubstituted Cyclohexanes

     Even though cyclohexane rings flip rapidly between chair conformations at room temperature, the two
     conformations of a monosubstituted cyclohexane aren't equally stable. In methylcyclohexane, for instance, the
     equatorial conformation is more stable than the axial conformation by 7.6 kJ/mol (1.8 kcal/mol). The same
     is true of other monosubstituted cyclohexanes: a substituent is almost always more stable in an equatorial
     position than in an axial position.

     You might recall from your general chemistry course that it's possible to calculate the percentages of two
     isomers at equilibrium using the equation E = -RT ln K, where E is the energy difference between isomers,
     R is the gas constant [8.315 J/(K·mol)], T is the Kelvin temperature, and K is the equilibrium constant between
     isomers. For example, an energy difference of 7.6 kJ/mol means that about 95% of methylcyclohexane
     molecules have an equatorial methyl group at any given instant while only 5% have an axial methyl group.
     FIGURE 4.13 plots the relationship between energy and isomer percentages.

     FIGURE 4.13 A plot of the percentages of two isomers at equilibrium versus the energy difference between them. The curves are
     calculated using the equation E = -RT ln K.

     The energy difference between axial and equatorial conformations is due to steric strain caused by 1,3-diaxial
     interactions. The axial methyl group on C1 is too close to the axial hydrogens three carbons away on C3 and C5,
     resulting in 7.6 kJ/mol of steric strain (FIGURE 4.14).

FIGURE 4.14 Interconversion of axial and equatorial methylcyclohexane, represented in several formats. The equatorial conformation
is more stable than the axial conformation by 7.6 kJ/mol.

The 1,3-diaxial steric strain in substituted methylcyclohexane is already familiar--we saw it previously as
the steric strain between methyl groups in gauche in Section 3.7. Gauche butane is less stable than anti
butane by 3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol) because of steric interference between hydrogen atoms on the two methyl
groups. Comparing a four-carbon fragment of axial methylcyclohexane with gauche butane shows that the
steric interaction is the same in both (FIGURE 4.15). Because axial methylcyclohexane has two such
interactions, it has 2 × 3.8 = 7.6 kJ/mol of steric strain. Equatorial methylcyclohexane has no such interactions
and is therefore more stable.

FIGURE 4.15 The origin of 1,3-diaxial interactions in methylcyclohexane. The steric strain between an axial methyl group and an
axial hydrogen atom three carbons away is identical to the steric strain in gauche butane. (To display clearly the diaxial interactions in
methylcyclohexane, two of the equatorial hydrogens are not shown.)

The exact amount of 1,3-diaxial steric strain in a given substituted cyclohexane depends on the nature and size
of the substituent, as indicated in TABLE 4.1. Not surprisingly, the amount of steric strain increases through the
series H3C- < CH3CH2- < (CH3)2CH-<< (CH3)3C-, paralleling the increasing size of the alkyl groups. Note that
the values given in TABLE 4.1 refer to 1,3-diaxial interactions of the substituent with a single hydrogen atom.
These values must be doubled to arrive at the amount of strain in a monosubstituted cyclohexane.

     4.8 Conformations of Disubstituted Cyclohexanes

     Monosubstituted cyclohexanes are always more stable with their substituent in an equatorial position, but the
     situation with disubstituted cyclohexanes is more complex because the steric effects of both substituents must
     be taken into account. All steric interactions for both possible chair conformations must be analyzed before
     deciding which conformation is favored.

     Let's look at 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane as an example. There are two isomers, cis-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane and
     trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, which must be considered separately. In the cis isomer, both methyl groups are
     on the same face of the ring and the compound can exist in either of the two chair conformations shown in
     FIGURE 4.16. (It may be easier for you to see whether a compound is cis- or trans-disubstituted by first drawing
     the ring as a flat representation and then converting it to a chair conformation.)

methyl group. The top conformation in FIGURE 4.16 has an axial methyl group at C2, which has 1,3-diaxial
interactions with hydrogens on C4 and C6. The ring-flipped conformation has an axial methyl group at C1,
which has 1,3-diaxial interactions with hydrogens on C3 and C5. In addition, both conformations have gauche
butane interactions between the two methyl groups. The two conformations are equal in energy, with a total
steric strain of 3 × 3.8 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ/mol (2.7 kcal/mol).
In trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, the two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring and the compound
can exist in either of the two chair conformations shown in FIGURE 4.17. The situation here is quite different
from that of the cis isomer. The top conformation in FIGURE 4.17 has both methyl groups equatorial with
only a gauche butane interaction between them (3.8 kJ/mol) but no 1,3-diaxial interactions. The ring-flipped
conformation, however, has both methyl groups axial. The axial methyl group at C1 interacts with axial
hydrogens at C3 and C5, and the axial methyl group at C2 interacts with axial hydrogens at C4 and C6. These
four 1,3-diaxial interactions produce a steric strain of 4 × 3.8 kJ/mol = 15.2 kJ/mol and make the diaxial
conformation 15.2 - 3.8 = 11.4 kJ/mol less favorable than the diequatorial conformation. We therefore predict
that trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane will exist almost exclusively in the diequatorial conformation.

FIGURE 4.17 Conformations of trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The conformation with both methyl groups equatorial (top) is favored by
11.4 kJ/mol (2.7 kcal/mol) over the conformation with both methyl groups axial (bottom).

The same kind of conformational analysis just carried out for cis- and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane can be
done for any substituted cyclohexane, such as cis-1-tert-butyl-4-chlorocyclohexane (see Worked Example 4.3).

     As you might imagine, though, the situation becomes more complex as the number of substituents increases.
     For instance, compare glucose with mannose, a carbohydrate present in seaweed. Which do you think is more
     strained? In glucose, all substituents on the six-membered ring are equatorial, while in mannose, one of the

on the right, the tert-butyl group is axial and the chlorine is equatorial. These conformations aren't of equal
energy because an axial tert-butyl substituent and an axial chloro substituent produce different amounts of
steric strain. TABLE 4.1 shows that the 1,3-diaxial interaction between a hydrogen and a tert-butyl group

mol (0.25 kcal/mol). An axial tert-butyl group therefore produces (2 × 11.4 kJ/mol) - (2 × 1.0 kJ/mol) = 20.8
kJ/mol (4.9 kcal/mol) more steric strain than an axial chlorine, and the compound preferentially adopts the
conformation with the chlorine axial and the tert-butyl equatorial.

4.9 Conformations of Polycyclic Molecules

The final point we'll consider about cycloalkane stereochemistry is to see what happens when two or more
cycloalkane rings are fused together along a common bond to construct a polycyclic molecule--for example,
decalin.

Decalin consists of two cyclohexane rings joined to share two carbon atoms (the bridgehead carbons, C1 and
C6) and a common bond. Decalin can exist in either of two isomeric forms, depending on whether the rings
are trans fused or cis fused. In cis-decalin, the hydrogen atoms at the bridgehead carbons are on the same
side of the rings; in trans-decalin, the bridgehead hydrogens are on opposite sides. FIGURE 4.18 shows how
both compounds can be represented using chair cyclohexane conformations. Note that the two decalin isomers
are not interconvertible by ring-flips or other rotations. They are cis-trans stereoisomers and have the same
relationship to each other that cis- and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane have.

     FIGURE 4.18 Representations of cis- and trans-decalin. Hydrogen atoms at the bridgehead carbons are on the same face of the rings in
     the cis isomer but on opposite faces in the trans isomer.

     Polycyclic compounds are common in nature, and many valuable substances have fused-ring structures. For
     example, steroids, such as testosterone, the primary sex hormone in males, have three six-membered rings
     and one five-membered ring fused together. Although steroids look complicated compared with cyclohexane or
     decalin, the same principles that apply to the conformational analysis of simple cyclohexane rings apply equally
     well (and often better) to steroids.

     Another common ring system is the norbornane, or bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, structure. Like decalin, norbornane
     is a bicycloalkane, so called because two rings would have to be broken open to generate an acyclic structure.
     Its systematic name, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, reflects the fact that the molecule has seven carbons, is bicyclic, and
     has three "bridges" of 2, 2, and 1 carbon atoms connecting the two bridgehead carbons.

     Norbornane has a conformationally locked boat cyclohexane ring (Section 4.5) in which carbons 1 and 4 are
     joined by an additional CH2 group. In drawing this structure, a break in the rear bond indicates that the vertical
     bond crosses in front of it. Making a molecular model is particularly helpful when trying to see the three-

Molecular Mechanics

All the structural models in this book are computer-drawn. To make sure they accurately represent bond angles,
bond lengths, torsional interactions, and steric interactions, the most stable geometry of each molecule has
been calculated on a desktop computer using a commercially available molecular mechanics program based on
work by Norman Allinger at the University of Georgia.
The idea behind molecular mechanics is to begin with a rough geometry for a molecule and then calculate a
total strain energy for that starting geometry, using mathematical equations that assign values to specific kinds
of molecular interactions. Bond angles that are too large or too small cause angle strain; bond lengths that are
too short or too long cause stretching or compressing strain; unfavorable eclipsing interactions around single
bonds cause torsional strain; and nonbonded atoms that approach each other too closely cause steric, or van
der Waals, strain.

FIGURE 4.19 Computer programs make it possible to accurately represent molecular geometry. (credit: "Molecular geometry" by Jane
Whitney/Flickr, CC BY 4.0)

After calculating a total strain energy for the starting geometry, the program automatically changes the
geometry slightly in an attempt to lower strain--perhaps by lengthening a bond that is too short or decreasing
an angle that is too large. Strain is recalculated for the new geometry, more changes are made, and more
calculations are done. After dozens or hundreds of iterations, the calculation ultimately converges on a
minimum energy that corresponds to the most favorable, least strained conformation of the molecule.
Similar calculations have proven to be particularly useful in pharmaceutical research, where a complementary
fit between a drug molecule and a receptor molecule in the body is often the key to designing new
pharmaceutical agents (FIGURE 4.20).

Summary

Cyclic molecules are so commonly encountered throughout organic and biological chemistry that it's important
to understand the consequences of their cyclic structures. Thus, we've taken a close look at cyclic structures in
this chapter.

Cycloalkanes are saturated cyclic hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n. In contrast to open-chain
alkanes, where nearly free rotation occurs around C-C bonds, rotation is greatly reduced in cycloalkanes.
Disubstituted cycloalkanes can therefore exist as cis-trans isomers. The cis isomer has both substituents
on the same side of the ring; the trans isomer has substituents on opposite sides. Cis-trans isomers are just
one kind of stereoisomer--compounds that have the same connections between atoms but different three-
dimensional arrangements.

Not all cycloalkanes are equally stable. Three kinds of strain contribute to the overall energy of a cycloalkane:
(1) angle strain is the resistance of a bond angle to compression or expansion from the normal 109° tetrahedral
value, (2) torsional strain is the energy cost of having neighboring C-H bonds eclipsed rather than staggered,
and (3) steric strain is the repulsive interaction that arises when two groups attempt to occupy the same space.

Cyclopropane (115 kJ/mol strain) and cyclobutane (110.4 kJ/mol strain) have both angle strain and torsional
strain. Cyclopentane is free of angle strain but has a substantial torsional strain due to its large number
of eclipsing interactions. Both cyclobutane and cyclopentane pucker slightly away from planarity to relieve
torsional strain.

Cyclohexane is strain-free because it adopts a puckered chair conformation, in which all bond angles are near
109° and all neighboring C-H bonds are staggered. Chair cyclohexane has two kinds of positions: axial and
equatorial. Axial positions are oriented up and down, parallel to the ring axis, while equatorial positions lie in
a belt around the equator of the ring. Each carbon atom has one axial and one equatorial position.

Chair cyclohexanes are conformationally mobile and can undergo a ring-flip, which interconverts axial and
equatorial positions. Substituents on the ring are more stable in the equatorial position because axial
substituents cause 1,3-diaxial interactions. The amount of 1,3-diaxial steric strain caused by an axial
substituent depends on its size.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to
understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material
covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.
Are you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a
surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a
handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties
is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the
image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.
136  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     Handedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence
     of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules
     in our bodies--amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more--have a handedness. Furthermore,
     molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved
     in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.

     5.1 Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon

     What causes molecular handedness? Look at generalized molecules of the type CH3X, CH2XY, and CHXYZ
     shown in FIGURE 5.2. On the left are three molecules, and on the right are their images reflected in a mirror.
     The CH3X and CH2XY molecules are identical to their mirror images and thus are not handed. If you make
     a molecular model of each molecule and its mirror image, you find that you can superimpose one on the
     other so that all atoms coincide. The CHXYZ molecule, by contrast, is not identical to its mirror image. You
     can't superimpose a model of this molecule on a model of its mirror image for the same reason that you can't
     superimpose a left hand on a right hand: they simply aren't the same.

     FIGURE 5.2 Tetrahedral carbon atoms and their mirror images. Molecules of the type CH3X and CH2XY are identical to their mirror images,
     but a molecule of the type CHXYZ is not. A CHXYZ molecule is related to its mirror image in the same way a right hand is related to a left
     hand.

     A molecule that is not identical to its mirror image is a kind of stereoisomer (Section 4.2) called an enantiomer
     (e-nan-tee-oh-mer, from the Greek enantio, meaning "opposite"). Enantiomers are related to each other as
     a right hand is related to a left hand and result whenever a tetrahedral carbon is bonded to four different
     substituents (one need not be H). For example, lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) exists as a pair of
     enantiomers because there are four different groups (-H, -OH, -CH3, -CO2H) bonded to the central carbon
     atom. The enantiomers are called (+)-lactic acid and (-)-lactic acid. Both are found in sour milk, but only the (+)
     enantiomer occurs in muscle tissue.

No matter how hard you try, you can't superimpose a molecule of (+)-lactic acid on a molecule of (-)-lactic acid.
If any two groups match up, say -H and -CO2H, the remaining two groups don't match (FIGURE 5.3).

FIGURE 5.3 Attempts at superimposing the mirror-image forms of lactic acid. (a) When the -H and -OH substituents match up, the
-CO2H and -CH3 substituents don't; (b) when -CO2H and -CH3 match up, -H and -OH don't. Regardless of how the molecules are oriented,
they aren't identical.

5.2 The Reason for Handedness in Molecules: Chirality

A molecule that is not identical to its mirror image is said to be chiral (ky-ral, from the Greek cheir, meaning
"hand"). You can't take a chiral molecule and its enantiomer and place one on the other so that all atoms
coincide.
How can you predict whether a given molecule is or is not chiral? A molecule is not chiral if it has a plane of
symmetry. A plane of symmetry is a plane that cuts through the middle of a molecule (or any object) in such a
way that one half of the molecule or object is a mirror image of the other half. A coffee mug, for example, has
a plane of symmetry. If you were to cut the coffee mug in half from top to bottom, one half would be a mirror
image of the other half. A hand, however, does not have a plane of symmetry. One "half" of a hand is not a mirror
image of the other half (FIGURE 5.4).

FIGURE 5.4 The meaning of symmetry plane. (a) An object like the coffee mug has a symmetry plane cutting through it so that right and
left halves are mirror images. (b) An object like a hand has no symmetry plane; the right "half" of a hand is not a mirror image of the left half.

A molecule that has a plane of symmetry in any conformation must be identical to its mirror image and must be
nonchiral, or achiral. Thus, propanoic acid, CH3CH2CO2H, has a plane of symmetry when lined up as shown in
FIGURE 5.5 and is achiral, while lactic acid, CH3CH(OH)CO2H, has no plane of symmetry in any conformation
138  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     and is chiral.

     FIGURE 5.5 The achiral propanoic acid molecule versus the chiral lactic acid molecule. Propanoic acid has a plane of symmetry that
     makes one side of the molecule a mirror image of the other. Lactic acid has no such symmetry plane.

     The most common, although not the only, cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral
     carbon atom bonded to four different groups--for example, the central carbon atom in lactic acid. Such carbons
     are referred to as chirality centers, although other terms such as stereocenter, asymmetric center, and
     stereogenic center have also been used. Note that chirality is a property of the entire molecule, whereas a
     chirality center is the cause of chirality.
     Detecting a chirality center in a complex molecule takes practice because it's not always immediately apparent
     whether four different groups are bonded to a given carbon. The differences don't necessarily appear right
     next to the chirality center. For example, 5-bromodecane is a chiral molecule because four different groups
     are bonded to C5, the chirality center (marked with an asterisk). A butyl substituent is similar to a pentyl
     substituent, but it isn't identical. The difference isn't apparent until looking four carbon atoms away from the
     chirality center, but there's still a difference.

     As other possible examples, look at methylcyclohexane and 2-methylcyclohexanone. Methylcyclohexane is
     achiral because no carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups. You can immediately
     eliminate all -CH2- carbons and the -CH3 carbon from consideration, but what about C1 on the ring? The C1
     carbon atom is bonded to a -CH3 group, to an -H atom, and to C2 and C6 of the ring. Carbons 2 and 6 are
     equivalent, however, as are carbons 3 and 5. Thus, the C6-C5-C4 "substituent" is equivalent to the C2-C3-C4
     substituent, and methylcyclohexane is achiral. Another way of reaching the same conclusion is to realize that
     methylcyclohexane has a symmetry plane, which passes through the methyl group and through C1 and C4 of
     the ring.
     The situation is different for 2-methylcyclohexanone. 2-Methylcyclohexanone has no symmetry plane and is
     chiral because its C2 is bonded to four different groups: a -CH3 group, an -H atom, a -COCH2- ring bond (C1),
     and a -CH2CH2- ring bond (C3).

     5.3 Optical Activity

     The study of chirality originated in the early 19th century during investigations by the French physicist Jean-
     Baptiste Biot into the nature of plane-polarized light. A beam of ordinary light consists of electromagnetic waves
     that oscillate in an infinite number of planes at right angles to its direction of travel. When a beam of ordinary
     light passes through a device called a polarizer, however, only the light waves oscillating in a single plane pass
     through and the light is said to be plane-polarized. Light waves in all other planes are blocked out.

     Biot made the remarkable observation that when a beam of plane-polarized light passes through a solution of
     certain organic molecules, such as sugar or camphor, the plane of polarization is rotated through an angle, .
     Not all organic substances exhibit this property, but those that do are said to be optically active.

     The angle of rotation can be measured with an instrument called a polarimeter, represented in FIGURE 5.6. A
     solution of optically active organic molecules is placed in a sample tube, plane-polarized light is passed through
     the tube, and rotation of the polarization plane occurs. The light then goes through a second polarizer called the
     analyzer. By rotating the analyzer until the light passes through it, we can find the new plane of polarization and
     can tell to what extent rotation has occurred.

FIGURE 5.6 Schematic representation of a polarimeter. Plane-polarized light passes through a solution of optically active molecules, which
rotate the plane of polarization.

In addition to determining the extent of rotation, we can also find the direction. From the vantage point of
the observer looking directly at the analyzer, some optically active molecules rotate polarized light to the left
(counterclockwise) and are said to be levorotatory, whereas others rotate polarized light to the right (clockwise)
and are said to be dextrorotatory. By convention, rotation to the left is given a minus sign (-) and rotation to the
right is given a plus sign (+). (-)-Morphine, for example, is levorotatory, and (+)-sucrose is dextrorotatory.

The extent of rotation observed in a polarimetry experiment depends on the number of optically active
molecules encountered by the light beam. This number, in turn, depends on sample concentration and sample
pathlength. If the concentration of the sample is doubled, the observed rotation doubles. If the concentration is
kept constant but the length of the sample tube is doubled, the observed rotation doubles. It also happens that
the angle of rotation depends on the wavelength of the light used.

To express optical rotations in a meaningful way so that comparisons can be made, we have to choose standard
conditions. The specific rotation, []D, of a compound is defined as the observed rotation when light of 589.6
nanometer (nm; 1 nm = 10-9 m) wavelength is used with a sample pathlength l of 1 decimeter (dm; 1 dm = 10
cm) and a sample concentration c of 1 g/cm3. (Light of 589.6 nm, the so-called sodium D line, is the yellow light
emitted from common sodium street lamps.)

When optical rotations are expressed in this standard way, the specific rotation, []D, is a physical constant
characteristic of a given optically active compound. For example, (+)-lactic acid has []D = +3.82, and (-)-lactic
acid has []D = -3.82. That is, the two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light to exactly the same extent but
in opposite directions. Note that the units of specific rotation are [(deg · cm2)/g] but the values are usually

expressed without units. Some additional examples are listed in TABLE 5.1.

     5.4 Pasteur's Discovery of Enantiomers

     Little was done to build on Biot's discovery of optical activity until 1848, when Louis Pasteur began work on
     a study of crystalline tartaric acid salts derived from wine. On crystallizing a concentrated solution of sodium
     ammonium tartrate below 28 °C, Pasteur made the surprising observation that two distinct kinds of crystals
     were obtained. Furthermore, the two kinds of crystals were nonsuperimposable mirror images and were related
     in the same way that a right hand is related to a left hand.

     Working carefully with tweezers, Pasteur was able to separate the crystals into two piles, one of "right-handed"
     crystals and one of "left-handed" crystals, like those shown in FIGURE 5.7. Although the original sample, a 50
     : 50 mixture of right and left, was optically inactive, solutions of the crystals from each of the sorted piles were
     optically active and their specific rotations were equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

in solution, and the other is levorotatory.

Pasteur was far ahead of his time. Although the structural theory of Kekulé had not yet been proposed, Pasteur
explained his results by speaking of the molecules themselves, saying, "There is no doubt that [in the dextro
tartaric acid] there exists an asymmetric arrangement having a nonsuperimposable image. It is no less certain
that the atoms of the levo acid have precisely the inverse asymmetric arrangement." Pasteur's vision was
extraordinary, for it was not until 25 years later that his ideas regarding asymmetric carbon atoms were
confirmed.

Today, we would describe Pasteur's work by saying that he had discovered enantiomers. Enantiomers, also
called optical isomers, have identical physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, but differ in
the direction in which their solutions rotate plane-polarized light.

5.5 Sequence Rules for Specifying Configuration

Structural drawings provide a visual representation of stereochemistry, but a written method for indicating
the three-dimensional arrangement, or configuration, of substituents at a chirality center is also needed. The
method used a set of sequence rules to rank the four groups attached to the chirality center and then looks at
the handedness with which those groups are attached. Called the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules after the chemists
who proposed them, the sequence rules are as follows:

RULE 1
Look at the four atoms directly attached to the chirality center, and rank them according to atomic number.
The atom with the highest atomic number has the highest ranking (first), and the atom with the lowest atomic
number (usually hydrogen) has the lowest ranking (fourth). When different isotopes of the same element are
compared, such as deuterium (2H) and protium (1H), the heavier isotope ranks higher than the lighter isotope.
Thus, atoms commonly found in organic compounds have the following order.

RULE 2
If a decision can't be reached by ranking the first atoms in the substituent, look at the second, third, or
fourth atoms away from the chirality center until the first difference is found. A -CH2CH3 substituent and
a -CH3 substituent are equivalent by rule 1 because both have carbon as the first atom. By rule 2, however,
ethyl ranks higher than methyl because ethyl has a carbon as its highest second atom, while methyl has only
hydrogen as its second atom. Look at the following pairs of examples to see how the rule works:

RULE 3

Multiple-bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of single-bonded atoms. For example, an

aldehyde substituent (  ), which has a carbon atom doubly bonded to one oxygen, is equivalent to a

substituent having a carbon atom singly bonded to two oxygens:
144  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     As further examples, the following pairs are equivalent:

     Having ranked the four groups attached to a chiral carbon, we describe the stereochemical configuration
     around the carbon by orienting the molecule so that the group with the lowest ranking (4) points directly away
     from us. We then look at the three remaining substituents, which now appear to radiate toward us like the
     spokes on a steering wheel (FIGURE 5.8). If a curved arrow drawn from the highest to second-highest to third-
     highest ranked substituent (1  2  3) is clockwise, we say that the chirality center has the R configuration (S
     for the Latin rectus, meaning "right"). If an arrow from 1  2  3 is counterclockwise, the chirality center has
     the S configuration (Latin sinister, meaning "left"). To remember these assignments, think of a car's steering
     wheel when making a Right (clockwise) turn.

     FIGURE 5.8 Assigning R and S configurations to chirality centers. When the molecule is oriented so that the lowest-ranked group (4) is
     toward the rear, the remaining three groups radiate toward the viewer like the spokes of a steering wheel. If the direction of travel 1  2  3
     is clockwise (right turn), the center has the R configuration. If the direction of travel 1  2  3 is counterclockwise (left turn), the center is S.

     Look at (-)-lactic acid in FIGURE 5.9 for an example of how to assign configuration. Sequence rule 1 says that
     -OH is ranked 1 and -H is ranked 4, but it doesn't allow us to distinguish between -CH3 and -CO2H because
     both groups have carbon as their first atom. Sequence rule 2, however, says that -CO2H ranks higher than -CH3
     because O (the highest second atom in -CO2H) outranks H (the highest second atom in -CH3). Now, turn the

molecule so that the fourth-ranked group (-H) is oriented toward the rear, away from the observer. Since a

curved arrow from 1 (-OH) to 2 (-CO2H) to 3 (-CH3) is clockwise (right turn of the steering wheel), (-)-lactic acid
has the R configuration. Applying the same procedure to (+)-lactic acid leads to the opposite assignment.

Further examples are provided by naturally occurring (-)-glyceraldehyde and (+)-alanine, which both have the
S configuration as shown in FIGURE 5.10. Note that the sign of optical rotation, (+) or (-), is not related to the R,S
designation. (S)-Glyceraldehyde happens to be levorotatory (-), and (S)-alanine happens to be dextrorotatory
(+). There is no simple correlation between R,S configuration and direction or magnitude of optical rotation.

FIGURE 5.10 Assigning configuration to (a) (-)-glyceraldehyde. (b) (+)-alanine. Both happen to have the S configuration, although one
is levorotatory and the other is dextrorotatory.

One additional point needs to be mentioned--the matter of absolute configuration. How do we know that the
assignments of R and S configuration are correct in an absolute sense, rather than a relative, sense? Since
146  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     there is no correlation between the R,S configuration and the direction or magnitude of optical rotation, how do
     we know that the R configuration belongs to the levorotatory enantiomer of lactic acid? This difficult question
     was finally solved in 1951, when an X-ray diffraction method was found for determining the absolute spatial
     arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Based on those results, we can say with certainty that the R,S conventions
     are correct.

     Assigning Configuration to Chirality Centers

     Orient each of the following drawings so that the lowest-ranked group is toward the rear, and then assign R or S

     Strategy
     It takes practice to be able to visualize and orient a chirality center in three dimensions. You might start by
     indicating where the observer must be located--180° opposite the lowest-ranked group. Then imagine yourself
     in the position of the observer, and redraw what you would see.

     Solution
     In (a), you would be located in front of the page toward the top right of the molecule, and you would see group 2
     to your left, group 3 to your right, and group 1 below you. This corresponds to an R configuration.

     In (b), you would be located behind the page toward the top left of the molecule from your point of view, and
     you would see group 3 to your left, group 1 to your right, and group 2 below you. This also corresponds to an R

5.6 Diastereomers

Molecules like lactic acid, alanine, and glyceraldehyde are relatively simple because each has only one chirality
center and thus only two stereoisomers. The situation becomes more complex, however, with molecules that
have more than one chirality center. As a general rule, a molecule with n chirality centers can have up to
148  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     2n stereoisomers (although it may have fewer, as we'll see below). Take the amino acid threonine
     (2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid), for example. Since threonine has two chirality centers (C2 and C3), there
     are four possible stereoisomers, as shown in FIGURE 5.11. Check for yourself that the R,S configurations of all
     stereoisomers are correct.

                                               FIGURE 5.11 The four stereoisomers of 2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid.

     The four stereoisomers of 2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid can be grouped into two pairs of enantiomers. The
     2R,3R stereoisomer is the mirror image of 2S,3S, and the 2R,3S stereoisomer is the mirror image of 2S,3R.
     But what is the relationship between any two molecules that are not mirror images? What, for instance, is
     the relationship between the 2R,3R isomer and the 2R,3S isomer? They are stereoisomers, yet they aren't
     enantiomers. To describe such a relationship, we need a new term--diastereomer.

     Diastereomers (dia-stair-e-oh-mers) are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. Since we used the right-
     hand/left-hand analogy to describe the relationship between two enantiomers, we might extend the analogy by
     saying that the relationship between diastereomers is like that of hands from different people. Your hand and
     your friend's hand look similar, but they aren't identical and they aren't mirror images. The same is true of
     diastereomers: they're similar, but they aren't identical and they aren't mirror images.

     Note carefully the difference between enantiomers and diastereomers: enantiomers have opposite
     configurations at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have opposite configurations at some (one or
     more) chirality centers but the same configuration at others. A full description of the four stereoisomers of
     threonine is given in TABLE 5.2. Of the four, only the 2S,3R isomer, []D = -28.3, occurs naturally in plants and
     animals and is an essential nutrient for humans. This result is typical: most biological molecules are chiral, and
     usually only one stereoisomer is found in nature.

In the special case where two diastereomers differ at only one chirality center but are the same at all others,
we say that the compounds are epimers. Cholestanol and coprostanol, for instance, are both found in human
feces, and both have nine chirality centers. Eight of the nine are identical, but the one at C5 is different. Thus,
cholestanol and coprostanol are epimeric at C5.

     5.7 Meso Compounds

     Let's look at another example (Section 5.4) of a compound with more than one chirality center: the tartaric acid
     used by Pasteur. The four stereoisomers can be drawn as follows:

     The 2R,3R and 2S,3S structures are nonsuperimposable mirror images and therefore represent a pair of
     enantiomers. A close look at the 2R,3S and 2S,3R structures, however, shows that they are superimposable, and
     thus identical, as can be seen by rotating one structure 180°.

     The 2R,3S and 2S,3R structures are identical because the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore
     achiral. The symmetry plane cuts through the C2-C3 bond, making one half of the molecule a mirror image of
     the other half (FIGURE 5.12). Because of the plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral, despite the fact that
     it has two chirality centers. Such compounds, which are achiral, yet contain chirality centers, are called meso
     compounds (me-zo). Thus, tartaric acid exists in three stereoisomeric forms: two enantiomers and one meso
     form.

Distinguishing Chiral Compounds from Meso Compounds

Does cis-1,2-dimethylcyclobutane have any chirality centers? Is it chiral?

Strategy
To see whether a chirality center is present, look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. To see
whether the molecule is chiral, look for the presence or absence of a symmetry plane. Not all molecules with
chirality centers are chiral overall--meso compounds are an exception.

Solution
A look at the structure of cis-1,2-dimethylcyclobutane shows that both methyl-bearing ring carbons (C1 and C2)
are chirality centers. Overall, though, the compound is achiral because there is a symmetry plane bisecting the
ring between C1 and C2. Thus, the molecule is a meso compound.

     5.8 Racemic Mixtures and the Resolution of Enantiomers

     To end this discussion of stereoisomerism, let's return for a last look at Pasteur's pioneering work, described in
     Section 5.4. Pasteur took an optically inactive tartaric acid salt and found that he could crystallize from it two
     optically active forms having what we would now call 2R,3R and 2S,3S configurations. But what was the optically
     inactive form he started with? It couldn't have been meso-tartaric acid, because meso-tartaric acid is a different
     chemical compound and can't interconvert with the two chiral enantiomers without breaking and re-forming
     chemical bonds.

     The answer is that Pasteur started with a 50 : 50 mixture of the two chiral tartaric acid enantiomers. Such
     a mixture is called a racemate (rass-uh-mate), or racemic mixture, and is denoted by either the symbol
     (±) or the prefix d,l to indicate an equal mixture of dextrorotatory and levorotatory forms. Racemates show
     no optical rotation because the (+) rotation from one enantiomer exactly cancels the (-) rotation from the
     other. Through good luck, Pasteur was able to separate, or resolve, racemic tartaric acid into its (+) and (-)
     enantiomers. Unfortunately, the fractional crystallization technique he used doesn't work for most racemates,
     so other methods are needed.

     The most common method for resolving the racemate of a chiral carboxylic acid (RCO2H) is to carry out an acid-
     base reaction between the acid and an amine base (RNH2) to yield an ammonium salt:

     To understand how this method of resolution works, let's see what happens when a racemic mixture of chiral
     acids, such as (+)- and (-)-lactic acids, reacts with an achiral amine base, such as methylamine, CH3NH2. The
     situation is analogous to what happens when left and right hands (chiral) pick up a ball (achiral). Both left and
     right hands pick up the ball equally well, and the products--ball in right hand versus ball in left hand--are mirror
     images. In the same way, both (+)- and (-)-lactic acid react with methylamine equally well, and the product
     is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers methylammonium (+)-lactate and methylammonium (-)-lactate
     (FIGURE 5.13).

             FIGURE 5.13 Reaction of racemic lactic acid with achiral methylamine gives a racemic mixture of ammonium salts.

Now let's see what happens when the racemic mixture of (+)- and (-)-lactic acids reacts with a single enantiomer
of a chiral amine base, such as (R)-1-phenylethylamine. The situation is analogous to what happens when left
and right hands (chiral) put on a right-handed glove (also chiral). Left and right hands don't put on the right-
handed glove in the same way, so the products--right hand in right glove versus left hand in right glove--are not
mirror images; they're similar but different.
In the same way, (+)- and (-)-lactic acids react with (R)-1-phenylethylamine to give two different products
(FIGURE 5.14). (R)-Lactic acid reacts with (R)-1-phenylethylamine to give the R,R salt, and (S)-lactic acid reacts
with the R amine to give the S,R salt. The two salts are diastereomers, not enantiomers. They have different
chemical and physical properties, and it may therefore be possible to separate them by crystallization or some
other means. Once separated, acidification of the two diastereomeric salts with a strong acid makes it possible
to isolate the two pure enantiomers of lactic acid and to recover the chiral amine for reuse.

FIGURE 5.14 Reaction of racemic lactic acid with (R)-1-phenylethylamine yields a mixture of diastereomeric ammonium salts, which
have different properties and can be separated.

     5.9 A Review of Isomerism

     As noted on several previous occasions, isomers are compounds with the same chemical formula but different
     structures. We've seen several kinds of isomers in the past few chapters, and it's a good idea at this point to see
     how they relate to one another (FIGURE 5.15).

                                                          FIGURE 5.15 A summary of the different kinds of isomers.

     There are two fundamental types of isomers, both of which we've now encountered: constitutional isomers and
     stereoisomers.
     Constitutional isomers (Section 3.2) are compounds whose atoms are connected differently. Among the kinds
     of constitutional isomers we've seen are skeletal, functional, and positional isomers.

Stereoisomers (Section 4.2) are compounds whose atoms are connected in the same order but with a different
spatial arrangement. Among the kinds of stereoisomers we've seen are enantiomers, diastereomers, and
cis-trans isomers of cycloalkanes. Actually, cis-trans isomers are just a subclass of diastereomers because they
are non-mirror-image stereoisomers:

5.10 Chirality at Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur

As noted previously, the most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of four different
substituents bonded to a tetrahedral atom. Although that atom is usually carbon, it doesn't necessarily have
to be. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms are all commonly encountered in organic molecules, and can
all be chirality centers. We know, for instance, that trivalent nitrogen is tetrahedral, with its lone pair of
electrons acting as the fourth "substituent" (Section 1.10). Is trivalent nitrogen chiral? Does a compound such
as ethylmethylamine exist as a pair of enantiomers?

The answer is both yes and no. Yes in principle, but no in practice. It turns out that most trivalent nitrogen
compounds undergo a rapid umbrella-like inversion that interconverts enantiomers, so we can't isolate
individual enantiomers except in special cases.
156  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     A similar situation occurs in trivalent phosphorus compounds, called phosphines, but the inversion at
     phosphorus is substantially slower than inversion at nitrogen, so stable chiral phosphines can be isolated. (R)-
     and (S)-methylpropylphenylphosphine, for instance, are configurationally stable for several hours at 100 °C.
     We'll see the importance of phosphine chirality in Section 26.7 in connection with the synthesis of chiral amino
     acids.

     Divalent sulfur compounds are achiral, but trivalent sulfur compounds called sulfonium salts (R3S+) can be
     chiral. Like phosphines, sulfonium salts undergo relatively slow inversion, so chiral sulfonium salts are
     configurationally stable and can be isolated. Perhaps the best known example is the coenzyme
     S-adenosylmethionine, the so-called biological methyl donor, which is involved in many metabolic pathways
     as a source of CH3 groups. (The "S" in the name S-adenosylmethionine stands for sulfur and means that
     the adenosyl group is attached to the sulfur atom of the amino acid methionine.) The molecule has S
     stereochemistry at sulfur and is configurationally stable for several days at room temperature. Its R enantiomer
     is also known but is not biologically active.

     5.11 Prochirality

     Closely related to the concept of chirality, and particularly important in biological chemistry, is the notion of
     prochirality. A molecule is said to be prochiral if it can be converted from achiral to chiral in a single chemical
     step. For instance, an unsymmetrical ketone like 2-butanone is prochiral because it can be converted to the
     chiral alcohol 2-butanol by the addition of hydrogen, as we'll see in Section 17.4.

     Which enantiomer of 2-butanol is produced depends on which face of the planar carbonyl group undergoes
     reaction. To distinguish between the possibilities, we use the stereochemical descriptors Re and Si. Rank the

5.11 · Prochirality                                                                                                  157

three groups attached to the trigonal, sp2-hybridized carbon, and imagine curved arrows from the highest
to second-highest to third-highest ranked substituents. The face on which the arrows curve clockwise is
designated the Re face (similar to R), and the face on which the arrows curve counterclockwise is designated
the Si face (similar to S). In this example, addition of hydrogen from the Re face gives (S)-2-butane, and addition
from the Si face gives (R)-2-butane.

In addition to compounds with planar, sp2-hybridized atoms, compounds with tetrahedral, sp3-hybridized
atoms can also be prochiral. An sp3-hybridized atom is said to be a prochirality center if, by changing one
of its attached groups, it becomes a chirality center. The -CH2OH carbon atom of ethanol, for instance, is a
prochirality center because changing one of its attached -H atoms converts it into a chirality center.

To distinguish between the two identical atoms (or groups of atoms) on a prochirality center, we imagine a
change that will raise the ranking of one atom over the other without affecting its rank with respect to other
attached groups. On the -CH2OH carbon of ethanol, for instance, we might imagine replacing one of the 1H
atoms (protium) by 2H (deuterium). The newly introduced 2H atom ranks higher than the remaining 1H atom,
but it remains lower than other groups attached to the carbon. Of the two identical atoms in the original
compound, the atom whose replacement leads to an R chirality center is said to be pro-R and the atom whose
replacement leads to an S chirality center is pro-S.

A large number of biological reactions involve prochiral compounds. One of the steps in the citric acid cycle
by which food is metabolized, for instance, is the addition of H2O to fumarate to give malate. Addition of -OH
occurs on the Si face of a fumarate carbon and gives (S)-malate as product.

As another example, studies with deuterium-labeled substrates have shown that the reaction of ethanol with the
coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), catalyzed by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, occurs with
exclusive removal of the pro-R hydrogen from ethanol and with addition only to the Re face of NAD+.
158  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     Determining the stereochemistry of reactions at prochirality centers is a powerful method for studying detailed
     mechanisms in biochemical reactions. As just one example, the conversion of citrate to cis-aconitate in the
     citric acid cycle has been shown to occur with loss of a pro-R hydrogen, implying that the OH and H groups leave
     from opposite sides of the molecule.

5.12 Chirality in Nature and Chiral Environments

Although the different enantiomers of a chiral molecule have the same physical properties, they usually have
different biological properties. For example, a change in chirality can affect the biological properties of many
drugs, such as fluoxetine, a heavily prescribed medication sold under the trade name Prozac. Racemic
fluoxetine is an effective antidepressant but has no activity against migraine. The pure S enantiomer, however,
works remarkably well in preventing migraine. Other examples of how chirality affects biological properties are
given in the Chapter 5 Chemistry Matters at the end of this chapter.

Why do different enantiomers have different biological properties? To have a biological effect, a substance
typically must fit into an appropriate receptor that has a complementary shape. But because biological
receptors are chiral, only one enantiomer of a chiral substrate can fit, just as only a right hand can fit into a
right-handed glove. The mirror-image enantiomer will be a misfit, like a left hand in a right-handed glove. A
representation of the interaction between a chiral molecule and a chiral biological receptor is shown in FIGURE
5.16: one enantiomer fits the receptor perfectly, but the other does not.

FIGURE 5.16 Interaction of a chiral object with a chiral receptor. A left hand interacts with a chiral object, much as a biological receptor
interacts with a chiral molecule. (a) One enantiomer fits into the hand perfectly: green thumb, red palm, and gray pinkie finger, with the
blue substituent exposed. (b) The other enantiomer, however, can't fit into the hand. When the green thumb and gray pinkie finger interact
appropriately, the palm holds a blue substituent rather than a red one, with the red substituent exposed.

The hand-in-glove fit of a chiral substrate into a chiral receptor is relatively straightforward, but it's less obvious
how a prochiral substrate can undergo a selective reaction. Take the reaction of ethanol with NAD+ catalyzed by
yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. As we saw at the end of Section 5.11, this reaction occurs with exclusive removal
of the pro-R hydrogen from ethanol and with addition only to the Re face of the NAD+ carbon.

We can understand this result by imagining that the chiral enzyme receptor again has three binding sites, as in
160  5 · Stereochemistry at Tetrahedral Centers

     FIGURE 5.16. When green and gray substituents of a prochiral substrate are held appropriately, however, only
     one of the two red substituents--say, the pro-S one--is also held while the other, pro-R, substituent is exposed
     for reaction.

     We describe the situation by saying that the receptor provides a chiral environment for the substrate. In the
     absence of a chiral environment, the two red substituents are chemically identical, but in the presence of a
     chiral environment, they are chemically distinctive (FIGURE 5.17a). The situation is similar to what happens
     when you pick up a coffee mug. By itself, the mug has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. When you pick up the
     mug, however, your hand provides a chiral environment so that one side becomes much more accessible and
     easier to drink from than the other (FIGURE 5.17b).

     FIGURE 5.17 (a) When a prochiral molecule is held in a chiral environment, the two seemingly identical substituents are
     distinguishable. (b) Similarly, when an achiral coffee mug is held in the chiral environment of your hand, it's much easier to drink from one
     side than the other because the two sides of the mug are now distinguishable.

     CHEMISTRY MATTERS

Chiral Drugs

The many hundreds of different pharmaceutical agents approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration come from many sources. Many drugs are isolated directly from plants or bacteria, and others
are made by chemical modification of naturally occurring compounds. An estimated 33%, however, are made
entirely in the laboratory and have no relatives in nature.

FIGURE 5.18 The S enantiomer of ibuprofen soothes the aches and pains of athletic injuries much more effectively than the R enantiomer.
(credit: "World Athletic Championships 2007 in Osaka" by Eckhard Pecher/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.5)

Those drugs that come from natural sources, either directly or after laboratory modification, are usually chiral
and are generally found only as a single enantiomer rather than as a racemate. Penicillin V, for example, an
antibiotic isolated from the Penicillium mold, has the 2S,5R,6R configuration. Its enantiomer, which does not
occur naturally but can be made in the laboratory, has no antibiotic activity.

In contrast to drugs from natural sources, drugs that are made entirely in the laboratory are either achiral or,
if chiral, are often produced and sold as racemates. Ibuprofen, for example, has one chirality center and is sold
commercially under such trade names as Advil, Nuprin, and Motrin as a 50 : 50 mixture of R and S. It turns out,
however, that only the S enantiomer is active as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. The R enantiomer of
ibuprofen is inactive, although it is slowly converted in the body to the active S form.
162 5 · Key Terms

Not only is it chemically wasteful to synthesize and administer an enantiomer that does not serve the intended
purpose, many instances are now known where the presence of the "wrong" enantiomer in a racemic mixture
either affects the body's ability to utilize the "right" enantiomer or has unintended pharmacological effects
of its own. The presence of (R)-ibuprofen in the racemic mixture, for instance, slows the rate at which the S
enantiomer takes effect in the body, from 12 minutes to 38 minutes.

To get around this problem, pharmaceutical companies attempt to devise methods of enantioselective
synthesis, which allow them to prepare only a single enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Viable methods
have been developed for the preparation of (S)-ibuprofen, which is marketed in Europe. We'll look further into
enantioselective synthesis in the Chapter 19 Chemistry Matters.

Summary

In this chapter, we've looked at some of the causes and consequences of molecular handedness--a topic of
particular importance in understanding biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex but is so
important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.

An object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning "handed."
A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a
mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence
of a tetrahedral, sp3-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups--a so-called chirality center.
Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers.
Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized
light.

The stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either R (rectus) or S (sinister) by
using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then
orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the
direction of decreasing rank (1  2  3) for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the
R configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the S configuration.

Some molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality
centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations
at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound
with n chirality centers can have a maximum of 2n stereoisomers.

A meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry.
Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50 : 50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual
diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.

A molecule is prochiral if it can be converted from achiral to chiral in a single chemical step. A prochiral
sp2-hybridized atom has two faces, described as either Re or Si. An sp3-hybridized atom is a prochirality
center if, by changing one of its attached atoms, a chirality center results. The atom whose replacement leads
to an R chirality center is pro-R, and the atom whose replacement leads to an S chirality center is pro-S.

follow the same "rules." Reactions in living organisms often look more complex than laboratory reactions
because of the size of the biomolecules and the involvement of biological catalysts called enzymes, but the
principles governing all chemical reactions are the same.
To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why
and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we'll start with an overview of the fundamental kinds
of organic reactions, we'll see why reactions occur, and we'll see how reactions can be described. Once this
172  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     background is out of the way, we'll then be ready to begin studying the details of organic chemistry in future
     chapters.

     When first approached, organic chemistry might seem overwhelming. It's not so much that any one part is
     difficult to understand, it's that there are so many parts: tens of millions of compounds, dozens of functional
     groups, and an apparently endless number of reactions. With study, though, it becomes evident that there are
     only a few fundamental ideas that underlie all organic reactions. Far from being a collection of isolated facts,
     organic chemistry is a beautifully logical subject that is unified by a few broad themes. When these themes are
     understood, learning organic chemistry becomes much easier and memorization is minimized. The aim of this
     book is to describe the themes and clarify the patterns that unify organic chemistry in future chapters.

     6.1 Kinds of Organic Reactions

     Organic chemical reactions can be organized broadly in two ways--by what kinds of reactions occur and by how
     those reactions occur. Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of
     organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.

       · Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms "left
           over." An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield
           an alkyl bromide.

     · Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant
        splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr. An example is
        the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.

     · Substitution reactions occur when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products. An example is
        the reaction of an ester such as methyl acetate with water to yield a carboxylic acid plus an alcohol. Similar
        reactions occur in many biological pathways, including the metabolism of dietary fats.

     · Rearrangement reactions occur when a single reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms
        to yield an isomeric product. An example is the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate into its
        constitutional isomer glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a step in the glycolysis pathway by which carbohydrates
        are metabolized.

                 (c) H2C CH2 + H2 CH3CH3

6.2 How Organic Reactions Occur: Mechanisms

Having looked at the kinds of reactions that take place, let's now see how they occur. An overall description of
how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes
place at each stage of a chemical transformation--which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds
are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also
account for all reactants used and all products formed.

All chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react,
and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product
molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A
bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product
fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so
that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic,
and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.

We'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the
unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( ), whereas the movement of one
electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or "fishhook," arrow ( ).

Just as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond
can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the
new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.

Processes that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar
reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their
orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry,
and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.

Processes that involve symmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called radical reactions. A radical,
often called a free radical, is a neutral chemical species that contains an odd number of electrons and thus has
a single, unpaired electron in one of its orbitals.

In addition to polar and radical reactions, there is a third, less commonly encountered process called a
pericyclic reaction. Rather than explain pericyclic reactions now, though, we'll look at them more carefully in
Chapter 30.

6.3 Polar Reactions

Polar reactions occur because of the electrical attraction between positively polarized and negatively polarized
centers on functional groups in molecules. To see how these reactions take place, let's first recall the discussion
of polar covalent bonds in Section 2.1 and then look more deeply into the effects of bond polarity on organic
molecules.

Most organic compounds are electrically neutral; they have no net charge, either positive or negative. We saw
in Section 2.1, however, that certain bonds within a molecule, particularly the bonds in functional groups, are
polar. Bond polarity is a consequence of an unsymmetrical electron distribution in a bond and is due to the
difference in electronegativity of the bonded atoms.
174  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     Elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and chlorine are more electronegative than carbon, so a carbon
     atom bonded to one of these atoms has a partial positive charge (+). Metals are less electronegative than
     carbon, so a carbon atom bonded to a metal has a partial negative charge (-). Electrostatic potential maps

     of chloromethane and methyllithium illustrate these charge distributions, showing that the carbon atom in

     chloromethane is electron-poor (blue) while the carbon in methyllithium is electron-rich (red).

     The polarity patterns of some common functional groups are shown in TABLE 6.1. Note that carbon is always
     positively polarized except when bonded to a metal.

                                                         TABLE 6.1 Polarity Patterns in Some Common Functional

TABLE 6.1 Polarity Patterns in Some Common Functional
Groups

  Compound type Functional group structure

This discussion of bond polarity is oversimplified in that we've considered only bonds that are inherently
polar due to differences in electronegativity. Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional
groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon
atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond. On
protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons
in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous
examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond
polarity upon protonation.
176  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     Yet a further consideration is the polarizability (as opposed to polarity) of atoms in a molecule. As the electric
     field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules
     nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external
     electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are
     more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more
     polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability
     of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to
     electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.

     What does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract,
     the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor
     sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and
     bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.
     As we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a
     curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds
     are formed during the reaction.

     In referring to the electron-rich and electron-poor species involved in polar reactions, chemists use the words
     nucleophile and electrophile. A nucleophile is a substance that is "nucleus-loving." (Remember that a nucleus
     is positively charged.) A nucleophile has a negatively polarized, electron-rich atom and can form a bond by
     donating a pair of electrons to a positively polarized, electron-poor atom. Nucleophiles can be either neutral
     or negatively charged; ammonia, water, hydroxide ion, and chloride ion are examples. An electrophile, by
     contrast, is "electron-loving." An electrophile has a positively polarized, electron-poor atom and can form a
     bond by accepting a pair of electrons from a nucleophile. Electrophiles can be either neutral or positively
     charged. Acids (H+ donors), alkyl halides, and carbonyl compounds are examples (FIGURE 6.2).

FIGURE 6.2 Some nucleophiles and electrophiles. Electrostatic potential maps identify the nucleophilic (negative) and electrophilic
(positive) atoms.

Note that neutral compounds can often react either as nucleophiles or as electrophiles, depending on the
circumstances. After all, if a compound is neutral yet has an electron-rich nucleophilic site, it must also have a
corresponding electron-poor electrophilic site. Water, for instance, acts as an electrophile when it donates H+
but acts as a nucleophile when it donates a nonbonding pair of electrons. Similarly, a carbonyl compound acts
as an electrophile when it reacts at its positively polarized carbon atom, yet acts as a nucleophile when it reacts
at its negatively polarized oxygen atom.

If the definitions of nucleophiles and electrophiles sound similar to those given in Section 2.11 for Lewis acids
and Lewis bases, that's because there is indeed a correlation. Lewis bases are electron donors and behave as
nucleophiles, whereas Lewis acids are electron acceptors and behave as electrophiles. Thus, much of organic
chemistry is explainable in terms of acid-base reactions. The main difference is that the words acid and base
are used broadly in all fields of chemistry, while the words nucleophile and electrophile are used primarily in
organic chemistry when carbon bonding is involved.

Identifying Electrophiles and Nucleophiles

Which of the following species is likely to behave as a nucleophile and which as an electrophile?
(a) NO2+ (b) CN- (c) CH3NH2 (d) (CH3)3S+

Strategy

A nucleophile has an electron-rich site, either because it is negatively charged or because it has a functional
group containing an atom that has a lone pair of electrons. An electrophile has an electron-poor site, either
because it is positively charged or because it has a functional group containing an atom that is positively
polarized.

Solution

(a) NO2+ (nitronium ion) is likely to be an electrophile because it is positively charged.

(b)       (cyanide ion) is likely to be a nucleophile because it is negatively charged.

     (c) CH3NH2 (methylamine) might be either a nucleophile or an electrophile, depending on the circumstances.
     The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom makes methylamine a potential nucleophile, while positively
     polarized N-H hydrogens make methylamine a potential acid (electrophile).

     6.4 An Example of a Polar Reaction: Addition of HBr to Ethylene

     Let's look at a typical polar process--the addition reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with hydrogen
     bromide. When ethylene is treated with HBr at room temperature, bromoethane is produced. Overall, the
     reaction can be formulated as

     The reaction is an example of a polar reaction type known as an electrophilic addition reaction and can
     be understood using the general ideas discussed in the previous section. Let's begin by looking at the two
     reactants.

     What do we know about ethylene? We know from Section 1.8 that a carbon-carbon double bond results from the
     orbital overlap of two sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. The  part of the double bond results from sp2-sp2 overlap,

     and the  part results from p-p overlap.

     What kind of chemical reactivity might we expect from a  bond? We know that alkanes, such as ethane, are

     relatively inert because all valence electrons are tied up in strong, nonpolar, C-C and C-H bonds. Furthermore,

     the bonding electrons in alkanes are relatively inaccessible to approaching reactants because they are sheltered
     in  bonds between nuclei. The electronic situation in alkenes is quite different, however. For one thing, double

bonds have a greater electron density than single bonds--four electrons in a double bond versus only two in a
single bond. In addition, the electrons in the  bond are accessible to approaching reactants because they are
located above and below the plane of the double bond rather than being sheltered between the nuclei (FIGURE
6.3). As a result, the double bond is nucleophilic and the chemistry of alkenes is dominated by reactions with
electrophiles.

FIGURE 6.3 A comparison of carbon-carbon single and double bonds. A double bond is both more accessible to approaching reactants
than a single bond and more electron-rich (more nucleophilic). An electrostatic potential map of ethylene indicates that the double bond is
the region of highest negative charge.

What about the second reactant, HBr? As a strong acid, HBr is a powerful proton (H+) donor and electrophile.
Thus, the reaction between HBr and ethylene is a typical electrophile-nucleophile combination, characteristic
of all polar reactions.

We'll see more details about alkene electrophilic addition reactions shortly, but for the present we can imagine

the reaction as taking place by the pathway shown in FIGURE 6.4. The reaction begins when the alkene

nucleophile donates a pair of electrons from its  bond to HBr to form a new C-H bond plus Br-, as indicated

by the path of the curved arrows in the first step of FIGURE 6.4. One curved arrow begins at the middle of the

double bond (the source of the electron pair) and points to the hydrogen atom in HBr (the atom to which a

bond will form). This arrow indicates that a new C-H bond forms using electrons from the former  bond.

Simultaneously, a second curved arrow begins in the middle of the H-Br bond and points to the Br, indicating
that the H-Br bond breaks and the electrons remain with the Br atom, giving Br-.

     The electrophilic addition reaction of ethylene and HBr. The reaction takes place
     in two steps, both of which involve electrophile-nucleophile interactions.

     When one of the alkene carbon atoms bonds to the incoming hydrogen, the other carbon atom, having lost its
     share of the double-bond electrons, now has only six valence electrons and is left with a positive charge. This
     positively charged species--a carbon-cation, or carbocation--is itself an electrophile that can accept an electron
     pair from nucleophilic Br- anion in a second step, forming a C-Br bond and yielding the observed addition
     product. Once again, a curved arrow in FIGURE 6.4 shows the electron-pair movement from Br- to the positively
     charged carbon.
     The electrophilic addition of HBr to ethylene is only one example of a polar process; there are many others that
     we'll study in depth in later chapters. But regardless of the details of individual reactions, all polar reactions
     take place between an electron-poor site and an electron-rich site and involve the donation of an electron pair
     from a nucleophile to an electrophile.

6.5 Using Curved Arrows in Polar Reaction Mechanisms

It takes practice to use curved arrows properly in reaction mechanisms, but there are a few rules and a few
common patterns you should look for that will help you become more proficient:
RULE 1
Electrons move from a nucleophilic source (Nu: or Nu:-) to an electrophilic sink (E or E+). The nucleophilic
source must have an electron pair available, usually either as a lone pair or in a multiple bond. For example:

The electrophilic sink must be able to accept an electron pair, usually because it has either a positively charged
atom or a positively polarized atom in a functional group. For example:

RULE 2
The nucleophile can be either negatively charged or neutral. If the nucleophile is negatively charged, the
atom that donates an electron pair becomes neutral. For example:

If the nucleophile is neutral, the atom that donates the electron pair acquires a positive charge. For example:

RULE 3
The electrophile can be either positively charged or neutral. If the electrophile is positively charged, the atom
bearing that charge becomes neutral after accepting an electron pair. For example:

If the electrophile is neutral, the atom that ultimately accepts the electron pair acquires a negative charge. For
this to happen, however, the negative charge must be stabilized by being on an electronegative atom such as
oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen. Carbon and hydrogen do not typically stabilize a negative charge. For example:
182  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     The result of Rules 2 and 3 together is that charge is conserved during the reaction. A negative charge in one of
     the reactants gives a negative charge in one of the products, and a positive charge in one of the reactants gives
     a positive charge in one of the products.

     RULE 4

     The octet rule must be followed. That is, no second-row atom can be left with ten electrons (or four for

     hydrogen). If an electron pair moves to an atom that already has an octet (or two electrons for hydrogen),

     another electron pair must simultaneously move from that atom to maintain the octet. When two electrons

     move from the   bond of ethylene to the hydrogen atom of H3O+, for instance, two electrons must leave

     that hydrogen. This means that the H-O bond must break and the electrons must stay with the oxygen, giving

     neutral water.

     Worked Example 6.2 gives another example of drawing curved arrows.

             WORKED EXAMPLE 6.2
     Using Curved Arrows in Reaction Mechanisms

     Add curved arrows to the following polar reaction to show the flow of electrons:

     Strategy
     Look at the reaction, and identify the bonding changes that have occurred. In this case, a C-Br bond has broken
     and a C-C bond has formed. The formation of the C-C bond involves donation of an electron pair from the
     nucleophilic carbon atom of the reactant on the left to the electrophilic carbon atom of CH3Br, so we draw a
     curved arrow originating from the lone pair on the negatively charged C atom and pointing to the C atom of
     CH3Br. At the same time that the C-C bond forms, the C-Br bond must break so that the octet rule is not violated.
     We therefore draw a second curved arrow from the C-Br bond to Br. The bromine is now a stable Br- ion.

6.6 Radical Reactions

Radical reactions are much less common than polar reactions but are nevertheless important in some
industrial processes and biological pathways. We'll look at them in more detail in Sections 10.2 and 10.3 but
will briefly see how they occur at this point.
A radical is highly reactive because it contains an atom with an odd number of electrons (usually seven) in
its valence shell, rather than a noble-gas octet. The radical can achieve a valence-shell octet in several ways
however. For instance, it might abstract an atom and one bonding electron from another reactant, leaving
behind a new radical. The net result is a radical substitution reaction.

Alternatively, a reactant radical might add to a double bond, taking one electron from the double bond and
yielding a new radical. The net result is a radical addition reaction.

An example of an industrially useful radical reaction is the reaction of chlorine with methane to yield
chloromethane, which is used to manufacture the solvents dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and chloroform (CHCl3).
The process begins with irradiation of Cl2 with ultraviolet light to break the relatively weak Cl-Cl bond of Cl2
and produce chlorine radicals (·Cl).
184  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     Chlorine radicals then react with methane by abstracting a hydrogen atom to give HCl and a methyl radical
     (·CH3) that reacts further with Cl2 to give chloromethane plus a new chlorine radical that cycles back and
     repeats the first step. Thus, once the sequence has started, it becomes a self-sustaining cycle of repeating steps
     (a) and (b), making the overall process a chain reaction.

     As a biological example of a radical reaction, look at the synthesis of prostaglandins, a large class of molecules
     found in virtually all body tissues and fluids. A number of pharmaceuticals are based on or derived from
     prostaglandins, including medicines that induce labor during childbirth, reduce intraocular pressure in
     glaucoma, control bronchial asthma, and help treat congenital heart defects.

     Prostaglandin biosynthesis is initiated by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from arachidonic acid by an
     iron-oxygen radical, thereby generating a carbon radical in a substitution reaction. Don't be intimidated by the
     size of the molecules; focus on the changes that occur in each step. (To help you do that, the unchanged part of
     the molecule is "ghosted," with only the reactive part clearly visible.)

     Following the initial abstraction of a hydrogen atom, the carbon radical then reacts with O2 to give an oxygen

     radical, which reacts with a          bond within the same molecule in an addition reaction. Several further

     transformations ultimately yield prostaglandin H2.

PROBLEM Using curved fishhook arrows, propose a mechanism for the formation of the cyclopentane ring of
          6-9 prostaglandin H2.

6.7 Describing a Reaction: Equilibria, Rates, and Energy Changes

Every chemical reaction can go in either a forward or reverse direction. Reactants can go forward to products,
and products can revert to reactants. As you may remember from your general chemistry course, the position of
the resulting chemical equilibrium is expressed by an equation in which Keq, the equilibrium constant, is equal
to the product concentrations multiplied together, divided by the reactant concentrations multiplied together,
with each concentration raised to the power of its coefficient in the balanced equation. For the generalized
reaction

we have

The value of the equilibrium constant tells which side of the reaction arrow is energetically favored. If Keq is
much larger than 1, then the product concentration term [C]c[D]d is much larger than the reactant concentration
term [A]a[B]b, and the reaction proceeds as written from left to right. If Keq is near 1, appreciable amounts of
both reactant and product are present at equilibrium. And if Keq is much smaller than 1, the reaction does not
take place as written but instead goes in the reverse direction, from right to left.

In the reaction of ethylene with HBr, for example, we can write the following equilibrium expression and
determine experimentally that the equilibrium constant at room temperature is approximately 7.1 × 107:

Because Keq is relatively large, the reaction proceeds as written and more than 99.999 99% of the ethylene is
converted into bromoethane. For practical purposes, an equilibrium constant greater than about 103 means
that the amount of reactant left over will be barely detectable (less than 0.1%).

What determines the magnitude of the equilibrium constant? For a reaction to have a favorable equilibrium
constant and proceed as written, the energy of the products must be lower than the energy of the reactants. In
other words, energy must be released. This situation is analogous to that of a rock poised precariously in a high-
energy position near the top of a hill. When it rolls downhill, the rock releases energy until it reaches a more
stable, low-energy position at the bottom.
The energy change that occurs during a chemical reaction is called the Gibbs free-energy change (G), which
is equal to the free energy of the products minus the free energy of the reactants: G = Gproducts - Greactants. For
a favorable reaction, G has a negative value, meaning that energy is lost by the chemical system and released
to the surroundings, usually as heat. Such reactions are said to be exergonic. For an unfavorable reaction, G
has a positive value, meaning that energy is absorbed by the chemical system from the surroundings. Such
reactions are said to be endergonic.

You might also recall from general chemistry that the standard free-energy change for a reaction is denoted
as G°, where the superscript ° means that the reaction is carried out under standard conditions, with pure
substances in their most stable form at 1 atm pressure and a specified temperature, usually 298 K. For
biological reactions, the standard free-energy change is denoted as G° and refers to a reaction carried out at
186  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     pH = 7.0 with solute concentrations of 1.0 M.

     Because the equilibrium constant, Keq, and the standard free-energy change, G°, both measure whether a
     reaction is favorable, they are mathematically related by the equation

     where

     For example, the reaction of ethylene with HBr has Keq = 7.1 × 107, so G° = -44.8 kJ/mol (-10.7 kcal/mol) at
     298 K:

     The free-energy change G is made up of two terms, an enthalpy term, H, and a temperature-dependent
     entropy term, TS. Of the two terms, the enthalpy term is often larger and more dominant.

     For the reaction of ethylene with HBr at room temperature (298 K), the approximate values are

     The enthalpy change (H), also called the heat of reaction, is a measure of the change in total bonding energy
     during a reaction. If H is negative, as in the reaction of HBr with ethylene, the products have less energy than
     the reactants. Thus, the products are more stable and have stronger bonds than the reactants, heat is released,
     and the reaction is said to be exothermic. If H is positive, the products are less stable and have weaker bonds
     than the reactants, heat is absorbed, and the reaction is said to be endothermic. For example, if a reaction
     breaks reactant bonds with a total strength of 380 kJ/mol and forms product bonds with a total strength of 400
     kJ/mol, then H for the reaction is 400 kJ/mol - 380 kJ/mol = -20 kJ/mol and the reaction is exothermic.
     The entropy change (S) is a measure of the change in the amount of molecular randomness, or freedom of
     motion, that accompanies a reaction. For example, in an elimination reaction of the type

     there is more freedom of movement and molecular randomness in the products than in the reactant because
     one molecule has split into two. Thus, there is a net increase in entropy during the reaction and S has a positive
     value.
     On the other hand, for an addition reaction of the type

                                                                  6.8 · Describing a Reaction: Bond Dissociation Energies  187

the opposite is true. Because such reactions restrict the freedom of movement of two molecules by joining
them together, the product has less randomness than the reactants and S has a negative value. The reaction
of ethylene and HBr to yield bromoethane, which has S° = -0.132 kJ/(K · mol), is an example. TABLE 6.2

describes the thermodynamic terms more fully.

TABLE 6.2 Explanation of Thermodynamic Quantities: G° = H° - TS°

Term Name          Explanation

G° Gibbs           The energy difference between reactants and products. When G° is negative, the reaction
           free-   is exergonic, has a favorable equilibrium constant, and can occur spontaneously. When G°
           energy  is positive, the reaction is endergonic, has an unfavorable equilibrium constant, and cannot
           change  occur spontaneously.

H° Enthalpy The heat of reaction, or difference in strength between the bonds broken in a reaction and
           change the bonds formed. When H° is negative, the reaction releases heat and is exothermic.
                           When H° is positive, the reaction absorbs heat and is endothermic.

S° Entropy The change in molecular randomness during a reaction. When S° is negative, randomness
           change decreases. When S° is positive, randomness increases.

Knowing the value of Keq for a reaction is useful, but it's important to realize its limitations. An equilibrium
constant tells only the position of the equilibrium, or how much product is theoretically possible. It doesn't tell
the rate of reaction, or how fast the equilibrium is established. Some reactions are extremely slow even though
they have favorable equilibrium constants. Gasoline is stable at room temperature, for instance, because the
rate of its reaction with oxygen is slow at 298 K. Only at higher temperatures, such as contact with a lighted
match, does gasoline react rapidly with oxygen and undergo complete conversion to the equilibrium products
water and carbon dioxide. Rates (how fast a reaction occurs) and equilibria (how much a reaction occurs) are
entirely different.

        6-10 mol?

PROBLEM Which reaction is more exergonic, one with Keq = 1000 or one with Keq = 0.001?
        6-11

6.8 Describing a Reaction: Bond Dissociation Energies

We've just seen that heat is released (negative H) when a bond is formed because the products are more stable
and have stronger bonds than the reactants. Conversely, heat is absorbed (positive H) when a bond is broken
because the products are less stable and have weaker bonds than the reactants. The amount of energy needed to
break a given bond to produce two radical fragments when the molecule is in the gas phase at 25 °C is a quantity
called the bond strength, or bond dissociation energy (D).

Each specific bond has its own characteristic strength, and extensive tables of such data are available. For
example, a C-H bond in methane has a bond dissociation energy D = 439.3 kJ/mol (105.0 kcal/mol), meaning
that 439.3 kJ/mol must be added to break a C-H bond of methane to give the two radical fragments ·CH3 and
·H. Conversely, 439.3 kJ/mol of energy is released when a methyl radical and a hydrogen atom combine to form
methane. TABLE 6.3 lists some other bond strengths.

Think again about the connection between bond strengths and chemical reactivity. In an exothermic reaction,
more heat is released than is absorbed. But because making bonds in the products releases heat and breaking
bonds in the reactants absorbs heat, the bonds in the products must be stronger than the bonds in the reactants.
In other words, exothermic reactions are favored by products with strong bonds and by reactants with weak,
easily broken bonds.

Sometimes, particularly in biochemistry, reactive substances that undergo highly exothermic reactions, such
as ATP (adenosine triphosphate), are referred to as "energy-rich" or "high-energy" compounds. Such a label
doesn't mean that ATP is special or different from other compounds, it only means that ATP has relatively weak
bonds that require a relatively small amount of heat to break, thus leading to a larger release of heat when a
strong new bond forms in a reaction. When a typical organic phosphate such as glycerol 3-phosphate reacts
with water, for instance, only 9 kJ/mol of heat is released (H° = -9 kJ/mol), but when ATP reacts with water,
30 kJ/mol of heat is released (H° = -30 kJ/mol). The difference between the two reactions is due to the fact
that the bond broken in ATP is substantially weaker than the bond broken in glycerol 3-phosphate. We'll see the
metabolic importance of this reaction in later chapters.

6.9 Describing a Reaction: Energy Diagrams and Transition States

For a reaction to take place, reactant molecules must collide and reorganization of atoms and bonds must occur.
Let's again look at the addition reaction of HBr and ethylene.
190  6 · An Overview of Organic Reactions

     As the reaction proceeds, ethylene and HBr approach each other, the ethylene  bond and the H-Br bond break,
     a new C-H bond forms in step 1 and a new C-Br bond forms in step 2.

     To depict graphically the energy changes that occur during a reaction, chemists use energy diagrams, such
     as that in FIGURE 6.5. The vertical axis of the diagram represents the total energy of all reactants, and the
     horizontal axis, called the reaction coordinate, represents the progress of the reaction from beginning to end.
     Let's see how the addition of HBr to ethylene can be described in an energy diagram.

     FIGURE 6.5 An energy diagram for the first step in the reaction of ethylene with HBr. The energy difference between reactants and the
     transition state, G, defines the reaction rate. The energy difference between reactants and carbocation product, G°, defines the position
     of the equilibrium.

     At the beginning of the reaction, ethylene and HBr have the total amount of energy indicated by the reactant
     level on the left side of the diagram in FIGURE 6.5. As the two reactants collide and reaction commences, their
     electron clouds repel each other, causing the energy level to rise. If the collision has occurred with enough force
     and proper orientation, however, the reactants continue to approach each other despite the rising repulsion
     until the new C-H bond starts to form. At some point, a structure of maximum energy is reached, a structure
     called the transition state.

     The transition state represents the highest-energy structure involved in this step of the reaction. It is unstable
     and can't be isolated, but we can imagine it to be an activated complex of the two reactants in which both the

             bond and H-Br bond are partially broken and the new C-H bond is partially formed (FIGURE 6.6).

     FIGURE 6.6 A hypothetical transition-state structure for the first step of the reaction of ethylene with HBr. The   bond and H-Br
     bond are just beginning to break, and the C-H bond is just beginning to form.

     The energy difference between reactants and the transition state is called the activation energy, G, and
     determines how rapidly the reaction occurs at a given temperature. (The double-dagger superscript, , always

refers to the transition state.) A high activation energy results in a slow reaction because few collisions occur
with enough energy for the reactants to reach the transition state. A low activation energy results in a rapid
reaction because almost all collisions occur with enough energy for the reactants to reach the transition state.

As an analogy, you might think of reactants that need enough energy to climb the activation barrier to the
transition state as hikers who need enough energy to climb to the top of a mountain pass. If the pass is a high
one, the hikers need a lot of energy and surmount the barrier with difficulty. If the pass is low, the hikers need
less energy and reach the top easily.

As a rough generalization, many organic reactions have activation energies in the range 40 to 150 kJ/mol
(10-35 kcal/mol). The reaction of ethylene with HBr, for example, has an activation energy of approximately
140 kJ/mol (34 kcal/mol). Reactions with activation energies less than 80 kJ/mol take place at or below room
temperature, while reactions with higher activation energies normally require a higher temperature to give the
reactants enough energy to climb the activation barrier.

Once the transition state is reached, the reaction can either continue on to give the carbocation product or
revert back to reactants. When reversion to reactants occurs, the transition-state structure comes apart and
an amount of free energy corresponding to -G is released. When the reaction continues on to give the
carbocation, the new C-H bond forms fully and an amount of energy is released corresponding to the difference
between the transition state and carbocation product. The net energy change for the step, G°, is represented in
the diagram as the difference in level between reactant and product. Since the carbocation is higher in energy
than the starting alkene, the step is endergonic, has a positive value of G°, and absorbs energy.

Not all energy diagrams are like that shown for the reaction of ethylene and HBr. Each reaction has its own
energy profile. Some reactions are fast (small G) and some are slow (large G); some have a negative G°,
and some have a positive G°. FIGURE 6.7 illustrates some different possibilities.

FIGURE 6.7 Some hypothetical energy diagrams: (a) a fast exergonic reaction (low G, negative G°); (b) a slow exergonic reaction (high
G, negative G°); (c) a fast endergonic reaction (small G, small positive G°); (d) a slow endergonic reaction (high G, positive G°).

     6.10 Describing a Reaction: Intermediates

     How can we describe the carbocation formed in the first step of the reaction of ethylene with HBr? The
     carbocation is clearly different from the reactants, yet it isn't a transition state and it isn't a final product.

     We call the carbocation, which exists only transiently during the course of the multistep reaction, a reaction
     intermediate. As soon as the intermediate is formed in the first step by reaction of ethylene with H+, it reacts
     further with Br- in a second step to give the final product, bromoethane. This second step has its own activation
     energy (G), its own transition state, and its own energy change (G°). We can picture the second transition
     state as an activated complex between the electrophilic carbocation intermediate and the nucleophilic bromide
     anion, in which Br- donates a pair of electrons to the positively charged carbon atom as the new C-Br bond just
     starts to form.

     A complete energy diagram for the overall reaction of ethylene with HBr is shown in FIGURE 6.8. In essence,
     we draw a diagram for each of the individual steps and then join them so that the carbocation product of step
     1 is the reactant for step 2. As indicated in FIGURE 6.8, the reaction intermediate lies at an energy minimum
     between steps. Because the energy level of the intermediate is higher than the level of either the reactant that
     formed it or the product it yields, the intermediate can't normally be isolated. It is, however, more stable than its
     two neighboring transition states.

     FIGURE 6.8 An energy diagram for the reaction of ethylene with HBr. Two separate steps are involved, each with its own activation energy
     (G) and free-energy change (G°). The overall G for the complete reaction is the energy difference between reactants and the highest
     transition state (which corresponds to G1 in this case), and the overall G° for the reaction is the energy difference between reactants and
     final products.

     Each step in a multistep process can always be considered separately. Each step has its own G and its own
     G°. The overall activation energy that controls the rate of the reaction, however, is the energy difference
     between initial reactants and the highest transition state, regardless of which step it occurs in. The overall G°
     of the reaction is the energy difference between reactants and final products.

     The biological reactions that take place in living organisms have the same energy requirements as reactions
     that take place in the laboratory and can be described in similar ways. They are, however, constrained by the fact
     that they must have low enough activation energies to occur at moderate temperatures, and they must release

energy in relatively small amounts to avoid overheating the organism. These constraints can be met through
the use of large, structurally complex, enzyme catalysts that alter the mechanism of a reaction to a pathway that
can proceed through a series of small steps rather than one or two large steps. Thus, an energy diagram for a
biological reaction might look like that in FIGURE 6.9.

     6.11 A Comparison Between Biological Reactions and Laboratory Reactions

     Beginning in the next chapter, we'll be seeing a lot of reactions, some that are important in laboratory chemistry
     yet don't occur in nature and others that have counterparts in biological pathways. In comparing laboratory
     reactions with biological reactions, several differences are apparent. For one, laboratory reactions are usually
     carried out in an organic solvent such as diethyl ether or dichloromethane to dissolve the reactants and
     bring them into contact, whereas biological reactions occur in the aqueous medium within cells. For another,
     laboratory reactions often take place over a wide range of temperatures without catalysts, while biological
     reactions take place at the temperature of the organism and are catalyzed by enzymes.
     We'll look at enzymes in more detail in Section 26.10, but you may already be aware that an enzyme is a large,
     globular, protein molecule that contains in its structure a protected pocket called its active site. The active
     site is lined by acidic or basic groups as needed for catalysis and has precisely the right shape to bind and
     hold a substrate molecule in the orientation necessary for reaction. FIGURE 6.10 shows a molecular model of
     hexokinase, along with an X-ray crystal structure of the glucose substrate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
     bound in the active site. Hexokinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of glucose metabolism--the
     transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to glucose, giving glucose 6-phosphate and ADP. The structures of ATP
     and ADP were shown at the end of Section 6.8.

     Note how the hexokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation reaction of glucose is written. It's common when writing
     biological equations to show only the structures of the primary reactant and product, while abbreviating the
     structures of various biological "reagents" and by-products such as ATP and ADP. A curved arrow intersecting
     the straight reaction arrow indicates that ATP is also a reactant and ADP also a product.

FIGURE 6.10 Models of hexokinase in space-filling and wire-frame formats, showing the cleft that contains the active site where
substrate binding and reaction catalysis occur. At the bottom is an X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme active site, showing the positions
of both glucose and ADP as well as a lysine amino acid that acts as a base to deprotonate glucose.

Yet a third difference between laboratory and biological reactions is that laboratory reactions are often done
using relatively small, simple reagents such as Br2, HCl, NaBH4, CrO3, and so forth, while biological reactions
usually involve relatively complex "reagents" called coenzymes. In the hexokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation
of glucose just shown, ATP is the coenzyme. As another example, compare the H2 molecule, a laboratory
reagent that adds to a carbon-carbon double bond to yield an alkane, with the reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NADH) molecule, a coenzyme that effects an analogous addition of hydrogen to a double bond
in many biological pathways. Of all the atoms in the coenzyme, only the one hydrogen atom shown in red is
transferred to the double-bond substrate.

Don't be intimidated by the size of the ATP or NADH molecule; most of the structure is there to provide an overall
shape for binding to the enzyme and to provide appropriate solubility behavior. When looking at biological
molecules, focus on the small part of the molecule where the chemical change takes place.
One final difference between laboratory and biological reactions is in their specificity. A catalyst might be used
in the laboratory to catalyze the reaction of thousands of different substances, but an enzyme, because it can
only bind a specific substrate molecule having a specific shape, will usually catalyze only a specific reaction. It's
this exquisite specificity that makes biological chemistry so remarkable and that makes life possible. TABLE 6.4
summarizes some of the differences between laboratory and biological reactions.

Where Do Drugs Come From?

It has been estimated that major pharmaceutical companies in the United States spent some $200 billion on
drug research and development in 2020, while government agencies and private foundations spent another $28
billion. What does this money buy? From 1983 to 2022, the money resulted in a total of 1237 new molecular
entities (NMEs)--new biologically active chemical substances approved for sale as drugs by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).
Where do the new drugs come from? According to a study carried out several years ago at the U.S. National
Cancer Institute, only about 33% of new drugs are entirely synthetic and completely unrelated to any naturally
occurring substance. The remaining 67% take their lead, to a greater or lesser extent, from nature. Vaccines and
genetically engineered proteins of biological origin account for 15% of NMEs, but most new drugs come from
natural products, a catchall term generally taken to mean small molecules found in bacteria, plants, algae, and
other living organisms. Unmodified natural products isolated directly from the producing organism account
for 24% of NMEs, while natural products that have been chemically modified in the laboratory account for the
remaining 28%.

Many years of work go into screening many thousands of substances to identify a single compound that might
ultimately gain approval as an NME. But after that single compound has been identified, the work has just begun
because it takes an average of 9 to 10 years for a drug to make it through the approval process. First, the safety
of the drug in animals must be demonstrated and an economical method of manufacture must be devised. With
these preliminaries out of the way, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is submitted to the FDA for
permission to begin testing in humans.

come from? (credit: modification of work "COVIran Barekat vaccine production" by Sadegh Nikgostar/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)

Human testing takes, or should take, 5 to 7 years and is divided into three phases. Phase I clinical trials are
198 6 · Key Terms

carried out on a small group of healthy volunteers to establish safety and look for side effects. Several months
to a year are needed, and only about 70% of drugs pass at this point. Phase II clinical trials next test the drug
for 1 to 2 years in several hundred patients with the target disease or condition, looking both for safety and
efficacy, and only about 33% of the original group pass. Finally, phase III trials are undertaken on a large sample
of patients to document definitively the drug's safety, dosage, and efficacy. If the drug is one of the 25% of the
original group that make it to the end of phase III, all the data are then gathered into a New Drug Application
(NDA) and sent to the FDA for review and approval, which can take another 2 years. Ten years have elapsed
and at least $500 million has been spent, with only a 20% success rate for the drugs that began testing. Finally,
though, the drug will begin to appear in medicine cabinets. The following timeline shows the process.

Summary

All chemical reactions, whether in the laboratory or in living organisms, follow the same chemical rules. To
understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and
how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic
reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.

There are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to
give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products;
substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and
rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give
an isomeric product.

A full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms
by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more
common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one
molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction
when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a
curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions
involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one

electron.

The energy changes that take place during reactions can be described by considering both rates (how fast
the reactions occur) and equilibria (how much the reactions occur). The position of a chemical equilibrium
is determined by the value of the free-energy change (G) for the reaction, where G = H - TS. The
enthalpy term (H) corresponds to the net change in strength of chemical bonds broken and formed during
the reaction; the entropy term (S) corresponds to the change in the amount of molecular randomness during
the reaction. Reactions that have negative values of G release energy, are said to be exergonic, and have
favorable equilibria. Reactions that have positive values of G absorb energy, are said to be endergonic, and
have unfavorable equilibria.

A reaction can be described pictorially using an energy diagram that follows the reaction course from reactants
through transition state to product. The transition state is an activated complex occurring at the highest-
energy point of a reaction. The amount of energy needed by reactants to reach this high point is the activation
energy, G. The higher the activation energy, the slower the reaction.

Many reactions take place in more than one step and involve the formation of a reaction intermediate. An
intermediate is a species that lies at an energy minimum between steps on the reaction curve and is formed
briefly during the course of a reaction.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Carbon-carbon double bonds are present in most organic and biological molecules, so a
good understanding of their behavior is needed. In this chapter, we'll look at some consequences of alkene
stereoisomerism and then focus on the broadest and most general class of alkene reactions, the electrophilic
addition reaction. Carbon-carbon triple bonds, by contrast, occur much less commonly, so we'll not spend much
time on their chemistry.
An alkene, sometimes called an olefin from the German term for oil forming, is a hydrocarbon that contains
a carbon-carbon double bond, while an alkyne is a hydrocarbon that contains a carbon-carbon triple bond.
Alkenes occur abundantly in nature. Ethylene, for instance, is a plant hormone that induces ripening in fruit,
and -pinene is the major component of turpentine. Lycopene, found in fruits such as watermelon and papaya

     as well as tomatoes, is an antioxidant with numerous health benefits such as sun protection and cardiovascular
     protection.

     7.1 Industrial Preparation and Use of Alkenes

     Ethylene and propylene, the simplest alkenes, are the two most important organic chemicals produced
     industrially. Approximately 220 million tons of ethylene and 138 million tons of propylene are produced
     worldwide each year for use in the synthesis of polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene glycol, acetic acid,
     acetaldehyde, and a host of other substances (FIGURE 7.2).

                                               FIGURE 7.2 Compounds derived industrially from ethylene and propylene.

     Ethylene, propylene, and butene are synthesized from (C2-C8) alkanes by a process called steam cracking at
     temperatures up to 900 °C.

     The cracking process is complex, although it undoubtedly involves radical reactions. The high-temperature

7.2 · Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation                                                                        209

reaction conditions cause spontaneous breaking of C-C and C-H bonds, with the resultant formation of smaller
fragments. We might imagine, for instance, that a molecule of butane splits into two ethyl radicals, each of which
then loses a hydrogen atom to generate two molecules of ethylene.

Steam cracking is an example of a reaction whose energetics are dominated by entropy (S°) rather than by
enthalpy (H°) in the free-energy equation G° = H° - TS° discussed in Section 6.7. Although the bond
dissociation energy D for a carbon-carbon single bond is relatively high (about 370 kJ/mol) and cracking is
endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into
several smaller pieces, together with the high temperature, makes the TS° term larger than the H° term,
thereby favoring the cracking reaction.

7.2 Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation

Because of its double bond, an alkene has fewer hydrogens than an alkane with the same number of
carbons--CnH2n for an alkene versus CnH2n+2 for an alkane--and is therefore referred to as unsaturated.
Ethylene, for example, has the formula C2H4, whereas ethane has the formula C2H6.

In general, each ring or double bond in a molecule corresponds to a loss of two hydrogens from the alkane
formula CnH2n+2. Knowing this relationship, it's possible to work backward from a molecular formula to
calculate a molecule's degree of unsaturation--the number of rings and/or multiple bonds present in the
molecule.

Let's assume that we want to find the structure of an unknown hydrocarbon. A molecular weight determination
yields a value of 82 amu, which corresponds to a molecular formula of C6H10. Since the saturated C6 alkane
(hexane) has the formula C6H14, the unknown compound has two fewer pairs of hydrogens (H14 - H10 = H4 =
2 H2) so its degree of unsaturation is 2. The unknown therefore contains either two double bonds, one ring and
one double bond, two rings, or one triple bond. There's still a long way to go to establish its structure, but the
simple calculation has told us a lot about the molecule.

Similar calculations can be carried out for compounds containing elements other than just carbon and
hydrogen.

  · Organohalogen compounds (C, H, X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I) A halogen substituent acts as a replacement
      for hydrogen in an organic molecule, so we can add the number of halogens and hydrogens to arrive at
      an equivalent hydrocarbon formula from which the degree of unsaturation can be found. For example, the
      formula C4H6Br2 is equivalent to the hydrocarbon formula C4H8 and thus corresponds to one degree of
      unsaturation.
210  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     · Organooxygen compounds (C, H, O) Oxygen forms two bonds, so it doesn't affect the formula of an
        equivalent hydrocarbon and can be ignored when calculating the degree of unsaturation. You can convince
        yourself of this by seeing what happens when an oxygen atom is inserted into an alkane bond: C-C becomes
        C-O-C or C-H becomes C-O-H, and there is no change in the number of hydrogen atoms. For example,
        the formula C5H8O is equivalent to the hydrocarbon formula C5H8 and thus corresponds to two degrees of
        unsaturation.

     · Organonitrogen compounds (C, H, N) Nitrogen forms three bonds, so an organonitrogen compound has
        one more hydrogen than a related hydrocarbon. We therefore subtract the number of nitrogens from the
        number of hydrogens to arrive at the equivalent hydrocarbon formula. Again, you can convince yourself
        of this by seeing what happens when a nitrogen atom is inserted into an alkane bond: C-C becomes
        C-NH-C or C-H becomes C-NH2, meaning that one additional hydrogen atom has been added. We must
        therefore subtract this extra hydrogen atom to arrive at the equivalent hydrocarbon formula. For example,
        the formula C5H9N is equivalent to C5H8 and thus has two degrees of unsaturation.

     To summarize:

       · Add the number of halogens to the number of hydrogens.
       · Ignore the number of oxygens.
       · Subtract the number of nitrogens from the number of hydrogens.

7.3 Naming Alkenes

Alkenes are named using a series of rules similar to those for alkanes (Section 3.4), with the suffix -ene used
instead of -ane to identify the functional group. There are three steps to this process.
STEP 1
Name the parent hydrocarbon. Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, and name the
compound accordingly, using the suffix -ene:

STEP 2
Number the carbon atoms in the chain. Begin at the end nearer the double bond or, if the double bond is
equidistant from the two ends, begin at the end nearer the first branch point. This rule ensures that the double-
bond carbons receive the lowest possible numbers.

STEP 3
Write the full name. Number the substituents according to their positions in the chain, and list them
alphabetically. Indicate the position of the double bond by giving the number of the first alkene carbon and
placing that number directly before the parent name. If more than one double bond is present, indicate the
position of each and use one of the suffixes -diene, -triene, and so on.

We should also note that IUPAC changed their naming recommendations in 1993 to place the locant indicating
the position of the double bond immediately before the -ene suffix rather than before the parent name:
but-2-ene rather than 2-butene, for instance. This change has not been widely accepted by the chemical
community in the United States, however, so we'll stay with the older but more commonly used names. Be
aware, though, that you may occasionally encounter the newer system.
212  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     Cycloalkenes are named similarly, but because there is no chain end to begin from, we number the cycloalkene
     so that the double bond is between C1 and C2 and the first substituent has as low a number as possible. It's
     not necessary to indicate the position of the double bond in the name because it's always between C1 and C2.
     As with open-chain alkenes, the newer but not yet widely accepted naming rules place the locant immediately
     before the suffix in a cyclic alkene.

     For historical reasons, there are a few alkenes whose names are firmly entrenched in common usage but don't

     conform to the rules. For example, the alkene derived from ethane should be called ethene, but the name

     ethylene has been used for so long that it is accepted by IUPAC. TABLE 7.1 lists several other common names

     that are often used and are recognized by IUPAC. Note also that a =CH2 substituent is called a methylene group,

     a  substituent is called a vinyl group, and a                substituent is called an allyl group.

7.4 Cis-Trans Isomerism in Alkenes

We saw in the chapter on Structure and Bonding that the carbon-carbon double bond can be described in two
ways. In valence bond language (Section 1.8), the carbons are sp2-hybridized and have three equivalent hybrid
orbitals that lie in a plane at angles of 120° to one another. The carbons form a  bond by a head-on overlap of
sp2 orbitals and form a  bond by sideways overlap of unhybridized p orbitals oriented perpendicular to the sp2
plane, as shown in FIGURE 1.15.

In molecular orbital language (Section 1.11), interaction between the p orbitals leads to one bonding and one
antibonding  molecular orbital. The  bonding MO has no node between nuclei and results from a combination
of p orbital lobes with the same algebraic sign. The  antibonding MO has a node between nuclei and results
from a combination of lobes with different algebraic signs, as shown in FIGURE 1.19.

Although essentially free rotation around single bonds is possible (Section 3.6), the same is not true of double
bonds. For rotation to occur around a double bond, the  bond must break and re-form (FIGURE 7.3). Thus, the
barrier to double-bond rotation must be at least as great as the strength of the  bond itself, an estimated 350
kJ/mol (84 kcal/mol). Recall that the barrier to bond rotation in ethane is only 12 kJ/mol.

                       FIGURE 7.3 The  bond must break for rotation to take place around a carbon-carbon double bond.

The lack of rotation around carbon-carbon double bonds is of more than just theoretical interest; it also
has chemical consequences. Imagine the situation for a disubstituted alkene such as 2-butene. (Disubstituted
means that two substituents other than hydrogen are bonded to the double-bond carbons.) The two methyl
groups in 2-butene can either be on the same side of the double bond or on opposite sides, a situation similar to
that in disubstituted cycloalkanes (Section 4.2).

Since bond rotation can't occur, the two 2-butenes can't spontaneously interconvert; they are different, isolable
compounds. As with disubstituted cycloalkanes, we call such compounds cis-trans stereoisomers. The
compound with substituents on the same side of the double bond is called cis-2-butene, and the isomer with
substituents on opposite sides is trans-2-butene (FIGURE 7.4).
214  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     FIGURE 7.4 Cis and trans isomers of 2-butene. The cis isomer has the two methyl groups on the same side of the double bond, and the
     trans isomer has methyl groups on opposite sides.

     Cis-trans isomerism is not limited to disubstituted alkenes. It can occur whenever both double-bond carbons
     are attached to two different groups. If one of the double-bond carbons is attached to two identical groups,
     however, cis-trans isomerism is not possible (FIGURE 7.5).

     FIGURE 7.5 The requirement for cis-trans isomerism in alkenes. Compounds that have one of their carbons bonded to two identical
     groups can't exist as cis-trans isomers. Only when both carbons are bonded to two different groups is cis-trans isomerism possible.

     7.5 Alkene Stereochemistry and the E,Z Designation

     The cis-trans naming system used in the previous section works only with disubstituted alkenes--compounds
     that have two substituents other than hydrogen on the double bond. With trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted
     double bonds, a more general method is needed for describing double-bond geometry. (Trisubstituted means
     three substituents other than hydrogen on the double bond; tetrasubstituted means four substituents other
     than hydrogen.)
     The method used for describing alkene stereochemistry is called the E,Z system and employs the same
     Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rules given in Section 5.5 for specifying the configuration of a chirality center.
     Let's briefly review the sequence rules and then see how they're used to specify double-bond geometry. For a
     more thorough review, reread Section 5.5.

RULE 1
Considering each of the double-bond carbons separately, look at the two substituents attached and rank them
according to the atomic number of the first atom in each (8 for oxygen, 6 for carbon, 1 for hydrogen, and so
forth). An atom with higher atomic number ranks higher than an atom with lower atomic number.

RULE 2
If a decision can't be reached by ranking the first atoms in the two substituents, look at the second, third, or
fourth atoms away from the double-bond until the first difference is found.

RULE 3
Multiple-bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of single-bonded atoms.

Once the two groups attached to each double-bonded carbon have been ranked as either higher or lower, look
at the entire molecule. If the higher-ranked groups on each carbon are on the same side of the double bond, the
alkene is said to have a Z configuration, for the German zusammen, meaning "together." If the higher-ranked
groups are on opposite sides, the alkene has an E configuration, for the German entgegen, meaning "opposite."
(For a simple way to remember which is which, note that the groups are on "ze zame zide" in the Z isomer.)

As an example, look at the following two isomers of 2-chloro-2-butene. Because chlorine has a higher atomic
number than carbon, a -Cl substituent is ranked higher than a -CH3 group. Methyl is ranked higher than
hydrogen, however, so isomer (a) is designated E because the higher-ranked groups are on opposite sides of
the double bond. Isomer (b) has a Z configuration because its higher-ranked groups are on ze zame zide of the
double bond.

For further practice, work through each of the following examples to convince yourself that the assignments are
correct:

216  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     Strategy

     Look at the two substituents connected to each double-bonded carbon, and determine their ranking using the
     Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. Then, check whether the two higher-ranked groups are on the same or opposite
     sides of the double bond.

     Solution

     The left-hand carbon has -H and -CH3 substituents, of which -CH3 ranks higher by sequence rule 1. The right-
     hand carbon has -CH(CH3)2 and -CH2OH substituents, which are equivalent by rule 1. By rule 2, however,
     -CH2OH ranks higher than -CH(CH3)2 because the substituent -CH2OH has an oxygen as its highest second
     atom, but -CH(CH3)2 has a carbon as its highest second atom. The two higher-ranked groups are on the same

7.6 Stability of Alkenes

Although the cis-trans interconversion of alkene isomers does not occur spontaneously, it can often be made to
happen by treating the alkene with a strong acid catalyst. If we interconvert cis-2-butene with trans-2-butene
and allow them to reach equilibrium, we find that they aren't of equal stability. The trans isomer is more stable
than the cis isomer by 2.8 kJ/mol (0.66 kcal/mol) at room temperature, corresponding to a 76 : 24 ratio.

Cis alkenes are less stable than their trans isomers because of steric strain between the two larger substituents
on the same side of the double bond. This is the same kind of steric interference that we saw previously in the
axial conformation of methylcyclohexane (Section 4.7).

Although it's sometimes possible to find relative stabilities of alkene isomers by establishing a cis-trans
equilibrium through treatment with strong acid, a more general method is to take advantage of the fact that
alkenes undergo a hydrogenation reaction to give the corresponding alkane when treated with H2 gas in the
presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum.

Energy diagrams for the hydrogenation reactions of cis- and trans-2-butene are shown in FIGURE 7.6. Because
cis-2-butene is less stable than trans-2-butene by 2.8 kJ/mol, the energy diagram shows the cis alkene at a
higher energy level. After reaction, however, both curves are at the same energy level (butane). It therefore
follows that G° for reaction of the cis isomer must be larger than G° for reaction of the trans isomer by 2.8
kJ/mol. In other words, more energy is released in the hydrogenation of the cis isomer than the trans isomer
because the cis isomer has more energy to begin with.
218  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     FIGURE 7.6 Energy diagrams for hydrogenation of cis- and trans-2-butene. The cis isomer is higher in energy than the trans isomer by
     about 2.8 kJ/mol and therefore releases more energy when hydrogenated.

     If we were to measure the so-called heats of hydrogenation (H°hydrog) for two double-bond isomers and
     find their difference, we could determine the relative stabilities of cis and trans isomers without having to
     measure an equilibrium position. cis-2-Butene, for instance, has H°hydrog = -119 kJ/mol(-28.3 kcal/mol),
     while trans-2-butene has H°hydrog = -115 kJ/mol(-27.4 kcal/mol)--a difference of 4 kJ/mol.

     The 4 kJ/mol energy difference between the 2-butene isomers calculated from heats of hydrogenation agrees

     reasonably well with the 2.8 kJ/mol energy difference calculated from equilibrium data, but the values aren't

     exactly the same for two reasons. First, there is probably some experimental error, because heats of

     hydrogenation are difficult to measure accurately. Second, heats of reaction and equilibrium constants don't
     measure exactly the same thing. Heats of reaction measure enthalpy changes, H°, whereas equilibrium
     constants measure free-energy changes, G°, so we might expect a slight difference between the two.

The stability order of substituted alkenes is due to a combination of two factors. One is a stabilizing interaction

between the          orbital and adjacent C-H  bonds on substituents. In valence-bond language, the

interaction is called hyperconjugation. In a molecular orbital description, there is a bonding MO that extends

over the four-atom  grouping, as shown in FIGURE 7.7. The more substituents present on the double

bond, the more hyperconjugation occurs and the more stable the alkene.

FIGURE 7.7 Hyperconjugation is a stabilizing interaction between the   orbital and adjacent C-H  bonds on substituents. The

more substituents there are, the greater the stabilization of the alkene.

A second factor that contributes to alkene stability involves bond strengths. A bond between a sp2 carbon and
a sp3 carbon is somewhat stronger than a bond between two sp3 carbons. Thus, in comparing 1-butene and
2-butene, the monosubstituted isomer has one sp3-sp3 bond and one sp3-sp2 bond, while the disubstituted
isomer has two sp3-sp2 bonds. More highly substituted alkenes always have a higher ratio of sp3-sp2 bonds to
sp3-sp3 bonds than less highly substituted alkenes and are therefore more stable.

7.7 Electrophilic Addition Reactions of Alkenes

Before beginning a detailed discussion of alkene reactions, let's review briefly some conclusions from the

previous chapter. We said in Section 6.5 that alkenes behave as nucleophiles (Lewis bases) in polar reactions,

donating a pair of electrons from their electron-rich  bond to an electrophile (Lewis acid). For example,

reaction of 2-methylpropene with HBr yields 2-bromo-2-methylpropane. A careful study of this and similar

reactions by the British chemist Christopher Ingold and others in the 1930s led to the generally accepted

mechanism shown in FIGURE 7.8 for an electrophilic addition reaction.
220  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     FIGURE 7.8 MECHANISM

     Mechanism of the electrophilic addition of HBr to 2-methylpropene. The reaction
     occurs in two steps, protonation and bromide addition, and involves a carbocation
     intermediate.

     The reaction begins with an attack on the hydrogen of the electrophile HBr by the electrons of the nucleophilic
      bond. Two electrons from the  bond form a new  bond between the entering hydrogen and an alkene
     carbon, as shown by the curved arrow at the top of FIGURE 7.8. The resulting carbocation intermediate is itself
     an electrophile, which can accept an electron pair from nucleophilic Br- ion to form a C-Br bond and yield a
     neutral addition product.
     An energy diagram for the overall electrophilic addition reaction (FIGURE 7.9) has two peaks (transition states)
     separated by a valley (carbocation intermediate). The energy level of the intermediate is higher than that of the
     starting alkene, but the reaction as a whole is exergonic (negative G°). The first step, protonation of the alkene
     to yield the intermediate cation, is relatively slow. But once the cation intermediate is formed, it rapidly reacts
     to yield the final alkyl bromide product. The relative rates of the two steps are indicated in FIGURE 7.9 by the
     fact that G1 is larger than G2.

FIGURE 7.9 Energy diagram for the two-step electrophilic addition of HBr to 2-methylpropene. The first step is slower than the second

Electrophilic addition to alkenes is successful not only with HBr but with HCl, HI, and H2O as well. Note that HI
is usually generated in the reaction mixture by treating potassium iodide with phosphoric acid and that a strong
acid catalyst is needed for the addition of water.

  WRITING ORGANIC REACTIONS

  This is a good place to mention that the equations for organic reactions are sometimes written in different
  ways to emphasize different points. In describing a laboratory process, for instance, the reaction of
  2-methylpropene with HCl might be written in the format A + B  C to emphasize that both reactants are
  equally important for the purposes of the discussion. The solvent and notes about other reaction conditions
  such as temperature are written either above or below the reaction arrow.
222  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     Alternatively, we might write the same reaction in a format to emphasize that 2-methylpropene is the
     reactant whose chemistry is of greater interest. The second reactant, HCl, is placed above the reaction arrow
     together with notes about solvent and reaction conditions.

     In describing a biological process, the reaction is almost always written to show only the structures of the
     primary reactant and product, while abbreviating the structures of various biological "reagents" and by-
     products with a curved arrow that intersects the straight reaction arrow. As discussed in Section 6.11, the
     reaction of glucose with ATP to give glucose 6-phosphate plus ADP would then be written as

     7.8 Orientation of Electrophilic Additions: Markovnikov's Rule

     Look carefully at the electrophilic addition reactions shown in the previous section. In each case, an
     unsymmetrically substituted alkene has given a single addition product rather than the mixture that might
     be expected. For example, 2-methylpropene might react with HCl to give both 2-chloro-2-methylpropane and
     1-chloro-2-methylpropane, but it doesn't. It gives only 2-chloro-2-methylpropane as the sole product. Similarly,
     it's invariably the case in biological alkene addition reactions that only a single product is formed. We say that
     such reactions are regiospecific (ree-jee-oh-specific) when only one of two possible orientations of an addition
     occurs.

     After looking at the results of many such reactions, the Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov proposed in
     1869 what has become known as:

           Markovnikov's rule
           In the addition of HX to an alkene, the H attaches to the carbon with fewer alkyl substituents and the X
           attaches to the carbon with more alkyl substituents.

When both double-bonded carbon atoms have the same degree of substitution, a mixture of addition products
results.

Because carbocations are involved as intermediates in these electrophilic addition reactions, Markovnikov's
rule can be restated in the following way:

      Markovnikov's rule restated
      In the addition of HX to an alkene, the more highly substituted carbocation is formed as the
      intermediate rather than the less highly substituted one.
For example, addition of H+ to 2-methylpropene yields the intermediate tertiary carbocation rather than the
alternative primary carbocation, and addition to 1-methylcyclohexene yields a tertiary cation rather than a
secondary one. Why should this be?

     7.9 Carbocation Structure and Stability

     To understand why Markovnikov's rule works, we need to learn more about the structure and stability of
     carbocations and about the general nature of reactions and transition states. The first point to explore involves
     structure.

     A great deal of experimental evidence has shown that carbocations are planar. The trivalent carbon is
     sp2-hybridized, and the three substituents are oriented toward the corners of an equilateral triangle, as
     indicated in FIGURE 7.10. Because there are only six valence electrons on carbon and all six are used in the
     three  bonds, the p orbital extending above and below the plane is unoccupied.

     FIGURE 7.10 The structure of a carbocation. The trivalent carbon is sp2-hybridized and has a vacant p orbital perpendicular to the plane of
     the carbon and three attached groups.

     The second point to explore involves carbocation stability. 2-Methylpropene might react with H+ to form a
     carbocation having three alkyl substituents (a tertiary ion, 3°), or it might react to form a carbocation having
     one alkyl substituent (a primary ion, 1°). Since the tertiary alkyl chloride, 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, is the only
     product observed, formation of the tertiary cation is evidently favored over formation of the primary cation.
     Thermodynamic measurements show that, indeed, the stability of carbocations increases with increasing
     substitution so that the stability order is tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl.

     One way of determining carbocation stabilities is to measure the amount of energy required to form a
     carbocation by dissociation of the corresponding alkyl halide, R - X  R+ + :X-. As shown in FIGURE 7.11,
     tertiary alkyl halides dissociate to give carbocations more easily than secondary or primary ones. Thus,
     trisubstituted carbocations are more stable than disubstituted ones, which are more stable than
     monosubstituted ones. The data in FIGURE 7.11 are taken from measurements made in the gas phase, but
     a similar stability order is found for carbocations in solution. The dissociation enthalpies are much lower in
     solution because polar solvents can stabilize the ions, but the order of carbocation stability remains the same.

FIGURE 7.11 A plot of dissociation enthalpy versus substitution pattern for the gas-phase dissociation of alkyl chlorides to yield
carbocations. More highly substituted alkyl halides dissociate more easily than less highly substituted ones.

Why are more highly substituted carbocations more stable than less highly substituted ones? There are at least
two reasons. Part of the answer has to do with inductive effects, and part has to do with hyperconjugation.
Inductive effects, discussed in Section 2.1 in connection with polar covalent bonds, result from the shifting of
electrons in a  bond in response to the electronegativity of nearby atoms. In the present instance, electrons
from a relatively larger and more polarizable alkyl group can shift toward a neighboring positive charge more
easily than the electron from a hydrogen. Thus, the more alkyl groups attached to the positively charged carbon,
the more electron density shifts toward the charge and the more inductive stabilization of the cation occurs
(FIGURE 7.12).

FIGURE 7.12 A comparison of inductive stabilization for methyl, primary, secondary, and tertiary carbocations. The more alkyl groups
that are bonded to the positively charged carbon, the more electron density shifts toward the charge, making the charged carbon less
electron-poor (blue in electrostatic potential maps).

Hyperconjugation, discussed in Section 7.6 in connection with the stabilities of substituted alkenes, is the
stabilizing interaction between a p orbital and properly oriented C-H  bonds on neighboring carbons that are
roughly parallel to the p orbital. The more alkyl groups there are on the carbocation, the more possibilities there
are for hyperconjugation and the more stable the carbocation. FIGURE 7.13 shows the molecular orbital for the
ethyl carbocation, CH3CH2+, and indicates the difference between the C-H bond perpendicular to the cation p
orbital and the two C-H bonds more parallel to the cation p orbital. Only these roughly parallel C-H bonds are
oriented properly to take part in hyperconjugation.

     7.10 The Hammond Postulate

     Let's summarize what we've learned of electrophilic addition reactions to this point:

       · Electrophilic addition to an unsymmetrically substituted alkene gives the more substituted
           carbocation intermediate. A more substituted carbocation forms faster than a less substituted one and,
           once formed, rapidly goes on to give the final product.

       · A more substituted carbocation is more stable than a less substituted one. That is, the stability order of
           carbocations is tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl.

     What we have not yet seen is how these two points are related. Why does the stability of the carbocation
     intermediate affect the rate at which it's formed and thereby determine the structure of the final product? After
     all, carbocation stability is determined by the free-energy change G°, but reaction rate is determined by the
     activation energy G. The two quantities aren't directly related.

     Although there is no simple quantitative relationship between the stability of a carbocation intermediate and
     the rate of its formation, there is an intuitive relationship. It's generally true when comparing two similar
     reactions that the more stable intermediate forms faster than the less stable one. The situation is shown
     graphically in FIGURE 7.14, where the energy profile in part (a) represents the typical situation, as opposed to
     the profile in part (b). That is, the curves for two similar reactions don't cross one another.

FIGURE 7.14 Energy diagrams for two similar competing reactions. In (a), the faster reaction yields the more stable intermediate. In (b),
the slower reaction yields the more stable intermediate. The curves shown in (a) represent the typical situation.

Called the Hammond postulate, the explanation of the relationship between reaction rate and intermediate
stability goes like this: Transition states represent energy maxima. They are high-energy activated complexes
that occur transiently during the course of a reaction and immediately go on to a more stable species. Although
we can't actually observe transition states because they have no finite lifetime, the Hammond postulate says
that we can get an idea of a particular transition state's structure by looking at the structure of the nearest stable
species. Imagine the two cases shown in FIGURE 7.15, for example. The reaction profile in part (a) shows the
energy curve for an endergonic reaction step, and the profile in part (b) shows the curve for an exergonic step.

FIGURE 7.15 Energy diagrams for endergonic and exergonic steps. (a) In an endergonic step, the energy levels of transition state and
product are closer. (b) In an exergonic step, the energy levels of transition state and reactant are closer.

In an endergonic reaction (FIGURE 7.15a), the energy level of the transition state is closer to that of the product
than that of the reactant. Since the transition state is closer energetically to the product, we make the natural
assumption that it's also closer structurally. In other words, the transition state for an endergonic reaction
step structurally resembles the product of that step. Conversely, the transition state for an exergonic reaction
(FIGURE 7.15b), is closer energetically, and thus structurally, to the reactant than to the product. We therefore
say that the transition state for an exergonic reaction step structurally resembles the reactant for that step.

      Hammond postulate:
      The structure of a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stable species. Transition
      states for endergonic steps structurally resemble products, and transition states for exergonic steps
      structurally resemble reactants.
How does the Hammond postulate apply to electrophilic addition reactions? The formation of a carbocation by
protonation of an alkene is an endergonic step. Thus, the transition state for alkene protonation structurally
resembles the carbocation intermediate, and any factor that stabilizes the carbocation will also stabilize the
nearby transition state. Since increasing alkyl substitution stabilizes carbocations, it also stabilizes the
transition states leading to those ions, thus resulting in a faster reaction. In other words, more stable
carbocations form faster because their greater stability is reflected in the lower-energy transition state leading
to them (FIGURE 7.16).
230  7 · Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity

     FIGURE 7.16 Energy diagrams for carbocation formation. The more stable tertiary carbocation is formed faster (green curve) because its
     increased stability lowers the energy of the transition state leading to it.

     We can imagine the transition state for alkene protonation to be a structure in which one of the alkene carbon
     atoms has almost completely rehybridized from sp2 to sp3 and the remaining alkene carbon bears much of
     the positive charge (FIGURE 7.17). This transition state is stabilized by hyperconjugation and inductive effects
     in the same way as the product carbocation. The more alkyl groups that are present, the greater the extent of
     stabilization and the faster the transition state forms.

     FIGURE 7.17 The hypothetical structure of a transition state for alkene protonation. The transition state is closer in both energy and
     structure to the carbocation than to the alkene. Thus, an increase in carbocation stability (lower G°) also causes an increase in transition-
     state stability (lower G), thereby increasing the rate of its formation.

     PROBLEM       What about the second step in the electrophilic addition of HCl to an alkene--the reaction of
             7-20  chloride ion with the carbocation intermediate? Is this step exergonic or endergonic? Does the
                   transition state for this second step resemble the reactant (carbocation) or product (alkyl chloride)?
                   Make a rough drawing of what the transition-state structure might look like.

     7.11 Evidence for the Mechanism of Electrophilic Additions: Carbocation
     Rearrangements

     How do we know that the carbocation mechanism for electrophilic addition reactions of alkenes is correct? The
     answer is that we don't know it's correct; at least we don't know with complete certainty. Although an incorrect
     reaction mechanism can be disproved by demonstrating that it doesn't account for observed data, a correct
     reaction mechanism can never be entirely proven. The best we can do is to show that a proposed mechanism is
     consistent with all known facts. If enough facts are accounted for, the mechanism is probably correct.

     One of the best pieces of evidence supporting the carbocation mechanism for the electrophilic addition reaction
     was discovered during the 1930s by F. C. Whitmore of Pennsylvania State University, who found that structural
     rearrangements often occur during the reaction of HX with an alkene. For example, reaction of HCl with
     3-methyl-1-butene yields a substantial amount of 2-chloro-2-methylbutane in addition to the "expected"
     product, 2-chloro-3-methylbutane.

If the reaction takes place in a single step, it would be difficult to account for rearrangement, but if the
reaction takes place in several steps, rearrangement is more easily explained. Whitmore suggested that it is a
carbocation intermediate that undergoes rearrangement. The secondary carbocation intermediate formed by
protonation of 3-methyl-1-butene rearranges to a more stable tertiary carbocation by a hydride shift--the shift
of a hydrogen atom and its electron pair (a hydride ion, :H-) between neighboring carbons.

Carbocation rearrangements can also occur by the shift of an alkyl group with its electron pair. For example,
reaction of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene with HCl leads to an equal mixture of unrearranged
3-chloro-2,2-dimethylbutane and rearranged 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane. In this instance, a secondary
carbocation rearranges to a more stable tertiary carbocation by the shift of a methyl group.

Note the similarities between the two carbocation rearrangements: in both cases, a group (:H- or :CH3-) moves
to an adjacent positively charged carbon, taking its bonding electron pair with it. Also in both cases, a less stable
carbocation rearranges to a more stable ion. Rearrangements of this kind are a common feature of carbocation
chemistry and are particularly important in the biological pathways by which steroids and related substances
are synthesized. An example is the following hydride shift that occurs during the biosynthesis of cholesterol.

     As always, when looking at any complex chemical transformation, whether biochemical or not, focus on the
     part of the molecule where the change is occurring and don't worry about the rest. The tertiary carbocation just
     pictured looks complicated, but all the chemistry is taking place in the small part of the molecule inside the red

Bioprospecting: Hunting for Natural Products

Most people know the names of the common classes of biomolecules--proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and
nucleic acids--but there are many more kinds of compounds in living organisms than just those four. All living
organisms also contain a vast diversity of substances usually grouped under the heading natural products.
The term natural product really refers to any naturally occurring substance but is generally taken to mean a
so-called secondary metabolite--a small molecule that is not essential to the growth and development of the
producing organism and is not classified by structure.

FIGURE 7.18 Rapamycin, an immunosuppressant natural product used during organ transplants, was originally isolated from a soil sample
found on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), an island 2200 miles off the coast of Chile known for its giant Moai statues. (credit: modification of work
"Moai facing inland at Ahu Tongariki" by Ian Sewell/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.5)

It has been estimated that well over 300,000 secondary metabolites exist, and it's thought that their primary
function is to increase the likelihood of an organism's survival by repelling or attracting other organisms.
Alkaloids, such as morphine; antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the penicillins; and immunosuppressive
agents, such as rapamycin (sirolimus) prescribed for liver transplant recipients, are examples.

Where do these natural products come from, and how are they found? Although most chemists and biologists
spend their working time in the laboratory, a few spend their days scuba diving on South Pacific islands or
trekking through the rainforests of South America and Southeast Asia at work as bioprospectors. Their job is to
234 7 · Key Terms

hunt for new and unusual natural products that might be useful as drugs.

As noted in the Chapter 6 Chemistry Matters, more than half of all new drug candidates come either directly
or indirectly from natural products. Morphine from the opium poppy, prostaglandin E1 from sheep prostate
glands, erythromycin A from a Streptomyces erythreus bacterium cultured from a Philippine soil sample, and
benzylpenicillin from the mold Penicillium notatum are examples. The immunosuppressive agent rapamycin,
whose structure is shown previously, was first isolated from a Streptomyces hygroscopicus bacterium found in
a soil sample from Rapa Nui (Easter Island), located 2200 miles off the coast of Chile.

With less than 1% of living organisms yet investigated, bioprospectors have a lot of work to do. But there is a
race going on. Rainforests throughout the world are being destroyed at an alarming rate, causing many species
of both plants and animals to become extinct before they can even be examined. The governments in many
countries seem aware of the problem, but there is as yet no international treaty on biodiversity that could help
preserve vanishing species.

Summary

Carbon-carbon double bonds are present in most organic and biological molecules, so a good understanding of
their behavior is needed. In this chapter, we've looked at some consequences of alkene stereoisomerism and at
the details of the broadest class of alkene reactions--the electrophilic addition reaction.

An alkene is a hydrocarbon that contains a carbon-carbon double bond. Because they contain fewer hydrogens
than alkanes with the same number of carbons, alkenes are said to be unsaturated.

Because rotation around the double bond can't occur, substituted alkenes can exist as cis-trans stereoisomers.
The configuration of a double bond can be specified by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rules, which
rank the substituents on each double-bond carbon. If the higher-ranking groups on each carbon are on the
same side of the double bond, the configuration is Z (zusammen, "together"); if the higher-ranking groups on
each carbon are on opposite sides of the double bond, the configuration is E (entgegen, "apart").

Alkene chemistry is dominated by electrophilic addition reactions. When HX reacts with an unsymmetrically
substituted alkene, Markovnikov's rule predicts that the H will add to the carbon having fewer alkyl
substituents and the X group will add to the carbon having more alkyl substituents. Electrophilic additions to
alkenes take place through carbocation intermediates formed by reaction of the nucleophilic alkene  bond
with electrophilic H+. Carbocation stability follows the order

Tertiary (3°) > Secondary (2°) > Primary (1°) > Methyl
R3C+ > R2CH+ > RCH2+ > CH3+

Markovnikov's rule can be restated by saying that, in the addition of HX to an alkene, a more stable carbocation
intermediate is formed. This result is explained by the Hammond postulate, which says that the transition state
of an exergonic reaction step structurally resembles the reactant, whereas the transition state of an endergonic
reaction step structurally resembles the product. Since an alkene protonation step is endergonic, the stability
of the more highly substituted carbocation is reflected in the stability of the transition state leading to its
formation.

Evidence in support of a carbocation mechanism for electrophilic additions comes from the observation that

structural rearrangements often take place during reaction. Rearrangements occur by shift of either a hydride
ion, :H- (a hydride shift), or an alkyl anion, :R-, from a carbon atom to the neighboring positively charged

carbon. This results in isomerization of a less stable carbocation to a more stable one.

     8.1 Preparing Alkenes: A Preview of Elimination Reactions

     Before getting to the main subject of this chapter--the reactions of alkenes--let's take a brief look at how alkenes
     are prepared. The subject is a bit complex, though, so we'll return to it in Chapter 11 for a more detailed
     study. For the present, it's enough to realize that alkenes are readily available from simple precursors--usually
     alcohols in biological systems and either alcohols or alkyl halides in the laboratory.
     Just as the chemistry of alkenes is dominated by addition reactions, the preparation of alkenes is dominated
     by elimination reactions. Additions and eliminations are, in many respects, two sides of the same coin. That is,
     an addition reaction might involve the addition of HBr or H2O to an alkene to form an alkyl halide or alcohol,
     whereas an elimination reaction might involve the loss of HBr or H2O from an alkyl halide or alcohol to form an
     alkene.

     The two most common elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation--the loss of HX from an alkyl halide--and
     dehydration--the loss of water from an alcohol. Dehydrohalogenation usually occurs by reaction of an alkyl
     halide with strong base such as potassium hydroxide. For example, bromocyclohexane yields cyclohexene when
     treated with KOH in ethanol solution.

     Dehydration is often carried out in the laboratory by treatment of an alcohol with a strong acid. For example,
     when 1-methylcyclohexanol is warmed with aqueous sulfuric acid in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent, loss of

water occurs and 1-methylcyclohexene is formed.

In biological pathways, dehydrations rarely occur with isolated alcohols. Instead, they normally take place

on substrates in which the -OH is positioned two carbons away from a  group. In the biosynthesis of

fats, for instance, -hydroxybutyryl ACP is converted by dehydration to trans-crotonyl ACP, where ACP is an

abbreviation for acyl carrier protein. We'll see the reason for this requirement in Section 11.10.

PROBLEM One problem with elimination reactions is that mixtures of products are often formed. For example,
          8-1 treatment of 2-bromo-2-methylbutane with KOH in ethanol yields a mixture of two alkene products.
                 What are their likely structures?

PROBLEM How many alkene products, including E,Z isomers, might be obtained by dehydration of
          8-2 3-methyl-3-hexanol with aqueous sulfuric acid?

8.2 Halogenation of Alkenes: Addition of X2

Bromine and chlorine add rapidly to alkenes to yield 1,2-dihalides, a process called halogenation. For example,
nearly 50 million tons of 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride) are synthesized worldwide each year, much
of it by addition of Cl2 to ethylene. The product is used both as a solvent and as starting material for the
manufacture of poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, the third most widely synthesized polymer in the world
afterpolyethelyne and polypropolyne. Fluorine is too reactive and difficult to control for most laboratory
applications, and iodine does not react with most alkenes.

Based on what we've seen thus far, a possible mechanism for the reaction of bromine with alkenes might involve
electrophilic addition of Br+ to the alkene, giving a carbocation intermediate that could undergo further reaction
with Br- to yield the dibromo addition product.
246  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     Although this mechanism seems plausible, it's not fully consistent with known facts. In particular, it doesn't
     explain the stereochemistry of the addition reaction. That is, the mechanism doesn't account for which product
     stereoisomer is formed.

     When the halogenation reaction is carried out on a cycloalkene, such as cyclopentene, only the trans
     stereoisomer of the dihalide addition product is formed, rather than the mixture of cis and trans isomers
     that might have been expected if a planar carbocation intermediate were involved. We say that the reaction
     occurs with anti stereochemistry, meaning that the two bromine atoms come from opposite faces of the double
     bond--one from the top face and one from the bottom face.

     An explanation for the observed stereochemistry of addition was suggested in 1937 by George Kimball and

     Irving Roberts, who proposed that the reaction intermediate is not a carbocation but is instead a bromonium

     ion,  , formed by electrophilic addition of Br+ to the alkene. (Similarly, a chloronium ion contains a

     positively charged, divalent chlorine, R2Cl+.) The bromonium ion is formed in a single step by interaction of the
     alkene with Br2 and the simultaneous loss of Br-.

     How does the formation of a bromonium ion account for the observed anti stereochemistry of addition to

     cyclopentene? If a bromonium ion is formed as an intermediate, we can imagine that the large bromine atom
     might "shield" one side of the molecule. Reaction with Br- ion in the second step could then occur only from the

     opposite, unshielded side to give the trans product.

The bromonium ion postulate, made more than 85 years ago to explain the stereochemistry of halogen addition
to alkenes, is a remarkable example of deductive logic in chemistry. Arguing from experimental results,
chemists were able to make a hypothesis about the intimate mechanistic details of alkene electrophilic
reactions. Subsequently, strong evidence supporting the mechanism came from the work of George Olah at the
University of Southern California, who prepared and studied stable solutions of cyclic bromonium ions in liquid
SO2. There's no question that bromonium ions exist.

Alkene halogenation reactions occur in nature just as they do in the laboratory but are limited primarily to
marine organisms living in halide-rich environments. These biological halogenation reactions are carried out
by enzymes called haloperoxidases, which use H2O2 to oxidize Br- or Cl- ions to a biological equivalent of Br+ or
Cl+. Electrophilic addition to the double bond of a substrate molecule then yields a bromonium or chloronium
ion intermediate just as in the laboratory, and reaction with another halide ion completes the process. Halomon,
for example, an antitumor pentahalide isolated from red alga, is thought to arise by a route that involves twofold
addition of BrCl through the corresponding bromonium ions.

8.3 Halohydrins from Alkenes: Addition of HO-X

Another example of an electrophilic addition is the reaction an alkene with either Br2 or Cl2 in the presence of
248  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     water to yield a 1,2-halo alcohol, called a halohydrin.

     We saw in the previous section that when Br2 reacts with an alkene, the cyclic bromonium ion intermediate
     reacts with the only nucleophile present, Br- ion. If the reaction is carried out in the presence of an additional
     nucleophile, however, the intermediate bromonium ion can be intercepted by the added nucleophile and
     diverted to a different product. In the presence of a high concentration of water, for instance, water competes
     with Br- ion as a nucleophile and reacts with the bromonium ion intermediate to yield a bromohydrin. The net
     effect is addition of HO-Br to the alkene by the pathway shown in FIGURE 8.3.

                         FIGURE 8.3 MECHANISM

                          Bromohydrin formation by reaction of an alkene with Br2 in the presence of water.
                          Water acts as a nucleophile in step 2 to react with the intermediate bromonium ion.

     In practice, few alkenes are soluble in water, and bromohydrin formation is often carried out in a solvent such as
     aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide, CH3SOCH3 (DMSO), using a reagent called N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as a source
     of Br2. NBS is a stable, easily handled compound that slowly decomposes in water to yield Br2 at a controlled
     rate. Bromine itself can also be used in the addition reaction, but it is more dangerous and more difficult to
     handle than NBS.

Notice that the aromatic ring in the above example does not react with Br2, even though it appears to have three
carbon-carbon double bonds. As we'll see in Section 15.2, aromatic rings are a good deal more stable and less
reactive than might be expected.
There are a number of biological examples of halohydrin formation, particularly in marine organisms. As with
halogenation (Section 8.2), halohydrin formation is carried out by haloperoxidases. For example:

PROBLEM What product would you expect from the reaction of cyclopentene with NBS and water? Show the

PROBLEM When an unsymmetrical alkene such as propene is treated with N-bromosuccinimide in aqueous

8.4 Hydration of Alkenes: Addition of H2O by Oxymercuration

Water adds to alkenes to yield alcohols, a process called hydration. The reaction takes place on treatment of the
alkene with water and a strong acid catalyst, such as H2SO4, by a mechanism similar to that of HX addition.
Thus, as shown in FIGURE 8.4, protonation of an alkene double bond yields a carbocation intermediate, which
reacts with water to yield a protonated alcohol product, ROH2+. Loss of H+ from this protonated alcohol gives
the neutral alcohol and regenerates the acid catalyst.
250  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     FIGURE 8.4 MECHANISM

     Mechanism of the acid-catalyzed hydration of an alkene to yield an alcohol.
     Protonation of the alkene gives a carbocation intermediate, which reacts with water.
     The initial product is then deprotonated.

     Most ethanol throughout the world is now made by fermentation of biological precursors, such as corn and
     sugar, but acid-catalyzed alkene hydration is particularly suited to large-scale industrial procedures, and
     approximately 90,000 tons of ethanol is manufactured each year in the United States by hydration of ethylene.
     The reaction is of little value in the laboratory, however, because it requires high temperatures--250 °C in the
     case of ethylene--and strongly acidic conditions.

     Acid-catalyzed hydration of double bonds is also uncommon in biological pathways. Instead, biological

hydrations usually require that the double bond be adjacent to a carbonyl group for reaction to proceed.
Fumarate, for instance, is hydrated to give malate as one step in the citric acid cycle of food metabolism. Note
that the requirement for an adjacent carbonyl group in the addition of water is the same as in Section 8.1 for the
elimination of water. We'll see the reason for this requirement in Section 19.13, but will note for now that the
reaction is not an electrophilic addition but instead occurs through a mechanism that involves formation of an
anion intermediate followed by protonation by an acid HA.

When it comes to circumventing problems like those with acid-catalyzed alkene hydrations, laboratory
chemists have a great advantage over the cellular "chemists" in living organisms. Laboratory chemists are
not constrained to carry out their reactions in water solution; they can choose from any of a large number of
solvents. Laboratory reactions don't need to be carried out at a fixed temperature; they can take place over a
wide range of temperatures. And laboratory reagents aren't limited to containing carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and
a few other elements; they can contain any element in the periodic table.

In the laboratory, alkenes are often hydrated by the oxymercuration-demercuration procedure, which
involves electrophilic addition of Hg2+ to the alkene on reaction with mercury(II) acetate [(CH3CO2)2Hg. The
intermediate organomercury compound is then treated with sodium borohydride, NaBH4, and demercuration
occurs to produce an alcohol. For example:

Alkene oxymercuration is closely analogous to halohydrin formation. The reaction is initiated by electrophilic
addition of Hg2+ (mercuric) ion to the alkene to give an intermediate mercurinium ion, whose structure
resembles that of a bromonium ion (FIGURE 8.5). Nucleophilic addition of water as in halohydrin formation,
followed by the loss of a proton, then yields a stable organomercury product. The final step, demercuration of
the organomercury compound by reaction with sodium borohydride, is complex and involves radicals. Note
that the regiochemistry of the reaction corresponds to Markovnikov addition of water; that is, the -OH group
attaches to the more highly substituted carbon atom, and the -H attaches to the less highly substituted carbon.
The hydrogen that replaces mercury in the demercuration step can attach from either side of the molecule
depending on the exact circumstances.

FIGURE 8.5 Mechanism of the oxymercuration of an alkene to yield an alcohol. (1) Electrophilic addition of Hg2+ gives a mercurinium

ion, which (2) reacts with water as in halohydrin formation. Loss of a proton gives an organomercury product, and (3) reaction with NaBH4
removes the mercury. The product of the reaction is a more highly substituted alcohol, corresponding to Markovnikov regiochemistry.

     8.5 Hydration of Alkenes: Addition of H2O by Hydroboration

     In addition to the oxymercuration-demercuration method, which yields the Markovnikov product, a
     complementary method that yields the non-Markovnikov product is also useful. Discovered in 1959 by H.C.
     Brown at Purdue University and called hydroboration, the reaction involves addition of a B-H bond of borane,
     BH3, to an alkene to yield an organoborane intermediate, RBH2. Oxidation of the organoborane by reaction with
     basic hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, then gives an alcohol. For example:

     Borane is very reactive as a Lewis acid because the boron atom has only six electrons in its valence shell rather
     than an octet. In tetrahydrofuran solution, BH3 accepts an electron pair from a solvent molecule in a Lewis
     acid-base reaction to complete its octet and form a stable BH3-THF complex.

     When an alkene reacts with BH3 in THF solution, rapid addition to the double bond occurs three times and
     a trialkylborane, R3B, is formed. For example, 1 molar equivalent of BH3 adds to 3 molar equivalents of
     cyclohexene to yield tricyclohexylborane. When tricyclohexylborane is then treated with aqueous hydrogen

     H2O2 in basic solution, an oxidation takes place. The three C-B bonds are broken, -OH groups bond to the
     three carbons, and 3 equivalents of cyclohexanol are produced. The net effect of the two-step

     hydroboration-oxidation sequence is hydration of the alkene double bond.

     One of the features that makes the hydroboration reaction so useful is the regiochemistry that results when an
     unsymmetrical alkene is hydroborated. For example, hydroboration-oxidation of 1-methylcyclopentene yields
     trans-2-methylcyclopentanol. In this process, boron and hydrogen add to the alkene from the same face of the
     double bond--that is, with syn stereochemistry, the opposite of anti--with boron attaching to the less highly
     substituted carbon. During the oxidation step, the boron is replaced by an -OH with the same stereochemistry,
     resulting in an overall syn non-Markovnikov addition of water. This stereochemical result is particularly useful
     because it is complementary to the Markovnikov regiochemistry observed for oxymercuration-demercuration.

Why does alkene hydroboration take place with syn, non-Markovnikov regiochemistry to yield the less highly
substituted alcohol? Hydroboration differs from many other alkene addition reactions in that it occurs in a
single step without a carbocation intermediate (FIGURE 8.6). Because the C-H and C-B bonds form at the
same time and from the same face of the alkene, syn stereochemistry results. Non-Markovnikov regiochemistry
occurs because attachment of boron is favored at the less sterically crowded carbon atom of the alkene.

FIGURE 8.6 Mechanism of alkene hydroboration. The reaction occurs in a single step in which the C-H and C-B bonds form at the same
time and on the same face of the double bond. The lower energy, more rapidly formed transition state is the one with less steric crowding,
leading to non-Markovnikov regiochemistry.

recall that the two methods of hydration--hydroboration-oxidation and oxymercuration-demercuration--give

     Problems that require the synthesis of a specific target molecule should always be worked backward. Look at

     alcohols can be prepared from alkenes by either hydroboration-oxidation or oxymercuration-demercuration.

     4-Methyl-2-hexene has a disubstituted double bond,  , and will probably give a mixture of two

8.6 Reduction of Alkenes: Hydrogenation

Alkenes react with H2 in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum to yield the
corresponding saturated alkanes. We describe the result by saying that the double bond has been
hydrogenated, or reduced. Note that the word reduction is used somewhat differently in organic chemistry
from what you might have learned previously. In general chemistry, a reduction is defined as the gain of one
or more electrons by an atom. In organic chemistry, however, a reduction is a reaction that results in a gain
of electron density for carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a less electronegative
atom--usually hydrogen--or by bond-breaking between carbon and a more electronegative atom--usually
oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen. We'll explore this topic in more detail in Section 10.8.

Platinum and palladium are the most common laboratory catalysts for alkene hydrogenations. Palladium is
normally used as a very fine powder "supported" on an inert material such as charcoal (Pd/C) to maximize
surface area. Platinum is normally used as PtO2, a reagent known as Adams' catalyst after its discoverer, Roger
Adams at the University of Illinois.
Catalytic hydrogenation, unlike most other organic reactions, is a heterogeneous process rather than a
homogeneous one. That is, the hydrogenation reaction does not occur in a homogeneous solution but instead
takes place on the surface of solid catalyst particles. Hydrogenation usually occurs with syn stereochemistry:
both hydrogens add to the double bond from the same face.

As shown in FIGURE 8.7, hydrogenation begins with adsorption of H2 onto the catalyst surface. Complexation
between catalyst and alkene then occurs as a vacant orbital on the metal interacts with the filled alkene  orbital
256  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     on the alkene. In the final steps, hydrogen is inserted into the double bond and the saturated product diffuses
     away from the catalyst. The stereochemistry of hydrogenation is syn because both hydrogens add to the double
     bond from the same catalyst surface.

                           FIGURE 8.7 MECHANISM

                           Mechanism of alkene hydrogenation. The reaction takes place with syn
                           stereochemistry on the surface of insoluble catalyst particles.

     An interesting feature of catalytic hydrogenation is that the reaction is extremely sensitive to the steric
     environment around the double bond. As a result, the catalyst usually approaches the more accessible face of an
     alkene, giving rise to a single product. In -pinene, for example, one of the methyl groups attached to the four-
     membered ring hangs over the top face of the double bond and blocks approach of the hydrogenation catalyst
     from that side. Reduction therefore occurs exclusively from the bottom face to yield the product shown.

Alkenes are much more reactive toward catalytic hydrogenation than most other unsaturated functional
groups, and the reaction is therefore quite selective. Other functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones,
esters, and nitriles, often survive alkene hydrogenation conditions unchanged, although reaction with these
groups does occur under more vigorous conditions. Note that, particularly in the hydrogenation of methyl
3-phenylpropenoate shown below, the aromatic ring is not reduced by hydrogen and palladium even though it
contains apparent double bonds.

In addition to its usefulness in the laboratory, catalytic hydrogenation is also important in the food industry,
where unsaturated vegetable oils are reduced on a large scale to produce the saturated fats used in margarine
and cooking products (FIGURE 8.8). As we'll see in Section 27.1, vegetable oils are triesters of glycerol,
HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH, with three long-chain carboxylic acids called fatty acids. The fatty acids are generally
polyunsaturated, and their double bonds have cis stereochemistry. Complete hydrogenation yields the
corresponding saturated fatty acids, but incomplete hydrogenation often results in partial cis-trans
isomerization of a remaining double bond. When eaten and digested, the free trans fatty acids are released,
raising blood cholesterol levels and potentially contributing to coronary problems.
258  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     FIGURE 8.8 Catalytic hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats leads primarily to saturated products, along with a small amount of
     isomerized trans fats.

     Double-bond reductions are very common in biological pathways, although the mechanism is completely
     different from that of laboratory catalytic hydrogenation over palladium. As with biological hydrations (Section
     8.4), biological reductions usually occur in two steps and require that the double bond be adjacent to a carbonyl
     group. In the first step, the biological reducing agent NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
     phosphate), adds a hydride ion (H:-) to the double bond to give an anion. In the second, the anion is protonated
     by acid HA, leading to overall addition of H2. An example is the reduction of trans-crotonyl ACP to yield butyryl
     ACP, a step involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (FIGURE 8.9).

     FIGURE 8.9 Reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond in trans-crotonyl ACP, a step in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. One hydrogen

8.7 Oxidation of Alkenes: Epoxidation and Hydroxylation

Like the word reduction used in the previous section for the addition of hydrogen to a double bond, the word
oxidation has a slightly different meaning in organic chemistry than what you might have previously learned. In
general chemistry, an oxidation is defined as the loss of one or more electrons by an atom. In organic chemistry,
however, an oxidation is a reaction that results in a loss of electron density for carbon, caused either by bond
formation between carbon and a more electronegative atom--usually oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen--or by
bond-breaking between carbon and a less electronegative atom--usually hydrogen. Note that an oxidation often
adds oxygen, while a reduction often adds hydrogen.

In the laboratory, alkenes are oxidized to give epoxides on treatment with a peroxyacid, RCO3H, such as
meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. An epoxide, also called an oxirane, is a cyclic ether with an oxygen atom in a

three-membered ring. For example:

Peroxyacids transfer an oxygen atom to the alkene with syn stereochemistry--both C-O bonds form on the same
face of the double bond--through a one-step mechanism without intermediates. The oxygen atom farthest from
the carbonyl group is the one transferred.

Another method for the synthesis of epoxides involves the use of halohydrins, prepared by electrophilic
addition of HO-X to alkenes (Section 8.3). When a halohydrin is treated with base, HX is eliminated and an
epoxide is produced.

Epoxides undergo an acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction with water (a hydrolysis) to give the corresponding
1,2-dialcohol, or diol, also called a glycol. Thus, the net result of the two-step alkene epoxidation/hydrolysis is
hydroxylation--the addition of an -OH group to each of the two double-bond carbons. In fact, approximately
204 million tons of ethylene glycol, HOCH2CH2OH, most of it used for automobile antifreeze, are produced

     Acid-catalyzed epoxide opening begins with protonation of the epoxide to increase its reactivity, followed by
     nucleophilic addition of water. This nucleophilic addition is analogous to the final step of alkene bromination,
     in which a cyclic bromonium ion is opened by a nucleophile (Section 8.2). That is, a trans-1,2-diol results when
     an epoxycycloalkane is opened by aqueous acid, just as a trans-1,2-dibromide results when a cycloalkene is
     brominated. We'll look at epoxide chemistry in more detail in Section 18.6.

     Hydroxylation can also be carried out directly (without going through an intermediate epoxide) by treating
     an alkene with osmium tetroxide, OsO4. The reaction occurs with syn stereochemistry and does not involve a
     carbocation intermediate. Instead, it takes place through an intermediate cyclic osmate, which is formed in a
     single step by addition of OsO4 to the alkene. This cyclic osmate is then cleaved using aqueous sodium bisulfite,
     NaHSO3.

     Because OsO4 is both very expensive and very toxic, the reaction is usually carried out using only a small,
     catalytic amount of OsO4 in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of a safe and inexpensive co-oxidant such
     as N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, abbreviated NMO. The initially formed osmate intermediate reacts rapidly
     with NMO to yield the product diol plus N-methylmorpholine and reoxidized OsO4, which reacts with more
     alkene in a catalytic cycle.

8.8 Oxidation of Alkenes: Cleavage to Carbonyl Compounds

In all the alkene addition reactions we've seen thus far, the carbon-carbon double bond has been converted into

a single bond but the carbon skeleton has been unchanged. There are, however, powerful oxidizing reagents

that will cleave  bonds and produce two carbonyl-containing fragments.

Ozone (O3) is perhaps the most useful double-bond cleavage reagent. Prepared by passing a stream of oxygen

through a high-voltage electrical discharge, ozone adds rapidly to a     bond at low temperature to give a

cyclic intermediate called a molozonide. Once formed, the molozonide spontaneously rearranges to form an

ozonide. Although we won't study the mechanism of this rearrangement in detail, it involves the molozonide

coming apart into two fragments that then recombine in a different way.

Low-molecular-weight ozonides are explosive and therefore not isolated. Instead, the ozonide is immediately

treated with a reducing agent, such as zinc metal in acetic acid, to produce carbonyl compounds. The net result

of the ozonolysis/reduction sequence is that the       bond is cleaved and an oxygen atom becomes doubly

bonded to each of the original alkene carbons. If an alkene with a tetrasubstituted double bond is ozonized,

two ketone fragments result; if an alkene with a trisubstituted double bond is ozonized, one ketone and one

aldehyde result; and so on.
262  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     Several oxidizing reagents other than ozone also cause double-bond cleavage, although such reactions are not
     often used. For example, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in neutral or acidic solution cleaves alkenes to give
     carbonyl-containing products. If hydrogens are present on the double bond, carboxylic acids are produced; if
     two hydrogens are present on one carbon, CO2 is formed.

     In addition to direct cleavage with ozone or KMnO4, an alkene can also be cleaved in a two-step process by initial
     hydroxylation to a 1,2-diol, as discussed in the previous section, followed by treatment of the diol with periodic
     acid, HIO4. If the two -OH groups are in an open chain, two carbonyl compounds result. If the two -OH groups
     are on a ring, a single, open-chain dicarbonyl compound is formed. As indicated in the following examples, the
     cleavage reaction takes place through a cyclic periodate intermediate.

8.9 Addition of Carbenes to Alkenes: Cyclopropane Synthesis

Yet another kind of alkene addition is the reaction with a carbene to yield a cyclopropane. A carbene, R2C:, is a

neutral molecule containing a divalent carbon with only six electrons in its valence shell. It is therefore highly

reactive and generated only as a reaction intermediate, rather than as an isolable molecule. Because they're

electron-deficient, carbenes behave as electrophiles and react with nucleophilic  bonds. The reaction

occurs in a single step without intermediates.

One of the simplest methods for generating a substituted carbene is by treatment of chloroform, CHCl3, with a
strong base such as KOH. As shown in FIGURE 8.10, the loss of a proton from CHCl3 gives trichloromethanide
anion, -:CCl2, which spontaneously expels a Cl- ion to yield dichlorocarbene, :CCl2.

     which spontaneously expels a Cl- ion.

     The carbon atom in dichlorocarbene is sp2-hybridized, with a vacant p orbital extending above and below the
     plane of the three atoms and with an unshared pair of electrons occupying the third sp2 lobe. Note that this
     electronic description of dichlorocarbene is similar to that of a carbocation (Section 7.9) with respect to both the
     sp2 hybridization of carbon and the vacant p orbital. Electrostatic potential maps further illustrate the similarity
     (FIGURE 8.11).

     FIGURE 8.11 The structure of dichlorocarbene. Electrostatic potential maps show how the positive region coincides with the empty p
     orbital in both dichlorocarbene and a carbocation (CH3+). The negative region in the dichlorocarbene map coincides with the lone-pair
     electrons.

     If dichlorocarbene is generated in the presence of an alkene, addition to the double bond occurs and a
     dichlorocyclopropane is formed. As the reaction of dichlorocarbene with cis-2-pentene demonstrates, the
     addition is stereospecific, meaning that only a single stereoisomer is formed as product. Starting from a cis
     alkene, for instance, only cis-disubstituted cyclopropane is produced; starting from a trans alkene, only trans-
     disubstituted cyclopropane is produced.

The best method for preparing nonhalogenated cyclopropanes is by a process called the Simmons-Smith
reaction. First investigated at the DuPont company, this reaction does not involve a free carbene. Rather, it
utilizes a carbenoid--a metal-complexed reagent with carbene-like reactivity. When diiodomethane is treated
with a specially prepared zinc-copper mix, (iodomethyl)zinc iodide, ICH2ZnI, is formed. In the presence of an
alkene, ICH2ZnI transfers a CH2 group to the double bond to yield cyclopropane. For example, cyclohexene
reacts cleanly and with good yield to give the corresponding cyclopropane. Although we won't discuss the
mechanistic details, carbene addition to an alkene is one of a general class of reactions called cycloadditions,
which we'll study more carefully in Chapter 30.

8.10 Radical Additions to Alkenes: Chain-Growth Polymers

In our brief introduction to radical reactions in Section 6.6, we said that radicals can add to  bonds, taking

one electron from the double bond and leaving one behind to yield a new radical. Let's now look at the process

in more detail, focusing on the industrial synthesis of alkene polymers. A polymer is a large--sometimes very

large--molecule, built up by repetitive joining together of many smaller molecules, called monomers.

Nature makes wide use of biological polymers. Cellulose, for instance, is a polymer built of repeating glucose
monomer units; proteins are polymers built of repeating amino acid monomers; and nucleic acids are polymers
built of repeating nucleotide monomers.
266  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     Synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene, are much simpler chemically than biopolymers, but there is still
     a great diversity to their structures and properties, depending on the identity of the monomers and on the
     reaction conditions used for polymerization. The simplest synthetic polymers are those that result when an
     alkene is treated with a small amount of a suitable catalyst. Ethylene, for example, yields polyethylene, an
     enormous alkane that may have a molecular weight up to 6 million u and may contain as many as 200,000
     monomer units. Worldwide production of polyethylene is approximately 88 million tons per year.

     Polyethylene and other simple alkene polymers are called chain-growth polymers because they are formed
     in a chain-reaction process in which an initiator adds to a carbon-carbon double bond to yield a reactive
     intermediate. The intermediate then reacts with a second molecule of monomer to yield a new intermediate,
     which reacts with a third monomer unit, and so on.
     Historically, ethylene polymerization was carried out at high pressure (1000-3000 atm) and high temperature
     (100-250 °C) in the presence of a radical initiator such as benzoyl peroxide. Like many radical reactions, the
     mechanism of ethylene polymerization occurs in three steps: initiation, propagation, and termination:

       · Initiation The polymerization reaction is initiated when a few radicals are generated on heating a small

8.10 · Radical Additions to Alkenes: Chain-Growth Polymers                                                           267

amount of benzoyl peroxide catalyst to break the weak O-O bond. The initially formed benzoyloxy radical

loses CO2 and gives a phenyl radical (Ph·), which adds to the  bond of ethylene to start the

polymerization process. One electron from the ethylene double bond pairs up with the odd electron on the

phenyl radical to form a new C-C bond, and the other electron remains on carbon.

  · Propagation Polymerization occurs when the carbon radical formed in the initiation step adds to another
      ethylene molecule to yield another radical. Repetition of the process for hundreds or thousands of times
      builds the polymer chain.

  · Termination The chain process is eventually ended by a reaction that consumes the radical. The
      combination of two growing chains is one possible chain-terminating reaction.

Ethylene is not unique in its ability to form a polymer. Many substituted ethylenes, called vinyl monomers,
also undergo polymerization to yield polymers with substituent groups regularly spaced on alternating carbon
atoms along the chain. Propylene, for example, yields polypropylene, and styrene yields polystyrene.

When an unsymmetrically substituted vinyl monomer such as propylene or styrene is polymerized, the radical
addition steps can take place at either end of the double bond to yield either a primary radical intermediate
(RCH2·) or a secondary radical (R2CH·). Just as in electrophilic addition reactions, however, we find that only the
more highly substituted, secondary radical is formed.

8.11 Biological Additions of Radicals to Alkenes

The same high reactivity of radicals that enables the alkene polymerization we saw in the previous section also
makes it difficult to carry out controlled radical reactions on complex molecules. As a result, there are severe
limitations on the usefulness of radical addition reactions in the laboratory. In contrast to an electrophilic
addition, where reaction occurs once and the reactive cation intermediate is rapidly quenched by a nucleophile,
the reactive intermediate in a radical reaction is not usually quenched. Instead, it reacts again and again in a
largely uncontrollable way.

In biological reactions, the situation is different from that in the laboratory. Only one substrate molecule
at a time is present in the active site of an enzyme, and that molecule is held in a precise position, with
other necessary reacting groups nearby. As a result, biological radical reactions are more controlled and
more common than laboratory or industrial radical reactions. A particularly impressive example occurs in the
biosynthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, where a sequence of four radical additions take place. Its
reaction mechanism was discussed briefly in Section 6.6.

As shown in FIGURE 8.12, prostaglandin biosynthesis begins with abstraction of a hydrogen atom from C13 of
arachidonic acid by an iron-oxy radical to give a carbon radical that reacts with O2 at C11 through a resonance
form. The oxygen radical that results adds to the C8-C9 double bond to give a carbon radical at C8, which
adds to the C12-C13 double bond and gives a carbon radical at C13. A resonance form of this carbon radical
adds at C15 to a second O2 molecule, completing the prostaglandin skeleton. Reduction of the O-O bond then
gives prostaglandin H2, called PGH2. The pathway looks complicated, but the entire process is catalyzed with
exquisite control by a single enzyme.

     8.12 Reaction Stereochemistry: Addition of H2O to an Achiral Alkene

     Most of the biochemical reactions that take place in the body, as well as many organic reactions in the
     laboratory, yield products with chirality centers. For example, acid-catalyzed addition of H2O to 1-butene in
     the laboratory yields 2-butanol, a chiral alcohol. What is the stereochemistry of this chiral product? If a single
     enantiomer is formed, is it R or S? If a mixture of enantiomers is formed, how much of each? In fact, the
     2-butanol produced is a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers. Let's see why.

     To understand why a racemic product results from the reaction of H2O with 1-butene, think about the reaction

mechanism. 1-Butene is first protonated to yield an intermediate secondary carbocation. Because the trivalent
carbon is sp2-hybridized and planar, the cation has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. As a result, it can react
with H2O equally well from either the top or the bottom. Reaction from the top leads to (S)-2-butanol through
transition state 1 (TS 1) in FIGURE 8.13, and reaction from the bottom leads to (R)-2-butanol through TS 2.

But the two transition states are mirror images, so they have identical energies, form at identical rates, and are

equally likely to occur.

FIGURE 8.13 Reaction of H2O with the carbocation resulting from protonation of 1-butene. Reaction from the top leads to S product and
is the mirror image of reaction from the bottom, which leads to R product. Because they are energetically identical, they are equally likely
and lead to a racemic mixture of products. The dotted C···O bond in the transition state indicates partial bond formation.

As a general rule, the formation of a new chirality center by achiral reactants always leads to a racemic mixture
of enantiomeric products. Put another way, optical activity can't appear from nowhere; an optically active
product can only result by starting with an optically active reactant or chiral environment (Section 5.12).
In contrast to laboratory reactions, enzyme-catalyzed biological reactions often give a single enantiomer of
a chiral product, even when the substrate is achiral. One step in the citric acid cycle of food metabolism,
for instance, is the aconitase-catalyzed addition of water to (Z)-aconitate (usually called cis-aconitate) to give
isocitrate.

Even though cis-aconitate is achiral, only the (2R,3S) enantiomer of the product is formed. As discussed in
Section 5.11 and Section 5.12, cis-aconitate is a prochiral molecule, which is held in a chiral environment by
the aconitase enzyme during the reaction. In this environment, the two faces of the double bond are chemically
distinct, and addition occurs on only the Re face at C2.
272  8 · Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis

     8.13 Reaction Stereochemistry: Addition of H2O to a Chiral Alkene

     The reaction discussed in the previous section involves an addition to an achiral reactant and forms an optically
     inactive, racemic mixture of two enantiomeric products. What would happen, though, if we were to carry out
     the reaction on a single enantiomer of a chiral reactant? For example, what stereochemical result would be
     obtained from addition of H2O to a chiral alkene, such as (R)-4-methyl-1-hexene? The product of the reaction,
     4-methyl-2-hexanol, has two chirality centers and so has four possible stereoisomers.

     Let's think about the two chirality centers separately. What about the configuration at C4, the methyl-bearing
     carbon atom? Since C4 has the R configuration in the starting material and this chirality center is unaffected by
     the reaction, its configuration is unchanged. Thus, the configuration at C4 in the product remains R (assuming
     that the relative rankings of the four attached groups are not changed by the reaction).

     What about the configuration at C2, the newly formed chirality center? As shown in FIGURE 8.14, the
     stereochemistry at C2 is established by reaction of H2O with a carbocation intermediate in the usual manner.
     But this carbocation doesn't have a plane of symmetry; it is chiral because of the chirality center at C4.
     Because the carbocation is chiral and has no plane of symmetry, it doesn't react equally well from the top
     and bottom faces. One of the two faces is likely, for steric reasons, to be a bit more accessible than the other,
     leading to a mixture of R and S products in some ratio other than 50 : 50. Thus, two diastereomeric products,
     (2R,4R)-4-methyl-2-hexanol and (2S,4R)-4-methyl-2-hexanol, are formed in unequal amounts, and the mixture
     is optically active.

     FIGURE 8.14 Stereochemistry of the acid-catalyzed addition of H2O to the chiral alkene, (R)-4-methyl-1-hexene. A mixture of
     diastereomeric 2R,4R and 2S,4R products is formed in unequal amounts because reaction of the chiral carbocation intermediate is not
     equally likely from top and bottom. The product mixture is optically active.

     As a general rule, the formation of a new chirality center by a chiral reactant leads to unequal amounts of
     diastereomeric products. If the chiral reactant is optically active because only one enantiomer is used rather
     than a racemic mixture, then the products are also optically active.

Terpenes: Naturally Occurring Alkenes

Ever since its discovery in Persia around 1000 A.D., it has been known that steam distillation, the distillation of
plant materials together with water, produces a fragrant mixture of liquids called essential oils. The resulting
oils have long been used as medicines, spices, and perfumes, and their investigation played a major role in the
emergence of organic chemistry as a science during the 19th century.

FIGURE 8.15 The wonderful fragrance of leaves from the California bay laurel is due primarily to myrcene, a simple terpene. (credit:
"California Bay Umbellularia californica" by Don Loaire/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Chemically, plant essential oils consist largely of mixtures of compounds called terpenoids--small organic
molecules with an immense diversity of structure. More than 60,000 different terpenoids are known. Some
are open-chain molecules, and others contain rings; some are hydrocarbons, and others contain oxygen.
Hydrocarbon terpenoids, in particular, are known as terpenes, and all contain double bonds. For example:

Regardless of their apparent structural differences, all terpenoids are related. According to a formalism called
274 8 · Key Terms

the isoprene rule, they can be thought of as arising from head-to-tail joining of 5-carbon isoprene units
(2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). Carbon 1 is the head of the isoprene unit, and carbon 4 is the tail. For example,
myrcene contains two isoprene units joined head to tail, forming an 8-carbon chain with two 1-carbon
branches. -Pinene similarly contains two isoprene units assembled into a more complex cyclic structure, and
humulene contains three isoprene units. See if you can identify the isoprene units in -pinene, humulene, and
-santalene.

Terpenes (and terpenoids) are further classified according to the number of 5-carbon units they contain.
Thus, monoterpenes are 10-carbon substances derived from two isoprene units, sesquiterpenes are 15-carbon
molecules derived from three isoprene units, diterpenes are 20-carbon substances derived from four isoprene
units, and so on. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are found primarily in plants, but the higher terpenoids
occur in both plants and animals, and many have important biological roles. The triterpenoid lanosterol, for
instance, is the biological precursor from which all steroid hormones are made.

Isoprene itself is not the true biological precursor of terpenoids. Nature instead uses two "isoprene
equivalents"--isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate--which are themselves made by two
different routes depending on the organism. Lanosterol, in particular, is biosynthesized from acetic acid by a

Summary

With the background needed to understand organic reactions now covered, this chapter has begun the
systematic description of major functional groups.

Alkenes are generally prepared by an elimination reaction, such as dehydrohalogenation, the elimination of HX
from an alkyl halide, or dehydration, the elimination of water from an alcohol. The converse of this elimination
reaction is the addition of various substances to the alkene double bond to give saturated products.

HCl, HBr, and HI add to alkenes by a two-step electrophilic addition mechanism. Initial reaction of the
nucleophilic double bond with H+ gives a carbocation intermediate, which then reacts with halide ion. Bromine
and chlorine add to alkenes via three-membered-ring bromonium ion or chloronium ion intermediates to give
addition products having anti stereochemistry. If water is present during the halogen addition reaction, a
halohydrin is formed.

Hydration of an alkene--the addition of water--is carried out by either of two procedures, depending on the
product desired. Oxymercuration-demercuration involves electrophilic addition of Hg2+ to an alkene,
followed by trapping of the cation intermediate with water and subsequent treatment with NaBH4.
Hydroboration involves addition of borane (BH3) followed by oxidation of the intermediate organoborane
with alkaline H2O2. The two hydration methods are complementary: oxymercuration-demercuration gives the
product of Markovnikov addition, whereas hydroboration-oxidation gives the product with non-Markovnikov
syn stereochemistry.

Alkenes are reduced by addition of H2 in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum or palladium to yield
alkanes, a process called catalytic hydrogenation. Alkenes are also oxidized by reaction with a peroxyacid to
give epoxides, which can be converted into trans-1,2-diols by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The corresponding
cis-1,2-diols can be made directly from alkenes by hydroxylation with OsO4. Alkenes can also be cleaved
to produce carbonyl compounds by reaction with ozone, followed by reduction with zinc metal. In addition,
alkenes react with divalent substances called carbenes, R2C:, to give cyclopropanes. Nonhalogenated
cyclopropanes are best prepared by treatment of the alkene with CH2I2 and zinc-copper, a process called the
Simmons-Smith reaction.

Alkene polymers--large molecules resulting from repetitive bonding of many hundreds or thousands of small
monomer units--are formed by chain-reaction polymerization of simple alkenes. Polyethylene, polypropylene,
and polystyrene are examples. As a general rule, radical addition reactions are not common in the laboratory
but occur frequently in biological pathways.

Many reactions give chiral products. If the reactants are optically inactive, the products are also optically
inactive. If one or both of the reactants is optically active, the products can also be optically active.

  LEARNING REACTIONS

  What's seven times nine? Sixty-three, of course. You didn't have to stop and figure it out; you knew the
  answer immediately because you long ago learned the multiplication tables. Learning the reactions of
  organic chemistry requires the same approach: reactions have to be learned for quick recall if they are to be
  useful.

  Different people take different approaches to learning reactions. Some people make flashcards; others find
  studying with friends to be helpful. To help guide your study, most chapters in this book end with a summary
  of the reactions just presented. In addition, the accompanying Study Guide and Student Solutions Manual
  has several appendixes that organize organic reactions from other perspectives. Fundamentally, though,
  there are no shortcuts. Learning organic chemistry does take effort.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Alkynes are less common than alkenes, both in the laboratory and in living organisms,
so we won't cover them in great detail. The real importance of this chapter is that we'll use alkyne chemistry as
a vehicle to begin looking at some of the general strategies used in organic synthesis--the construction of
complex molecules in the laboratory. Without the ability to design and synthesize new molecules in the
laboratory, many of the medicines we take for granted would not exist and few new ones would be made.

An alkyne is a hydrocarbon that contains a carbon-carbon triple bond. Acetylene,  , the simplest

alkyne, was once widely used in industry as a starting material for the preparation of acetaldehyde, acetic acid,

vinyl chloride, and other high-volume chemicals, but more efficient routes to these substances using ethylene

as starting material are now available. Acetylene is still used in the preparation of acrylic polymers, such as
288  9 · Alkynes: An Introduction to Organic Synthesis

     Plexiglas and Lucite, but is probably best known as the gas burned in high-temperature oxy-acetylene welding
     torches.

     In addition to simple alkynes with one triple bond, research is also being carried out on polyynes--linear carbon
     chains of alternating single and triple bonds. Polyynes with up to eight triple bonds are thought to be present
     in interstellar space, and evidence has been presented for the existence of carbyne, an allotrope of carbon
     consisting of alternating single and triple bonds in long chains of indefinite length. The electronic properties of
     polyynes are being explored for potential use in nanotechnology applications.

     9.1 Naming Alkynes

     Alkyne nomenclature follows the general rules for hydrocarbons discussed in Section 3.4 and Section 7.3. The
     suffix -yne is used, and the position of the triple bond is indicated by giving the number of the first alkyne
     carbon in the chain. Numbering the main chain begins at the end nearer the triple bond so that the triple bond
     receives as low a number as possible.

     Compounds with more than one triple bond are called diynes, triynes, and so forth; compounds containing both
     double and triple bonds are called enynes (not ynenes). Numbering of an enyne chain starts from the end nearer
     the first multiple bond, whether double or triple. When there is a choice in numbering, double bonds receive
     lower numbers than triple bonds. For example:

     9.2 Preparation of Alkynes: Elimination Reactions of Dihalides

     Alkynes can be prepared by the elimination of HX from alkyl halides in a similar manner as alkenes (Section
     8.1). Treatment of a 1,2-dihaloalkane (called a vicinal dihalide) with an excess amount of a strong base such as
     KOH or NaNH2 results in a twofold elimination of HX and formation of an alkyne. As with the elimination of HX
     to form an alkene, we'll defer a full discussion of this topic and the relevant reaction mechanisms to Chapter 11.

The starting vicinal dihalides are themselves readily available by addition of Br2 or Cl2 to alkenes. Thus, the
overall halogenation/dehydrohalogenation sequence makes it possible to go from an alkene to an alkyne. For

example, diphenylethylene is converted into diphenylacetylene by reaction with Br2 and subsequent base
treatment.

The twofold dehydrohalogenation takes place through a vinylic halide intermediate, which suggests that vinylic
halides themselves should give alkynes when treated with strong base. (A vinylic substituent is one that is
attached to a double-bond.) This is indeed the case. For example:

9.3 Reactions of Alkynes: Addition of HX and X2

You might recall from Section 1.9 that a carbon-carbon triple bond results from the interaction of two

sp-hybridized carbon atoms. The two sp hybrid orbitals of carbon lie at an angle of 180° to each other along an

axis perpendicular to the axes of the two unhybridized 2py and 2pz orbitals. When two sp-hybridized carbons
approach each other, one sp-sp  bond and two p-p  bonds are formed. The two remaining sp orbitals form

bonds to other atoms at an angle of 180° from the carbon-carbon bond. Thus, acetylene is a linear molecule

with  bond angles of 180° (FIGURE 9.2). The length of the  bond is 120 pm, and its strength is

approximately 965 kJ/mol (231 kcal/mol), making it the shortest and strongest known carbon-carbon bond.

FIGURE 9.2 The structure of acetylene,  . The  bond angles are 180°, and the                   bond length is 120 pm. The

electrostatic potential map shows that the  bonds create a negative belt around the molecule.

As a general rule, electrophiles undergo addition reactions with alkynes much as they do with alkenes. Take the
reaction of alkynes with HX, for instance. The reaction often can be stopped with the addition of 1 equivalent
of HX, but reaction with an excess of HX leads to a dihalide product. For example, reaction of 1-hexyne with
2 equivalents of HBr yields 2,2-dibromohexane. As the following examples indicate, the regiochemistry of
addition follows Markovnikov's rule, with halogen adding to the more highly substituted side of the alkyne bond
290  9 · Alkynes: An Introduction to Organic Synthesis

     and hydrogen adding to the less highly substituted side. Trans stereochemistry of H and X normally, although
     not always, occurs in the product.

     Bromine and chlorine also add to alkynes to give addition products, and trans stereochemistry again results.

     The mechanism of alkyne addition is similar but not identical to that of alkene addition. When an electrophile
     such as HBr adds to an alkene, the reaction takes place in two steps and involves an alkyl carbocation
     intermediate (Section 7.7 and Section 7.8). If HBr were to add by the same mechanism to an alkyne, an
     analogous vinylic carbocation would be formed as the intermediate.

     A vinylic carbocation has an sp-hybridized carbon and generally forms less readily than an alkyl carbocation
     (FIGURE 9.3). As a rule, a secondary vinylic carbocation forms about as readily as a primary alkyl carbocation,
     but a primary vinylic carbocation is so difficult to form that there is no clear evidence it even exists. Thus, many
     alkyne additions occur through more complex mechanistic pathways.

perpendicular to the plane of the  bond orbitals. Only one R group is attached to the positively charged carbon rather than two, as in a
secondary alkyl carbocation. The electrostatic potential map shows that the most positive regions coincide with lobes of the vacant p orbital
and are perpendicular to the most negative regions associated with the  bond.

9.4 Hydration of Alkynes

Like alkenes (Section 8.4 and Section 8.5), alkynes can be hydrated by either of two methods. Direct addition
of water catalyzed by mercury(II) ion yields the Markovnikov product, and indirect addition of water by a
hydroboration-oxidation sequence yields the non-Markovnikov product.

Mercury(II)-Catalyzed Hydration of Alkynes

Alkynes don't react directly with aqueous acid but will undergo hydration readily in the presence of mercury(II)
sulfate as a Lewis acid catalyst. The reaction occurs with Markovnikov regiochemistry, so the -OH group adds
to the more highly substituted carbon and the -H attaches to the less highly substituted one.

Interestingly, the actual product isolated from alkyne hydration is not a vinylic alcohol, or enol (ene + ol), but is
instead a ketone. Although the enol is an intermediate in the reaction, it immediately rearranges into a ketone
by a process called keto-enol tautomerism. The individual keto and enol forms are said to be tautomers, a word
used to describe two isomers that undergo spontaneous interconversion accompanied by the change in position
of a hydrogen. With few exceptions, the keto-enol tautomeric equilibrium lies on the side of the ketone; enols
are almost never isolated. We'll look more closely at this equilibrium in Section 22.1.

As shown in FIGURE 9.4, the mechanism of the mercury(II)-catalyzed alkyne hydration reaction is analogous
to the oxymercuration reaction of alkenes (Section 8.4). Electrophilic addition of mercury(II) ion to the alkyne
gives a vinylic cation, which reacts with water and loses a proton to yield a mercury-containing enol
intermediate. In contrast with alkene oxymercuration, however, no treatment with NaBH4 is necessary to
remove the mercury. The acidic reaction conditions alone are sufficient to effect replacement of mercury by
292  9 · Alkynes: An Introduction to Organic Synthesis

     hydrogen. Tautomerization then gives the ketone.

                           tautomerizes to the ketone.

     A mixture of both possible ketones results when an unsymmetrically substituted internal alkyne (            ) is

     hydrated. The reaction is therefore most useful when applied to a terminal alkyne (  ) because only a

     methyl ketone is formed.

Hydroboration-Oxidation of Alkynes

Borane adds rapidly to an alkyne just as it does to an alkene, and the resulting vinylic borane can be oxidized
by H2O2 to give an enol, which tautomerizes to either a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the alkyne.
Hydroboration-oxidation of an internal alkyne such as 3-hexyne is straightforward and gives a ketone, but
hydroboration-oxidation of a terminal alkyne is more complex because two molecules of borane often add to
the triple bond, complicating the situation. To prevent this double addition, a bulky, sterically encumbered
borane such as bis(1,2-dimethylpropyl)borane, known commonly as disiamylborane is used in place of BH3.
When a terminal alkyne such as 1-butene reacts with disiamylborane, addition to the triple bond occurs
normally, but a second addition is hindered by the bulk of the dialkylborane. Oxidation with H2O2 then gives an
enol, which tautomerizes to the aldehyde.

The hydroboration-oxidation sequence is complementary to the direct, mercury(II)-catalyzed hydration
reaction of a terminal alkyne because different products result. Direct hydration with aqueous acid and
mercury(II) sulfate leads to a methyl ketone, whereas hydroboration-oxidation of the same terminal alkyne

     9.5 Reduction of Alkynes

     Alkynes are reduced to alkanes by addition of H2 over a metal catalyst. The reaction occurs in two steps through
     an alkene intermediate, and measurements show that the first step in the reaction is more exothermic than the
     second.

     Complete reduction to the alkane occurs when palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is used as catalyst, but
     hydrogenation can be stopped at the alkene stage if the less active Lindlar catalyst is used. The Lindlar catalyst
     is a finely divided palladium metal that has been precipitated onto a calcium carbonate support and then
     deactivated by treatment with lead acetate and quinoline, an aromatic amine. The hydrogenation occurs with
     syn stereochemistry (Section 8.5), giving a cis alkene product.

The alkyne hydrogenation reaction has been explored extensively by the Hoffmann-LaRoche pharmaceutical
company, where it is used in the commercial synthesis of vitamin A. The cis isomer of vitamin A produced
initially on hydrogenation is converted to the trans isomer by heating.

An alternative method for the conversion of an alkyne to an alkene uses sodium or lithium metal as the
reducing agent in liquid ammonia as solvent. This method is complementary to the Lindlar reduction because it
produces trans rather than cis alkenes. For example, 5-decyne gives trans-5-decene on treatment with lithium
in liquid ammonia. The mechanism is explained below.

Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia at -33 °C to produce a deep blue solution containing the metal
cation and ammonia-solvated electrons. When an alkyne is then added to the solution, reduction occurs by
the mechanism shown in FIGURE 9.5. An electron first adds to the triple bond to yield an intermediate anion
radical--a species that is both an anion (has a negative charge) and a radical (has an odd number of electrons).
This anion radical is a strong base, able to remove H+ from ammonia to give a vinylic radical. Addition of a
second electron to the vinylic radical gives a vinylic anion, which abstracts a second H+ from ammonia to give
trans alkene product.

     Trans stereochemistry of the alkene product is established during the second reduction step (3) when the

     equilibration, but vinylic anions equilibrate much less rapidly. Thus, the more stable trans vinylic anion is
     formed rather than the less stable cis anion and is then protonated without equilibration.

     9.6 Oxidative Cleavage of Alkynes

     Alkynes, like alkenes, can be cleaved by reaction with powerful oxidizing agents such as ozone or KMnO4,
     although the reaction is of little value and it is mentioned only for completeness. A triple bond is generally less
     reactive than a double bond, and yields of cleavage products can be low. The products obtained from cleavage
     of an internal alkyne are carboxylic acids; from a terminal alkyne, CO2 is formed as one product.

9.7 Alkyne Acidity: Formation of Acetylide Anions

The most striking difference between alkenes and alkynes is that terminal alkynes are relatively acidic. When
a terminal alkyne is treated with a strong base, such as sodium amide, Na+ -NH2, the terminal hydrogen is
removed and the corresponding acetylide anion is formed.

According to the Brønsted-Lowry definition (Section 2.7), an acid is a substance that donates H+. Although we

usually think of oxyacids (H2SO4, HNO3) or halogen acids (HCl, HBr) in this context, any compound containing a
hydrogen atom can be an acid under the right circumstances. By measuring dissociation constants of different
acids and expressing the results as pKa values, an acidity order can be established. Recall from Section 2.8 that
a lower pKa corresponds to a stronger acid and a higher pKa corresponds to a weaker one.

Where do hydrocarbons lie on the acidity scale? As the data in TABLE 9.1 show, both methane (pKa  60) and
ethylene (pKa = 44) are very weak acids and thus do not react with any of the common bases. Acetylene, however,
has pKa = 25 and can be deprotonated by the conjugate base of any acid whose pKa is greater than 25. Amide ion
(NH2-), for example, the conjugate base of ammonia (pKa = 35), is often used to deprotonate terminal alkynes.

Why are terminal alkynes more acidic than alkenes or alkanes? In other words, why are acetylide anions

more stable than vinylic or alkyl anions? The simplest explanation involves the hybridization of the negatively

charged carbon atom. An acetylide anion has an sp-hybridized carbon, so the negative charge resides in an
orbital that has 50% "s character." A vinylic anion has a sp2-hybridized carbon with 33% s character, and an
alkyl anion (sp3) has only 25% s character. Because s orbitals are nearer the positive nucleus and lower in

energy than p orbitals, the negative charge is stabilized to a greater extent in an orbital with higher s character

(FIGURE 9.6).

     FIGURE 9.6 A comparison of alkyl, vinylic, and acetylide anions. The acetylide anion, with sp hybridization, has more s character and
     is more stable. Electrostatic potential maps show that placing the negative charge closer to the carbon nucleus makes carbon appear less

     9.8 Alkylation of Acetylide Anions

     The negative charge and unshared electron pair on carbon make an acetylide anion strongly nucleophilic. As a
     result, an acetylide anion can react with electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, in a process that replaces the halide
     and yields a new alkyne product.

     We won't study the details of this substitution reaction until Chapter 11, but for now you can picture it as
     happening by the pathway shown in FIGURE 9.7. The nucleophilic acetylide ion uses an electron pair to form a
     bond to the positively polarized, electrophilic carbon atom of bromomethane. As the new C-C bond forms, Br-
     departs, taking with it the electron pair from the former C-Br bond and yielding propyne as product. We call
     such a reaction an alkylation because a new alkyl group has become attached to the starting alkyne.

FIGURE 9.7 MECHANISM

A mechanism for the alkylation reaction of acetylide anion with bromomethane
to give propyne.

Alkyne alkylation is not limited to acetylene itself. Any terminal alkyne can be converted into its corresponding
anion and then allowed to react with an alkyl halide to give an internal alkyne product. Hex-1-yne, for instance,
gives dec-5-yne when treated first with NaNH2 and then with 1-bromobutane.

Because of its generality, acetylide alkylation is a good method for preparing substituted alkynes from simpler
precursors. A terminal alkyne can be prepared by alkylation of acetylene itself, and an internal alkyne can be
prepared by further alkylation of a terminal alkyne.

The only limit to the alkylation reaction is that it can only use primary alkyl bromides and alkyl iodides because
acetylide ions are sufficiently strong bases to cause elimination instead of substitution when they react with
secondary and tertiary alkyl halides. For example, reaction of bromocyclohexane with propyne anion yields the
elimination product cyclohexene rather than the substitution product 1-propynylcyclohexane.

     9.9 An Introduction to Organic Synthesis

     As mentioned in the introduction, one of the purposes of this chapter is to use alkyne chemistry as a vehicle
     to begin looking at some of the general strategies used in organic synthesis--the construction of complex
     molecules in the laboratory. There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic
     compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some
     might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to
     known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done
     just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a
     highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.

     In this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here
     is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the
     uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece
     together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes
     elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw
     on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan--it helps you learn
     organic chemistry.

     There's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and
     some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't
     look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final
     product and ask, "What was the immediate precursor of that product?" For example, if the final product is
     an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product
     is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar
     catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to
     the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it,
     but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.

     Let's work several examples of increasing complexity.

Devising a Synthesis Route

How would you synthesize cis-2-hexene from 1-pentyne and an alkyl halide? More than one step is needed.

Strategy

When undertaking any synthesis problem, you should look at the product, identify the functional groups it
contains, and then ask yourself how those functional groups can be prepared. Always work retrosynthetically,
one step at a time.

The product in this case is a cis-disubstituted alkene, so the first question is, "What is an immediate precursor
of a cis-disubstituted alkene?" We know that an alkene can be prepared from an alkyne by reduction and
that the right choice of experimental conditions will allow us to prepare either a trans-disubstituted alkene
(using lithium in liquid ammonia) or a cis-disubstituted alkene (using catalytic hydrogenation over the Lindlar
catalyst). Thus, reduction of 2-hexyne by catalytic hydrogenation using the Lindlar catalyst should yield
cis-2-hexene.

Next ask, "What is an immediate precursor of 2-hexyne?" We've seen that an internal alkyne can be prepared
by alkylation of a terminal alkyne anion. In the present instance, we're told to start with 1-pentyne and an alkyl
halide. Thus, alkylation of the anion of 1-pentyne with iodomethane should yield 2-hexyne.

Solution
cis-2-Hexene can be synthesized from the given starting materials in three steps.

If you think some of the synthesis problems at the end of this chapter are difficult, try devising a synthesis
of vitamin B12 starting only from simple substances you can buy in a chemical catalog. This extraordinary
achievement was reported in 1973 as the culmination of a collaborative effort headed by Robert B. Woodward of
Harvard University and Albert Eschenmoser of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. More than
100 graduate students and postdoctoral associates contributed to the work, which took more than a decade to
complete.

Why put such extraordinary effort into the laboratory synthesis of a molecule so easily obtained from natural
sources? There are many reasons. On a basic human level, a chemist might be motivated primarily by the
challenge, much as a climber might be challenged by the ascent of a difficult peak. Beyond the pure challenge,
the completion of a difficult synthesis is also valuable in that it establishes new standards and raises the field
to a new level. If vitamin B12 can be made, then why can't any molecule found in nature be made? Indeed, the
decades that have passed since the work of Woodward and Eschenmoser have seen the laboratory synthesis of
many enormously complex and valuable substances. Sometimes these substances--for instance, the anticancer
compound paclitaxel, trade named Taxol--are not easily available in nature, so laboratory synthesis is the only

method for obtaining larger quantities.

But perhaps the most important reason for undertaking a complex synthesis is that, in so doing, new reactions
and new chemistry are discovered. It invariably happens in a complex synthesis that a point is reached at which
the planned route fails. At such a time, the only alternatives are either to quit or to devise a way around the
difficulty. New reactions and new principles come from such situations, and it is in this way that the science
of organic chemistry grows richer. In the synthesis of vitamin B12, for example, unexpected findings emerged
that led to the understanding of an entire new class of reactions--the pericyclic reactions that are the subject
of Chapter 30 in this book. From synthesizing vitamin B12 to understanding pericyclic reactions--no one could
have possibly predicted such a link at the beginning of the synthesis, but that is the way of science.

Summary

Alkynes are less common than alkenes, both in the laboratory and in living organisms, so we haven't covered
them in great detail. The real importance of this chapter is that alkyne chemistry is a useful vehicle for looking
at the general strategies used in organic synthesis--the construction of complex molecules in the laboratory.

An alkyne is a hydrocarbon that contains a carbon-carbon triple bond. Alkyne carbon atoms are sp-hybridized,
and the triple bond consists of one sp-sp  bond and two p-p  bonds. There are relatively few general methods
of alkyne synthesis. Two favorable ones are the alkylation of an acetylide anion with a primary alkyl halide and

the twofold elimination of HX from a vicinal dihalide.

The chemistry of alkynes is dominated by electrophilic addition reactions, similar to those of alkenes. Alkynes
react with HBr and HCl to yield vinylic halides and with Br2 and Cl2 to yield 1,2-dihalides (vicinal dihalides).
Alkynes can be hydrated by reaction with aqueous sulfuric acid in the presence of mercury(II) catalyst. The
reaction leads to an intermediate enol that immediately tautomerizes to yield a ketone. Because the addition
reaction occurs with Markovnikov regiochemistry, a methyl ketone is produced from a terminal alkyne.
Alternatively, hydroboration-oxidation of a terminal alkyne yields an aldehyde.

Alkynes can be reduced to yield alkenes and alkanes. Complete reduction of the triple bond over a palladium
hydrogenation catalyst yields an alkane; partial reduction by catalytic hydrogenation over a Lindlar catalyst
yields a cis alkene. Reduction of the alkyne with lithium in ammonia yields a trans alkene.

Terminal alkynes are weakly acidic. The alkyne hydrogen can be removed by a strong base such as Na+ -NH2 to
yield an acetylide anion. An acetylide anion acts as a nucleophile and can displace a halide ion from a primary
alkyl halide in an alkylation reaction. Acetylide anions are more stable than either alkyl anions or vinylic anions
because their negative charge is in a hybrid orbital with 50% s character, allowing the charge to be closer to the
nucleus.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Alkyl halides are encountered less frequently than their oxygen-containing relatives and
are not often involved in the biochemical pathways of terrestrial organisms, but some of the kinds of reactions
they undergo--nucleophilic substitutions and eliminations--are encountered frequently. Thus, alkyl halide
chemistry is a relatively simple model for many mechanistically similar but structurally more complex
reactions found in biomolecules. We'll begin this chapter with a look at how to name and prepare alkyl halides,
and we'll see several of their reactions. Then, in the next chapter, we'll make a detailed study of the substitution
and elimination reactions of alkyl halides--two of the most important and well-studied reaction types in organic
chemistry.
Now that we've covered the chemistry of hydrocarbons, it's time to start looking at more complex substances
that contain elements in addition to C and H. We'll begin by discussing the chemistry of organohalides,
316  10 · Organohalides

     compounds that contain one or more halogen atoms.

     Halogen-substituted organic compounds are widespread in nature, and more than 5000 organohalides have
     been found in algae and various other marine organisms. Chloromethane, for instance, is released in large
     amounts by ocean kelp, as well as by forest fires and volcanoes. Halogen-containing compounds also have an
     array of industrial applications, including their use as solvents, inhaled anesthetics in medicine, refrigerants,
     and pesticides.

     Still other halo-substituted compounds are used as medicines and food additives. The nonnutritive sweetener
     sucralose, marketed as Splenda, contains three chlorine atoms, for instance. Sucralose is about 600 times as
     sweet as sucrose, so only 1 mg is equivalent to an entire teaspoon of table sugar.

     A large variety of organohalides are known. The halogen might be bonded to an alkynyl group (  ), a

     vinylic group (     ), an aromatic ring (Ar-X), or an alkyl group. In this chapter, however, we'll be primarily

     concerned with alkyl halides, compounds with a halogen atom bonded to a saturated, sp3-hybridized carbon

     atom.

     10.1 Names and Structures of Alkyl Halides

     Although commonly called alkyl halides, halogen-substituted alkanes are named systematically as haloalkanes
     (Section 3.4), treating the halogen as a substituent on a parent alkane chain. There are three steps:

     STEP 1
     Find the longest chain, and name it as the parent. If a double or triple bond is present, the parent chain must
     contain it.

     STEP 2
     Number the carbons of the parent chain beginning at the end nearer the first substituent, whether alkyl or
     halo. Assign each substituent a number according to its position on the chain.

     If different halogens are present, number each one and list them in alphabetical order when writing the name.

     STEP 3
     If the parent chain can be properly numbered from either end by step 2, begin at the end nearer the

substituent that has alphabetical precedence.

In addition to their systematic names, many simple alkyl halides are also named by identifying first the alkyl
group and then the halogen. For example, CH3I can be called either iodomethane or methyl iodide. Such names
are well entrenched in the chemical literature and in daily usage, but they won't be used in this book.

Halogens increase in size going down the periodic table, so the lengths of the corresponding carbon-halogen
bonds increase accordingly (TABLE 10.1). In addition, C-X bond strengths decrease going down the periodic
table. As we've been doing thus far, we'll continue using an X to represent any of the halogens F, Cl, Br, or I.

electronegative than carbon. The C-X bond is therefore polar, with the carbon atom bearing a slight positive
charge (+) and the halogen a slight negative charge (-). This polarity results in a dipole moment for all the
halomethanes (TABLE 10.1) and implies that the alkyl halide C-X carbon atom should behave as an electrophile
in polar reactions. We'll soon see that this is indeed the case.

     10.2 Preparing Alkyl Halides from Alkanes: Radical Halogenation

     As we saw briefly in Section 6.6, simple alkyl halides can sometimes be prepared by the radical reaction of an
     alkane with Cl2 or Br2 in the presence of ultraviolet light. The detailed mechanism is shown in FIGURE 10.2 for
     chlorination.

     FIGURE 10.2 Mechanism of the radical chlorination of methane. Three kinds of steps are required in radical substitution reactions:
     initiation, propagation, and termination. The propagation steps are a repeating cycle, with Cl· a reactant in step 1 and a product in step 2, and
     with ·CH3 a product in step 1 and a reactant in step 2. The symbol h shown in the initiation step is the standard way of indicating irradiation
     with light ( is the lowercase Greek letter nu).

     Radical substitution reactions require three kinds of steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. Once an
     initiation step has started the process by producing radicals, the reaction continues in a self-sustaining cycle.
     The cycle requires two repeating propagation steps in which a radical, the halogen, and the alkane yield alkyl
     halide product plus more radical to carry on the chain. The chain is occasionally terminated by the combination
     of two radicals.
     Unfortunately, alkane halogenation is a poor synthetic method for preparing alkyl halides because mixtures of
     products invariably result. For example, chlorination of methane does not stop cleanly at the monochlorinated
     stage but continues to give a mixture of dichloro, trichloro, and even tetrachloro products.

     The situation is even worse for chlorination of alkanes that have more than one kind of hydrogen. Chlorination
     of butane, for instance, gives two monochlorinated products in a 30 : 70 ratio in addition to multiply chlorinated
     products such as dichlorobutane, trichlorobutane, and so on.

As another example, 2-methylpropane yields 2-chloro-2-methylpropane and 1-chloro-2-methylpropane in a
35 : 65 ratio, along with more highly chlorinated products.

From these and similar reactions, it's possible to calculate a reactivity order toward chlorination for different
kinds of hydrogen atoms in a molecule. Take the butane chlorination, for instance. Butane has six equivalent
primary hydrogens (-CH3) and four equivalent secondary hydrogens (-CH2-). The fact that butane yields 30%
of 1-chlorobutane product means that each one of the six primary hydrogens is responsible for 30% ÷ 6 = 5%
of the product. Similarly, the fact that 70% of 2-chlorobutane is formed means that each of the four secondary
hydrogens is responsible for 70% ÷ 4 = 17.5% of the product. Thus, a secondary hydrogen reacts 17.5% ÷ 5% =
3.5 times as often as a primary hydrogen.
A similar calculation for the chlorination of 2-methylpropane indicates that each of the nine primary hydrogens
accounts for 65% ÷ 9 = 7.2% of the product, while the single tertiary hydrogen (R3CH) accounts for 35% of
the product. Thus, a tertiary hydrogen is 35% ÷ 7.2% = 5 times as reactive as a primary hydrogen toward
chlorination.

The observed reactivity order of alkane hydrogens toward radical chlorination can be explained by looking at
the bond dissociation energies given previously in TABLE 6.3. The data show that a tertiary C-H bond (400 kJ/
mol; 96 kcal/mol) is weaker than a secondary C-H bond (410 kJ/mol; 98 kcal/mol), which is in turn weaker
than a primary C-H bond (421 kJ/mol; 101 kcal/mol). Since less energy is needed to break a tertiary C-H bond
than to break a primary or secondary C-H bond, the resultant tertiary radical is more stable than a primary or
secondary radical.

     10.3 Preparing Alkyl Halides from Alkenes: Allylic Bromination

     We've already seen several methods for preparing alkyl halides from alkenes, including the reactions of HX
     and X2 with alkenes in electrophilic addition reactions (Section 7.7 and Section 8.2). The hydrogen halides HCl,
     HBr, and HI react with alkenes by a polar mechanism to give the product of Markovnikov addition. Bromine and
     chlorine undergo anti addition through halonium ion intermediates to give 1,2-dihalogenated products.

     Another laboratory method for preparing alkyl halides from alkenes is by reaction with N-bromosuccinimide
     (abbreviated NBS), in the presence of ultraviolet light, to give products resulting from substitution of hydrogen
     by bromine at the position next to the double bond--the allylic position. Cyclohexene, for example, gives
     3-bromocyclohexene.

     This allylic bromination with NBS is analogous to the alkane chlorination reaction discussed in the previous
     section and occurs by a radical chain-reaction pathway (FIGURE 10.3). As in alkane halogenation, a Br· radical
     abstracts an allylic hydrogen atom, forming an allylic radical plus HBr. The HBr then reacts with NBS to form
     Br2, which in turn reacts with the allylic radical to yield the brominated product and a Br· radical that cycles
     back into the first step and carries on the chain.

     FIGURE 10.3 Mechanism of allylic bromination of an alkene with NBS. The process is a radical chain reaction in which (1) a Br· radical
     abstracts an allylic hydrogen atom of the alkene and gives an allylic radical plus HBr. (2) The HBr then reacts with NBS to form Br2, which (3)
     reacts with the allylic radical to yield the bromoalkene product and a Br· radical that continues the chain.

     Why does bromination with NBS occur exclusively at an allylic position rather than elsewhere in the molecule?

kinds of radicals. Although a typical secondary alkyl C-H bond has a strength of about 410 kJ/mol (98 kcal/mol)
and a typical vinylic C-H bond has a strength of 465 kJ/mol (111 kcal/mol), an allylic C-H bond has a strength of
only about 370 kJ/mol (88 kcal/mol). An allylic radical is therefore more stable than a typical alkyl radical with
the same substitution by about 40 kJ/mol (9 kcal/mol).

We can thus expand the stability ordering to include vinylic and allylic radicals.

10.4 Stability of the Allyl Radical: Resonance Revisited

To see why an allylic radical is so stable, look at the orbital picture in FIGURE 10.4. The radical carbon atom
with an unpaired electron can adopt sp2 hybridization, placing the unpaired electron in a p orbital and giving
a structure that is electronically symmetrical. The p orbital on the central carbon can therefore overlap equally
well with a p orbital on either of the two neighboring carbons.

FIGURE 10.4 An orbital view of the allyl radical. The p orbital on the central carbon can overlap equally well with a p orbital on either
neighboring carbon, giving rise to two equivalent resonance structures.

Because the allyl radical is electronically symmetrical, it has two resonance forms--one with the unpaired
electron on the left and the double bond on the right and another with the unpaired electron on the right and the
double bond on the left. Neither structure is correct by itself; the true structure of the allyl radical is a resonance
hybrid of the two. (You might want to review Section 2.4 to Section 2.6 to brush up on resonance.) As noted
in Section 2.5, the greater the number of resonance forms, the greater the stability of a compound, because
bonding electrons are attracted to more nuclei. An allyl radical, with two resonance forms, is therefore more
stable than a typical alkyl radical, which has only a single structure.

In molecular orbital terms, the stability of the allyl radical is due to the fact that the unpaired electron is
delocalized, or spread out, over an extended -orbital network rather than localized at only one site, as shown
322  10 · Organohalides

     by the computer-generated MO in FIGURE 10.4. This delocalization is particularly apparent in the so-called
     spin-density surface in FIGURE 10.5, which shows the calculated location of the unpaired electron. The two
     terminal carbons share the unpaired electron equally.

     FIGURE 10.5 The spin density surface of the allyl radical locates the position of the unpaired electron and shows that it is equally
     shared between the two terminal carbons.

     In addition to its effect on stability, delocalization of the unpaired electron in the allyl radical has other chemical
     consequences. Because the unpaired electron is delocalized over both ends of the  orbital system, reaction
     with Br2 can occur at either end. As a result, allylic bromination of an unsymmetrical alkene often leads
     to a mixture of products. For example, bromination of 1-octene gives a mixture of 3-bromo-1-octene and
     1-bromo-2-octene. The two products are not formed in equal amounts, however, because the intermediate
     allylic radical is not symmetrical and reaction at the two ends is not equally likely. Reaction at the less hindered,
     primary end is favored.

     The products of allylic bromination reactions are useful for conversion into dienes by dehydrohalogenation with
     base. Cyclohexene can be converted into 1,3-cyclohexadiene, for example.

Strategy
Draw the alkene reactant, and identify the allylic positions. In this case, there are two different allylic positions;
we'll label them A and B. Now abstract an allylic hydrogen from each position to generate the two corresponding
allylic radicals. Each of the two allylic radicals can add a Br atom at either end (A or A; B or B), to give a mixture
of up to four products. Draw and name the products. In the present instance, the "two" products from reaction

10.5 Preparing Alkyl Halides from Alcohols

The most generally useful method for preparing alkyl halides is to make them from alcohols, which themselves
can be obtained from carbonyl compounds as we'll see in Sections 17.4 and 17.5. Because of the importance
of this process, many different methods have been developed to transform alcohols into alkyl halides. The
simplest method is to treat the alcohol with HCl, HBr, or HI. For reasons that will be discussed in Section 11.5,
this reaction works best with tertiary alcohols, R3COH. Primary and secondary alcohols react much more slowly
and at higher temperatures.
324  10 · Organohalides

     The reaction of HX with a tertiary alcohol is so rapid that it's often carried out simply by bubbling pure HCl
     or HBr gas into a cold ether solution of the alcohol. 1-Methylcyclohexanol, for example, is converted into
     1-chloro-1-methylcyclohexane by treatment with HCl.

     Primary and secondary alcohols are best converted into alkyl halides by treatment with either thionyl chloride
     (SOCl2) or phosphorus tribromide (PBr3). These reactions, which normally take place readily under mild
     conditions, are less acidic and less likely to cause acid-catalyzed rearrangements than the HX method.

     As the preceding examples indicate, the yields of these SOCl2 and PBr3 reactions are generally high and
     other functional groups such as ethers, carbonyls, and aromatic rings don't usually interfere. We'll look at the
     mechanisms of these and other related substitution reactions in Section 11.3.

     Alkyl fluorides can also be prepared from alcohols. Numerous alternative reagents are used for such reactions,
     including diethylaminosulfur trifluoride [(CH3CH2)2NSF3] and HF in pyridine solvent.

10.6 Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Grignard Reagents

Alkyl halides, RX, react with magnesium metal in ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent to yield
alkylmagnesium halides, RMgX. The products, called Grignard reagents (RMgX) after their discoverer,
Francois Auguste Victor Grignard, who received the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are examples of
organometallic compounds because they contain a carbon-metal bond. In addition to alkyl halides, Grignard
reagents can also be made from alkenyl (vinylic) and aryl (aromatic) halides. The halogen can be Cl, Br, or I,
although chlorides are less reactive than bromides and iodides. Organofluorides rarely react with magnesium.

As you might expect from the discussion of electronegativity and bond polarity in Section 6.3, the
carbon-magnesium bond is polarized, making the carbon atom of Grignard reagents both nucleophilic and
basic. An electrostatic potential map of methylmagnesium iodide, for instance, indicates the electron-rich (red)
character of the carbon bonded to magnesium.

A Grignard reagent is formally the magnesium salt, R3C-+MgX, of a carbon acid, R3C-H, and is thus a carbon
anion, or carbanion. But because hydrocarbons are such weak acids, with pKa's in the range 44 to 60 (Section
9.7), carbon anions are very strong bases. Grignard reagents must therefore be protected from atmospheric

moisture to prevent their being protonated and destroyed in acid-base reactions: R-Mg-X + H2O  R-H +
HO-Mg-X.

Grignard reagents themselves don't occur in living organisms, but they serve as useful carbon-based
nucleophiles in several important laboratory reactions, which we'll look at in detail in Section 17.5. In addition,
they act as a simple model for other, more complex carbon-based nucleophiles that are important in biological
chemistry. We'll see many examples of these in Chapter 29.

     10.7 Organometallic Coupling Reactions

     Many other kinds of organometallic compounds can be prepared in a manner similar to that of Grignard
     reagents. For instance, alkyllithium reagents, RLi, can be prepared by the reaction of an alkyl halide with lithium
     metal. Alkyllithiums are both nucleophiles and strong bases, and their chemistry is similar in many respects to
     that of alkylmagnesium halides.

     One particularly valuable reaction of alkyllithiums occurs when making lithium diorganocopper compounds,
     R2CuLi, by reaction with copper(I) iodide in diethyl ether as solvent. Often called Gilman reagents (LiR2Cu),
     lithium diorganocopper compounds are useful because they undergo a coupling reaction with organochlorides,
     bromides, and iodides (but not fluorides). One of the alkyl groups from the lithium diorganocopper reagent
     replaces the halogen of the organohalide, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and yielding a hydrocarbon
     product. Lithium dimethylcopper, for instance, reacts with 1-iododecane to give undecane in a 90% yield.

     This organometallic coupling reaction is useful in organic synthesis because it forms carbon-carbon bonds,
     thereby allowing the preparation of larger molecules from smaller ones. As the following examples indicate, the
     coupling reaction can be carried out on aryl and vinylic halides as well as on alkyl halides.

     An organocopper coupling reaction is carried out commercially to synthesize muscalure, (9Z)-tricosene, the
     sex attractant secreted by the common housefly. Minute amounts of muscalure greatly increase the lure of
     insecticide-treated fly bait and provide an effective and species-specific means of insect control.

     The mechanism of the coupling reaction involves initial formation of a triorganocopper intermediate, followed

by coupling and loss of a mono-organocopper, RCu. The coupling is not a typical polar nucleophilic substitution
reaction of the sort considered in the next chapter.

In addition to the coupling reaction of diorganocopper reagents with organohalides, related processes also
occur with other organometallic reagents, particularly organopalladium compounds. One of the most
commonly used procedures is the coupling reaction of an aromatic or vinyl substituted boronic acid [R--B(OH)2]
with an aromatic or vinyl substituted organohalide in the presence of a base and a palladium catalyst. This
reaction is less general than the diorganocopper reaction because it doesn't work with alkyl substrates, but it
is preferred when possible because it uses only a catalytic amount of metal rather than a full equivalent and
because palladium compounds are less toxic than copper compounds. For example:

Called the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, this process is particularly useful for preparing so-called biaryl
compounds, which have two linked aromatic rings. A large number of commonly used drugs fit this description,
so the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction is much-used in the pharmaceutical industry. As an example, valsartan,
marketed as Diovan, is widely prescribed to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney
disease. Its synthesis begins with a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of ortho-chlorobenzonitrile with
para-methylbenzeneboronic acid.

Shown in a simplified form in FIGURE 10.6, the mechanism of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction involves initial
reaction of the aromatic halide with the palladium catalyst to form an organopalladium intermediate, followed
by reaction of that intermediate with the aromatic boronic acid. The resultant diorganopalladium complex then
decomposes to the coupled biaryl product plus regenerated catalyst.

     10.8 Oxidation and Reduction in Organic Chemistry

     We've pointed out on several occasions that some of the reactions discussed in this and earlier chapters are
     either oxidations or reductions. As noted in Section 8.7, an organic oxidation results in a loss of electron density
     by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a more electronegative atom (usually O, N,
     or a halogen) or by bond-breaking between carbon and a less electronegative atom (usually H). Conversely, an
     organic reduction results in a gain of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between
     carbon and a less electronegative atom or by bond-breaking between carbon and a more electronegative atom
     (Section 8.6).

     Based on these definitions, the chlorination reaction of methane to yield chloromethane is an oxidation because
     a C-H bond is broken and a C-Cl bond is formed. The conversion of an alkyl chloride to an alkane via a Grignard
     reagent followed by protonation is a reduction, however, because a C-Cl bond is broken and a C-H bond is
     formed.

As other examples, the reaction of an alkene with Br2 to yield a 1,2-dibromide is an oxidation because two C-Br
bonds are formed, but the reaction of an alkene with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide is neither an oxidation nor a
reduction because both a C-H and a C-Br bond are formed.

A list of compounds of increasing oxidation level is shown in FIGURE 10.7. Alkanes are at the lowest oxidation
level because they have the maximum possible number of C-H bonds per carbon, and CO2 is at the highest
level because it has the maximum possible number of C-O bonds per carbon. Any reaction that converts a
compound from a lower level to a higher level is an oxidation, any reaction that converts a compound from a
higher level to a lower level is a reduction, and any reaction that doesn't change the level is neither an oxidation
nor a reduction.

Naturally Occurring Organohalides

Just forty years ago in 1980, only about 30 naturally occurring organohalides were known. It was simply
assumed that chloroform, halogenated phenols, chlorinated aromatic compounds called PCBs, and other such
substances found in the environment were industrial pollutants. Now, less than half a century later, the situation
is quite different. More than 5000 organohalides have been found to occur naturally, and tens of thousands
more surely exist. From a simple compound like chloromethane to an extremely complex one like the antibiotic
vancomycin, a remarkably diverse range of organohalides exists in plants, bacteria, and animals. Many even
have valuable physiological activity. The pentahalogenated alkene halomon, for instance, has been isolated
from the red alga Portieria hornemannii and found to have anticancer activity against several human tumor cell
lines.

Some naturally occurring organohalides are produced in massive quantities. Forest fires, volcanic eruptions,
and marine kelp release up to 5 million tons of CH3Cl per year, for example, while annual industrial emissions
total about 26,000 tons. Termites are thought to release as much as 108 kg of chloroform per year. A detailed
examination of the Okinawan acorn worm Ptychodera flava found that the 64 million worms living in a 1 km2
study area excreted nearly 8000 pounds per year of bromophenols and bromoindoles, compounds previously
thought to be non-natural pollutants.
Why do organisms produce organohalides, many of which are undoubtedly toxic? The answer seems to be
that many organisms use organohalogen compounds for self-defense, either as feeding deterrents, irritants
to predators, or natural pesticides. Marine sponges, coral, and sea hares, for example, release foul-tasting
organohalides that deter fish, starfish, and other predators. Even humans appear to produce halogenated
compounds as part of their defense against infection. The human immune system contains a peroxidase
enzyme capable of carrying out halogenation reactions on fungi and bacteria, thereby killing the pathogen. And
most remarkable of all, even free chlorine--Cl2--has been found to be present in humans.

Summary

Alkyl halides are not often found in terrestrial organisms, but the kinds of reactions they undergo are among
the most important and well-studied reaction types in organic chemistry. In this chapter, we saw how to name
and prepare alkyl halides, and we'll soon make a detailed study of their substitution and elimination reactions.

Simple alkyl halides can be prepared by radical halogenation of alkanes, but mixtures of products usually result.
The reactivity order of alkanes toward halogenation is identical to the stability order of radicals: R3C· > R2CH·
> RCH2·. Alkyl halides can also be prepared from alkenes by reaction with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to give
the product of allylic bromination. The NBS bromination of alkenes takes place through an intermediate allylic
radical, which is stabilized by resonance.

Alcohols react with HX to form alkyl halides, but the reaction works well only for tertiary alcohols, R3COH.
Primary and secondary alkyl halides are normally prepared from alcohols using either SOCl2, PBr3, or HF
in pyridine. Alkyl halides react with magnesium in ether solution to form organomagnesium halides, called

Grignard reagents (RMgX), which are both nucleophilic and strongly basic.

Alkyl halides also react with lithium metal to form organolithium reagents, RLi. In the presence of CuI, these
form diorganocoppers, or Gilman reagents (LiR2Cu). Gilman reagents react with organohalides to yield
coupled hydrocarbon products.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely
occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll
look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be
used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.
We saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon
atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar
reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/
base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo
340  11 · Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations

     elimination of HX to yield an alkene.

     11.1 The Discovery of Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions

     Discovery of the nucleophilic substitution reaction of alkyl halides dates back to work carried out by the German
     chemist Paul Walden in 1896. Walden found that the pure enantiomeric (+)- and (-)-malic acids could be
     interconverted through a series of simple substitution reactions. When Walden treated (-)-malic acid with PCl5,
     he isolated (+)-chlorosuccinic acid. This, on treatment with wet Ag2O, gave (+)-malic acid. Similarly, reaction of
     (+)-malic acid with PCl5 gave (-)-chlorosuccinic acid, which was converted into (-)-malic acid when treated with
     wet Ag2O. The full cycle of reactions is shown in FIGURE 11.2.

                                          FIGURE 11.2 Walden's cycle of reactions interconverting (+)- and (-)-malic acids.

     At the time, the results were astonishing. The eminent chemist Emil Fischer called Walden's discovery "the
     most remarkable observation made in the field of optical activity since the fundamental observations of
     Pasteur." Because (-)-malic acid was converted into (+)-malic acid, some reactions in the cycle must have
     occurred with a change, or inversion, of configuration at the chirality center. But which ones, and how?
     (Remember from Section 5.5 that the direction of light rotation and the configuration of a chirality center aren't
     directly related. You can't tell by looking at the sign of rotation whether a change in configuration has occurred
     during a reaction.)

     Today, we refer to the transformations taking place in Walden's cycle as nucleophilic substitution reactions
     because each step involves the substitution of one nucleophile (chloride ion, Cl-, or hydroxide ion, HO-) by
     another. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic
     chemistry.

     Following the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the
     mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among
     the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3).
     Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate
     (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by
     Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In
     fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're

dealing with an alkyl halide.)

FIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol. Chirality centers are marked by asterisks,
and the bonds broken in each reaction are indicated by red wavy lines. The inversion of chirality occurs in step 2, where acetate ion
substitutes for tosylate ion.

In the three-step reaction sequence shown in FIGURE 11.3, (+)-1-phenyl-2-propanol is interconverted with its
(-) enantiomer, so at least one of the three steps must involve an inversion of configuration at the chirality
center. Step 1, formation of a tosylate, occurs by breaking the O-H bond of the alcohol rather than the C-O
bond to the chiral carbon, so the configuration around the carbon is unchanged. Similarly, step 3, hydroxide-ion
cleavage of the acetate, takes place without breaking the C-O bond at the chirality center. Thus, the inversion of
stereochemical configuration must take place in step 2, the nucleophilic substitution of tosylate ion by acetate
ion.

From this and nearly a dozen other series of similar reactions, researchers concluded that the nucleophilic
substitution reaction of a primary or secondary alkyl halide or tosylate always proceeds with inversion of
configuration. (Tertiary alkyl halides and tosylates, as we'll see shortly, give different stereochemical results and
react by a different mechanism than the primary and secondary ones.)

                      stereochemistry of both the reactant and product.

     11.2 The SN2 Reaction

     In almost all chemical reactions, there is a direct relationship between the rate at which the reaction occurs
     and the concentrations of the reactants. When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the
     reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution--the reaction of CH3Br with
     OH- to yield CH3OH plus Br-.

     With a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we
     double the concentration of OH-, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find
     that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of CH3Br, the reaction rate again
     doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species,
     a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic
     substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [RX] or [-OH] changes, the rate of the reaction
     changes proportionately.

     where

     A mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are
     observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes

and Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the SN2 reaction--short for substitution, nucleophilic,
bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose
kinetics are measured.)

The essential feature of the SN2 mechanism is that it takes place in a single step, without intermediates, when
the incoming nucleophile reacts with the alkyl halide or tosylate (the substrate) from a direction opposite
the group that is displaced (the leaving group). As the nucleophile comes in on one side of the substrate and
bonds to the carbon, the halide or tosylate departs from the other side, thereby inverting the stereochemical
configuration. The process is shown in FIGURE 11.4 for the reaction of (S)-2-bromobutane with HO- to give
(R)-2-butanol.

                      FIGURE 11.4 MECHANISM

                      The mechanism of the SN2 reaction. The reaction takes place in a single step when
                      the incoming nucleophile approaches from a direction 180° away from the leaving
                      halide ion, thereby inverting the stereochemistry at carbon.

As shown in FIGURE 11.4, the SN2 reaction occurs when an electron pair on the nucleophile Nu:- forces out
the group X:-, which takes with it the electron pair from the former C-X bond. This occurs through a transition
state in which the new Nu-C bond is partially formed at the same time that the old C-X bond is partially broken
and in which the negative charge is shared by both the incoming nucleophile and the outgoing halide ion. The
transition state for this inversion has the remaining three bonds to carbon in a planar arrangement (FIGURE
11.5).

     FIGURE 11.5 The transition state of an SN2 reaction has a planar arrangement of the carbon atom and the remaining three groups.
     Electrostatic potential maps show that negative charge is delocalized in the transition state.

     The mechanism proposed by Hughes and Ingold is fully consistent with experimental results, explaining both
     stereochemical and kinetic data. Thus, the requirement for a backside approach of the entering nucleophile
     (180° away from the departing X group) causes the stereochemistry of the substrate to invert, much like
     an umbrella turning inside-out in the wind. The Hughes-Ingold mechanism also explains why second-order
     kinetics are observed: the SN2 reaction occurs in a single step that involves both alkyl halide and nucleophile.
     Two molecules are involved in the step whose rate is measured.

     11.3 Characteristics of the SN2 Reaction

     Now that we know how SN2 reactions occur, we need to see how they can be used and what variables affect
     them. Some SN2 reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield.
     Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about
     reaction rates in general.
     The rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy G, the energy difference between
     reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect G either by changing
     the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or
     raising the transition-state energy increases G and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or

decreasing the transition-state energy decreases G and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see
examples of all these effects as we look at SN2 reaction variables.

FIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate. (a) A higher reactant energy level (red
curve) corresponds to a faster reaction (smaller G). (b) A higher transition-state energy level (red curve) corresponds to a slower reaction
(larger G).

Steric Effects in the SN2 Reaction

The first SN2 reaction variable to look at is the structure of the substrate. Because the SN2 transition state
involves partial bond formation between the incoming nucleophile and the alkyl halide carbon atom, it seems
reasonable that a hindered, bulky substrate should prevent easy approach of the nucleophile, making bond
formation difficult. In other words, the transition state for reaction of a sterically hindered substrate, whose
carbon atom is "shielded" from the approach of the incoming nucleophile, is higher in energy and forms more
slowly than the corresponding transition state for a less hindered substrate (FIGURE 11.7).

FIGURE 11.7 Steric hindrance to the SN2 reaction. As the models indicate, the carbon atom in (a) bromomethane is readily accessible,
resulting in a fast SN2 reaction. The carbon atoms in (b) bromoethane (primary), (c) 2-bromopropane (secondary), and (d)
2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tertiary) are successively more hindered, resulting in successively slower SN2 reactions.

As FIGURE 11.7 shows, the difficulty of nucleophile approach increases as the three substituents bonded to
the halo-substituted carbon atom increase in size. Methyl halides are by far the most reactive substrates in
SN2 reactions, followed by primary alkyl halides such as ethyl and propyl. Alkyl branching at the reacting
center, as in isopropyl halides (2°), slows the reaction greatly, and further branching, as in tert-butyl halides
(3°), effectively halts the reaction. Even branching one carbon away from the reacting center, as in
2,2-dimethylpropyl (neopentyl) halides, greatly hinders nucleophilic displacement. As a result, SN2 reactions
occur only at relatively unhindered sites and are normally useful only with methyl halides, primary halides, and
a few simple secondary halides. Relative reactivities for some different substrates are as follows:

     toward SN2 displacement. This lack of reactivity is due to steric factors: the incoming nucleophile would have to

     approach in the plane of the carbon-carbon double bond and burrow through part of the molecule to carry out

     a backside displacement.

     The Nucleophile

     Another variable that has a major effect on the SN2 reaction is the nature of the nucleophile. Any species, either
     neutral or negatively charged, can act as a nucleophile as long as it has an unshared pair of electrons; that is,
     as long as it is a Lewis base. If the nucleophile is negatively charged, the product is neutral; if the nucleophile is
     neutral, the product is positively charged.

     A wide array of substances can be prepared using nucleophilic substitution reactions. In fact, we've already
     seen examples in previous chapters. For instance, the reaction of an acetylide anion with an alkyl halide,
     discussed in Section 9.8, is an SN2 reaction in which the acetylide nucleophile displaces a halide leaving group.

     TABLE 11.1 lists some nucleophiles in the order of their reactivity, shows the products of their reactions with
     bromomethane, and gives the relative rates of their reactions. There are large differences in the rates at which
     various nucleophiles react.

What are the reasons for the reactivity differences observed in TABLE 11.1? Why do some reactants appear to
be much more "nucleophilic" than others? The answers to these questions aren't straightforward. Part of the
problem is that the term nucleophilicity is imprecise. The term is usually taken to be a measure of the affinity
of a nucleophile for a carbon atom in the SN2 reaction, but the reactivity of a given nucleophile can change from
one reaction to the next. The exact nucleophilicity of a species in a given reaction depends on the substrate, the
solvent, and even the reactant concentrations. Detailed explanations for the observed nucleophilicities aren't
always simple, but some trends can be detected from the data of TABLE 11.1.

  · Nucleophilicity roughly parallels basicity when comparing nucleophiles that have the same reacting
      atom. Thus, OH- is both more basic and more nucleophilic than acetate ion, CH3CO2-, which in turn is more
      basic and more nucleophilic than H2O. Since "nucleophilicity" is usually taken as the affinity of a Lewis
      base for a carbon atom in the SN2 reaction and "basicity" is the affinity of a base for a proton, it's easy to see
      why there might be a correlation between the two kinds of behavior.

  · Nucleophilicity usually increases going down a column of the periodic table. Thus, HS- is more
      nucleophilic than HO-, and the halide reactivity order is I- > Br- > Cl-. Going down the periodic table,
      elements have their valence electrons in successively larger shells where they are successively farther from
      the nucleus, less tightly held, and consequently more reactive. This matter is complex, though, and the
      nucleophilicity order can change depending on the solvent.

  · Negatively charged nucleophiles are usually more reactive than neutral ones. As a result, SN2 reactions
      are often carried out under basic conditions rather than neutral or acidic conditions.

The Leaving Group

Still another variable that can affect the SN2 reaction is the nature of the group displaced by the incoming
348  11 · Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations

     nucleophile, the leaving group. Because the leaving group is expelled with a negative charge in most SN2
     reactions, the best leaving groups are those that best stabilize the negative charge in the transition state. The

     greater the extent of charge stabilization by the leaving group, the lower the energy of the transition state and

     the more rapid the reaction. But as we saw in Section 2.8, the groups that best stabilize a negative charge are
     also the weakest bases. Thus, weak bases such as Cl-, Br-, and tosylate ion make good leaving groups, while
     strong bases such as OH- and NH2- make poor leaving groups.

     It's just as important to know which are poor leaving groups as to know which are good, and the preceding data
     clearly indicate that F-, HO-, RO-, and H2N- are not displaced by nucleophiles. In other words, alkyl fluorides,
     alcohols, ethers, and amines do not typically undergo SN2 reactions. To carry out an SN2 reaction with an
     alcohol, it's necessary to convert the -OH into a better leaving group. This, in fact, is just what happens when

     a primary or secondary alcohol is converted into either an alkyl chloride by reaction with SOCl2 or an alkyl
     bromide by reaction with PBr3 (Section 10.5).

     Alternatively, an alcohol can be made more reactive toward nucleophilic substitution by treating it with
     para-toluenesulfonyl chloride to form a tosylate. As noted previously, tosylates are even more reactive than
     halides in nucleophilic substitutions. Note that tosylate formation does not change the configuration of the
     oxygen-bearing carbon because the C-O bond is not broken.

     The one general exception to the rule that ethers don't typically undergo SN2 reactions pertains to epoxides, the
     three-membered cyclic ethers that we saw in Section 8.7. Because of the angle strain in their three-membered
     ring, epoxides are much more reactive than other ethers. They react with aqueous acid to give 1,2-diols, as we
     saw in Section 8.7, and they react readily with many other nucleophiles as well. Propene oxide, for instance,
     reacts with HCl to give 1-chloro-2-propanol by an SN2 backside attack on the less hindered primary carbon
     atom. We'll look at the process in more detail in Section 18.5.

The Solvent

The rates of SN2 reactions are strongly affected by the solvent. Protic solvents--those that contain an -OH or
-NH group--are generally the worst for SN2 reactions, while polar aprotic solvents, which are polar but don't
have an -OH or -NH group, are the best.

Protic solvents, such as methanol and ethanol, slow down SN2 reactions by solvation of the reactant
nucleophile. The solvent molecules hydrogen-bond to the nucleophile and form a cage around it, thereby
lowering its energy and reactivity.

In contrast with protic solvents--which decrease the rates of SN2 reactions by lowering the ground-state energy
of the nucleophile--polar aprotic solvents increase the rates of SN2 reactions by raising the ground-state energy
of the nucleophile. Acetonitrile (CH3CN), dimethylformamide [(CH3)2NCHO, abbreviated DMF], and dimethyl
sulfoxide [(CH3)2SO, abbreviated DMSO] are particularly useful. A solvent known as hexamethylphosphoramide
{[(CH3)2N]3PO, abbreviated HMPA} can also be useful but it should only be handled with great care and not be
allowed to touch the eyes or skin. These solvents can dissolve many salts because of their high polarity, but

they tend to solvate metal cations rather than nucleophilic anions. As a result, the bare, unsolvated anions have

a greater nucleophilicity and SN2 reactions take place at correspondingly increased rates. For instance, a rate
increase of 200,000 has been observed on changing from methanol to HMPA for the reaction of azide ion with

1-bromobutane.

A Summary of SN2 Reaction Characteristics

The effects on SN2 reactions of the four variables--substrate structure, nucleophile, leaving group, and
solvent--are summarized in the following statements and in the energy diagrams of FIGURE 11.8:

Substrate    Steric hindrance raises the energy of the SN2 transition state, increasing G and
Nucleophile  decreasing the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.8a). As a result, SN2 reactions are best for methyl
             and primary substrates. Secondary substrates react slowly, and tertiary substrates do not

             react by an SN2 mechanism.

             Basic, negatively charged nucleophiles are less stable and have a higher ground-state
             energy than neutral ones, decreasing G and increasing the SN2 reaction rate (FIGURE
             11.8b).

              Protic solvents solvate the nucleophile, thereby lowering its ground-state energy,

              accompanying cation but not the nucleophilic anion, thereby raising the ground-state
              energy of the nucleophile, decreasing G, and increasing the reaction rate (FIGURE

              11.8d).

     FIGURE 11.8 Energy diagrams showing the effects of (a) substrate, (b) nucleophile, (c) leaving group, and (d) solvent on SN2 reaction
     rates. Substrate and leaving group effects are felt primarily in the transition state. Nucleophile and solvent effects are felt primarily in the
     reactant ground state.

     11.4 The SN1 Reaction

     Most nucleophilic substitutions take place by the SN2 pathway just discussed. The reaction is favored when
     carried out with an unhindered substrate and a negatively charged nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, but is
     disfavored when carried out with a hindered substrate and a neutral nucleophile in a protic solvent. You might
     therefore expect the reaction of a tertiary substrate (hindered) with water (neutral, protic) to be among the
     slowest of substitution reactions. Remarkably, however, the opposite is true. The reaction of the tertiary halide
     2-bromo-2-methylpropane (CH3)3CBr with H2O to give the alcohol 2-methyl-2-propanol is more than 1 million
     times faster than the corresponding reaction of CH3Br to give methanol.

     What's going on here? A nucleophilic substitution reaction is occurring--a hydroxyl group is replacing a
     halogen--yet the reactivity order seems backward. These reactions can't be taking place by the SN2 mechanism
     we've been discussing, so we must therefore conclude that they are occurring by an alternative substitution

11.4 · The SN1 Reaction                                                                                              351

mechanism. This alternative mechanism is called the SN1 reaction, for substitution, nucleophilic,
unimolecular.

In contrast to the SN2 reaction of CH3Br with OH-, the SN1 reaction of (CH3)3CBr with H2O has a rate that
depends only on the alkyl halide concentration and is independent of the H2O concentration. In other words,
the process is a first-order reaction; the concentration of the nucleophile does not appear in the rate equation.

To explain this result, we need to know more about kinetics measurements. Many organic reactions occur in
several steps, one of which usually has a higher-energy transition state than the others and is therefore slower.
We call this step with the highest transition-state energy the rate-limiting step, or rate-determining step. No
reaction can proceed faster than its rate-limiting step, which acts as a kind of traffic jam, or bottleneck. In the
SN1 reaction of (CH3)3CBr with H2O, the fact that the nucleophile concentration does not appear in the first-
order rate equation means that it is not involved in the rate-limiting step and must therefore be involved in
some other, non-rate-limiting step. The mechanism shown in FIGURE 11.9 accounts for these observations.

                      FIGURE 11.9 MECHANISM

                      The mechanism of the SN1 reaction of 2-bromo-2-methylpropane with H2O
                      involves three steps. Step 1--the spontaneous, unimolecular dissociation of the
                      alkyl bromide to yield a carbocation--is rate-limiting.

Unlike what occurs in an SN2 reaction, where the leaving group is displaced while the incoming nucleophile
approaches, an SN1 reaction takes place by loss of the leaving group before the nucleophile approaches.
2-Bromo-2-methylpropane spontaneously dissociates to the tert-butyl carbocation (CH3)3C+, plus Br- in a slow,
rate-limiting step, and the intermediate carbocation is then immediately trapped by the nucleophile water in
352  11 · Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations

     a faster second step. Thus, water is not a reactant in the step whose rate is measured. The energy diagram is
     shown in FIGURE 11.10.

     FIGURE 11.10 An energy diagram for an SN1 reaction. The rate-limiting step is the spontaneous dissociation of the alkyl halide to give a
     carbocation intermediate. Reaction of the carbocation with a nucleophile then occurs in a second, faster step.

     Because an SN1 reaction occurs through a carbocation intermediate, its stereochemical outcome is different
     from that of an SN2 reaction. Carbocations, as we've seen, are planar, sp2-hybridized, and achiral. Thus, if
     we carry out an SN1 reaction on one enantiomer of a chiral reactant and go through an achiral carbocation
     intermediate, the product loses its optical activity (Section 8.12). That is, the symmetrical intermediate
     carbocation can react with a nucleophile equally well from either side, leading to a racemic, 50 : 50 mixture of
     enantiomers (FIGURE 11.11).

     FIGURE 11.11 Stereochemistry of the SN1 reaction. Because the reaction goes through an achiral intermediate, an enantiomerically pure
     reactant gives an optically inactive racemic product.

     The conclusion that SN1 reactions on enantiomerically pure substrates should give racemic products is nearly,
     but not exactly, what is found. In fact, few SN1 displacements occur with complete racemization. Most give a
     minor (0-20%) excess of inversion. The reaction of (R)-6-chloro-2,6-dimethyloctane with H2O, for example,
     leads to an alcohol product that is approximately 80% racemized and 20% inverted (80% R,S + 20% S is
     equivalent to 40% R + 60% S).

This lack of complete racemization in SN1 reactions is due to the fact that ion pairs are involved. According
to this explanation, first proposed by Saul Winstein at UCLA, dissociation of the substrate occurs to give a
structure in which the two ions are still loosely associated and in which the carbocation is effectively shielded
from reaction on one side by the departing anion. If a certain amount of substitution occurs before the two ions
fully diffuse apart, then a net inversion of configuration will be observed (FIGURE 11.12).

FIGURE 11.12 Ion pairs in an SN1 reaction. The leaving group shields one side of the carbocation intermediate from reaction with the
nucleophile, thereby leading to some inversion of configuration rather than complete racemization.

     11.5 Characteristics of the SN1 Reaction

     Just as the SN2 reaction is strongly influenced by the structure of the substrate, the leaving group, the
     nucleophile, and the solvent, the SN1 reaction is similarly influenced. Factors that lower G, either by lowering
     the energy level of the transition state or by raising the energy level of the ground state, favor faster SN1
     reactions. Conversely, factors that raise G, either by raising the energy level of the transition state or by
     lowering the energy level of the reactant, slow down the SN1 reaction.

     The Substrate

     According to the Hammond postulate (Section 7.10), any factor that stabilizes a high-energy intermediate also
     stabilizes the transition state leading to that intermediate. Because the rate-limiting step in an SN1 reaction
     is the spontaneous, unimolecular dissociation of the substrate to yield a carbocation, the reaction is favored
     whenever a stabilized carbocation intermediate is formed. The more stable the carbocation intermediate, the
     faster the SN1 reaction.

     We saw in Section 7.9 that the stability order of alkyl carbocations is 3° > 2° > 1° > methyl. To this list we
     should also add the resonance-stabilized allyl and benzyl cations. Just as allylic radicals are unusually stable
     because the unpaired electron can be delocalized over an extended  orbital system (Section 10.4), so allylic and
     benzylic carbocations are unusually stable. (The word benzylic means "next to an aromatic ring.") As FIGURE
     11.13 indicates, an allylic cation has two resonance forms. In one form, the double bond is on the "left"; in the
     other form it's on the "right." A benzylic cation has five resonance forms, all of which contribute to the overall
     resonance hybrid.

     FIGURE 11.13 Resonance forms of allylic and benzylic carbocations. The positive charge is delocalized over the  system in both.
     Electron-poor atoms are indicated by blue arrows.

     Because of resonance stabilization, a primary allylic or benzylic carbocation is about as stable as a secondary

alkyl carbocation, and a secondary allylic or benzylic carbocation is about as stable as a tertiary alkyl
carbocation. This stability order of carbocations is the same as the order of SN1 reactivity for alkyl halides and
tosylates.

We should also note parenthetically that primary allylic and benzylic substrates are particularly reactive in SN2
reactions as well as in SN1 reactions. Allylic and benzylic C-X bonds are about 50 kJ/mol (12 kcal/mol) weaker
than the corresponding saturated bonds and are therefore more easily broken.

The Leaving Group

We said during the discussion of SN2 reactivity that the best leaving groups are those that are most stable; that
is, those that are the conjugate bases of strong acids. An identical reactivity order is found for the SN1 reaction
because the leaving group is directly involved in the rate-limiting step. Thus, the SN1 reactivity order is

Note that in the SN1 reaction, which is often carried out under acidic conditions, neutral water is sometimes
the leaving group. This occurs, for example, when an alkyl halide is prepared from a tertiary alcohol by reaction
with HBr or HCl (Section 10.5). As shown in FIGURE 11.14, the alcohol is first protonated and then
spontaneously loses H2O to generate a carbocation, which reacts with halide ion to give the alkyl halide.
Knowing that an SN1 reaction is involved in the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides explains why the
reaction works well only for tertiary alcohols. Tertiary alcohols react fastest because they give the most stable
carbocation intermediates.

     The mechanism of the SN1 reaction of a tertiary alcohol with HBr to yield an
     alkyl halide. Neutral water is the leaving group (step 2).

     The Nucleophile

     The nature of the nucleophile plays a major role in the SN2 reaction but does not affect an SN1 reaction. Because
     the SN1 reaction occurs through a rate-limiting step in which the added nucleophile has no part, the nucleophile
     can't affect the reaction rate. The reaction of 2-methyl-2-propanol with HX, for instance, occurs at the same
     rate regardless of whether X is Cl, Br, or I. Furthermore, neutral nucleophiles are just as effective as negatively
     charged ones, so SN1 reactions frequently occur under neutral or acidic conditions.

     The Solvent

     What about the solvent? Do solvents have the same effect in SN1 reactions that they have in SN2 reactions?
     The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on SN1 reactions, but no, the reasons for
     the effects on SN1 and SN2 reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the SN2 reaction are due largely to
     stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the SN1 reaction are due
     largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.
     The Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate
     of an SN1 reaction. Solvation of the carbocation--the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules--has such an

effect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face
the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.

FIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively
charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.

The properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's
polarity. SN1 reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol,
than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for
example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The
rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.

It should be emphasized again that both the SN1 and the SN2 reaction show solvent effects, but that they do
so for different reasons. SN2 reactions are disfavored in protic solvents because the ground-state energy of the
nucleophile is lowered by solvation. SN1 reactions are favored in protic solvents because the transition-state
energy leading to carbocation intermediate is lowered by solvation.

A Summary of SN1 Reaction Characteristics

The effects on SN1 reactions of the four variables--substrate, leaving group, nucleophile, and solvent--are
summarized in the following statements:

Leaving
group        Good leaving groups increase the reaction rate by lowering the energy level of the

Solvent      11.7), but otherwise does not affect the reaction rate. Neutral nucleophiles work well.

     of Section 11.3 and Section 11.5 whether an SN1 or an SN2 reaction is favored. SN1 reactions are favored by
     tertiary, allylic, or benzylic substrates, by good leaving groups, by nonbasic nucleophiles, and by protic solvents.

     11.6 Biological Substitution Reactions

     Both SN1 and SN2 reactions are common in biological chemistry, particularly in the pathways for biosynthesis
     of the many thousands of plant-derived substances called terpenoids, which we saw briefly in the Chapter 8
     Chemistry Matters and will discuss in Section 27.5. Unlike what typically happens in the laboratory, however,
     the substrate in a biological substitution reaction is usually an organodiphosphate rather than an alkyl halide.
     Thus, the leaving group is the diphosphate ion, abbreviated PPi, rather than a halide ion. In fact, it's useful
     to think of the diphosphate group as the "biological equivalent" of a halide. The dissociation of an
     organodiphosphate in a biological reaction is typically assisted by complexation to a divalent metal cation such
     as Mg2+ to help neutralize charge and make the diphosphate a better leaving group.

As an example, two SN1 reactions occur during the biosynthesis of geraniol, a fragrant alcohol found in roses
and used in perfumery. Geraniol biosynthesis begins with dissociation of dimethylallyl diphosphate to give
an allylic carbocation, which reacts with isopentenyl diphosphate (FIGURE 11.16). From the viewpoint of
isopentenyl diphosphate, the reaction is an electrophilic alkene addition, but from the viewpoint of
dimethylallyl diphosphate, the process is an SN1 reaction in which the carbocation intermediate reacts with a
double bond as the nucleophile.

FIGURE 11.16 Biosynthesis of geraniol from dimethylallyl diphosphate. Two SN1 reactions occur, both with diphosphate ion as the leaving
group.

Following this initial SN1 reaction, loss of the pro-R hydrogen gives geranyl diphosphate, itself an allylic
diphosphate that dissociates a second time. Reaction of the geranyl carbocation with water in a second SN1
reaction, followed by loss of a proton, then yields geraniol.

As another example, SN2 reactions are involved in almost all biological methylations, which transfer a -CH3
group from an electrophilic donor to a nucleophile. The donor is S-adenosylmethionine (abbreviated SAM),
which contains a positively charged sulfur (a sulfonium ion, Section 5.12), and the leaving group is the neutral
S-adenosylhomocysteine molecule. In the biosynthesis of epinephrine (adrenaline) from norepinephrine, for

     instance, the nucleophilic nitrogen atom of norepinephrine attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon atom of
     S-adenosylmethionine in an SN2 reaction, displacing S-adenosylhomocysteine (FIGURE 11.17). In effect,
     S-adenosylmethionine is simply a biological equivalent of CH3Cl.

     11.7 Elimination Reactions: Zaitsev's Rule

     We said at the beginning of this chapter that two kinds of reactions can take place when a nucleophile/Lewis
     base reacts with an alkyl halide. The nucleophile can either substitute for the halide by reaction at carbon or
     can cause elimination of HX by reaction at a neighboring hydrogen:

     Elimination reactions are more complex than substitution reactions for several reasons. One is the problem
     of regiochemistry. What product results by loss of HX from an unsymmetrical halide? In fact, elimination
     reactions almost always give mixtures of alkene products, and the best we can usually do is to predict which will
     be the major product.
     According to Zaitsev's rule, formulated in 1875 by the Russian chemist Alexander Zaitsev, base-induced
     elimination reactions generally (although not always) give the more stable alkene product--that is, the alkene
     with more alkyl substituents on the double-bond carbons. In the following two cases, for example, the more
     highly substituted alkene product predominates.

ZAITSEV'S RULE
In the elimination of HX from an alkyl halide, the more highly substituted alkene product predominates.

Another factor that complicates a study of elimination reactions is that they can take place by different
mechanisms, just as substitutions can. We'll consider three of the most common mechanisms--the E1, E2, and
E1cB reactions--which differ in the timing of C-H and C-X bond-breaking.

In the E1 reaction, the C-X bond breaks first to give a carbocation intermediate, which undergoes subsequent
base abstraction of H+ to yield the alkene. In the E2 reaction, base-induced C-H bond cleavage is simultaneous
with C-X bond cleavage, giving the alkene in a single step. In the E1cB reaction (cB for "conjugate base"), base
abstraction of the proton occurs first, giving a carbanion (R:-) intermediate. This anion, the conjugate base of
the reactant "acid," then undergoes loss of X- in a subsequent step to give the alkene. All three mechanisms
occur frequently in the laboratory, but the E1cB mechanism predominates in biological pathways.

     11.8 The E2 Reaction and the Deuterium Isotope Effect

     The E2 reaction (for elimination, bimolecular) occurs when an alkyl halide is treated with a strong base, such
     as hydroxide ion or alkoxide ion (RO-). It is the most commonly occurring pathway for elimination and can be
     formulated as shown in FIGURE 11.18.

FIGURE 11.18 MECHANISM

Mechanism of the E2 reaction of an alkyl halide. The reaction takes place in a
single step through a transition state in which the double bond begins to form at the
same time the H and X groups are leaving.

Like the SN2 reaction, the E2 reaction takes place in one step without intermediates. As the base begins to
abstract H+ from a carbon next to the leaving group, the C-H bond begins to break, a
                                                                                      bond begins to form,

and the leaving group begins to depart, taking with it the electron pair from the C-X bond. Among the pieces

of evidence supporting this mechanism is the fact that E2 reactions show second-order kinetics and follow the

rate law: rate = k × [RX] × [Base]. That is, both the base and alkyl halide take part in the rate-limiting step.

A second piece of evidence in support of the E2 mechanism is provided by a phenomenon known as the
deuterium isotope effect. For reasons that we won't go into, a carbon-hydrogen bond is weaker by about
5 kJ/mol (1.2 kcal/mol) than the corresponding carbon-deuterium bond. Thus, a C-H bond is more easily
broken than an equivalent C-D bond, and the rate of C-H bond cleavage is faster. For instance, the base-
induced elimination of HBr from 1-bromo-2-phenylethane proceeds 7.11 times faster than the corresponding
elimination of DBr from 1-bromo-2, 2-dideuterio-2-phenylethane. This result tells us that the C-H (or C-D)
bond is broken in the rate-limiting step, consistent with our picture of the E2 reaction as a one-step process. If
it were otherwise, we wouldn't observe a rate difference.

Yet a third piece of mechanistic evidence involves the stereochemistry of E2 eliminations. As shown by a
large number of experiments, E2 reactions occur with periplanar geometry, meaning that all four reacting
atoms--the hydrogen, the two carbons, and the leaving group--lie in the same plane. Two such geometries are
possible: syn periplanar geometry, in which the H and the X are on the same side of the molecule, and anti
periplanar geometry, in which the H and the X are on opposite sides of the molecule. Of the two, anti periplanar
geometry is energetically preferred because it allows the substituents on the two carbons to adopt a staggered
relationship, whereas syn geometry requires that the substituents be eclipsed.
364  11 · Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations

     What's so special about periplanar geometry? Because the sp3  orbitals in the reactant C-H and C-X bonds
     must overlap and become p  orbitals in the alkene product, there must also be some overlap in the transition
     state. This can occur most easily if all the orbitals are in the same plane to begin with--that is, if they're
     periplanar (FIGURE 11.19).

     FIGURE 11.19 The transition state for the E2 reaction of an alkyl halide with base. Overlap of the developing p orbitals in the transition
     state requires periplanar geometry of the reactant.

     You can think of E2 elimination reactions with periplanar geometry as being similar to SN2 reactions with 180°
     geometry. In an SN2 reaction, an electron pair from the incoming nucleophile pushes out the leaving group on
     the opposite side of the molecule. In an E2 reaction, an electron pair from a neighboring C-H bond also pushes
     out the leaving group on the opposite side of the molecule.

     Anti periplanar geometry for E2 eliminations has specific stereochemical consequences that provide strong
     evidence for the proposed mechanism. To take just one example, meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
     undergoes E2 elimination on treatment with base to give only the E alkene. None of the isomeric Z alkene is
     formed because the transition state leading to the Z alkene would have to have syn periplanar geometry and

11.9 The E2 Reaction and Cyclohexane Conformation

Anti periplanar geometry for E2 reactions is particularly important in cyclohexane rings, where chair geometry
forces a rigid relationship between the substituents on neighboring carbon atoms (Section 4.8). The anti
periplanar requirement for E2 reactions overrides Zaitsev's rule and can be met in cyclohexanes only if the
hydrogen and the leaving group are trans diaxial (FIGURE 11.20). If either the leaving group or the hydrogen is
366  11 · Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations

     equatorial, E2 elimination can't occur.

     FIGURE 11.20 The geometric requirement for an E2 reaction in a substituted cyclohexane. The leaving group and the hydrogen must
     both be axial for anti periplanar elimination to occur.

     The elimination of HCl from the isomeric menthyl and neomenthyl chlorides shown in FIGURE 11.21 gives
     a good illustration of this trans-diaxial requirement. Neomenthyl chloride undergoes elimination of HCl on
     reaction with ethoxide ion 200 times faster than menthyl chloride. Furthermore, neomenthyl chloride yields
     3-menthene as the major alkene product, whereas menthyl chloride yields 2-menthene.

     FIGURE 11.21 Dehydrochlorination of menthyl and neomenthyl chlorides. (a) Neomenthyl chloride loses HCl directly from its more stable
     conformation, but (b) menthyl chloride must first ring-flip to a higher energy conformation before HCl loss can occur. The abbreviation "Et"
     represents an ethyl group.

     The difference in reactivity between the isomeric menthyl chlorides is due to the difference in their
     conformations. Neomenthyl chloride has the conformation shown in FIGURE 11.21a, with the methyl and
     isopropyl groups equatorial and the chlorine axial--a perfect geometry for E2 elimination. Loss of the hydrogen
     atom at C4 occurs easily to yield the more substituted alkene product, 3-menthene, as predicted by Zaitsev's
     rule.

     Menthyl chloride, by contrast, has a conformation in which all three substituents are equatorial (FIGURE
     11.21b). To achieve the necessary geometry for elimination, menthyl chloride must first ring-flip to a higher-
     energy chair conformation, in which all three substituents are axial. E2 elimination then occurs with loss of

11.10 The E1 and E1cB Reactions

The E1 Reaction

Just as the E2 reaction is analogous to the SN2 reaction, the SN1 reaction has a close analog called the E1
reaction (for elimination, unimolecular). The E1 reaction can be formulated as shown in FIGURE 11.22, with
the elimination of HCl from 2-chloro-2-methylpropane.

                      FIGURE 11.22 MECHANISM

                      Mechanism of the E1 reaction. Two steps are involved, the first of which is rate-
                      limiting, and a carbocation intermediate is present.

E1 eliminations begin with the same unimolecular dissociation to give a carbocation that we saw in the SN1
reaction, but the dissociation is followed by loss of H+ from the adjacent carbon rather than by substitution. In
fact, the E1 and SN1 reactions normally occur together whenever an alkyl halide is treated in a protic solvent
with a nonbasic nucleophile. Thus, the best E1 substrates are also the best SN1 substrates, and mixtures of
substitution and elimination products are usually obtained. For example, when 2-chloro-2-methylpropane is
warmed to 65 °C in 80% aqueous ethanol, a 64 : 36 mixture of 2-methyl-2-propanol (SN1) and 2-methylpropene
(E1) results.

Much evidence has been obtained in support of the E1 mechanism. For example, E1 reactions show first-order
kinetics, consistent with a rate-limiting, unimolecular dissociation process. Furthermore, E1 reactions show no
368  11 · Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations

     deuterium isotope effect because rupture of the C-H (or C-D) bond occurs after the rate-limiting step rather
     than during it. Thus, we can't measure a rate difference between a deuterated and nondeuterated substrate.

     A final piece of evidence involves the stereochemistry of elimination. Unlike the E2 reaction, where anti
     periplanar geometry is required, there is no geometric requirement on the E1 reaction because the halide and
     the hydrogen are lost in separate steps. We might therefore expect to obtain the more stable (Zaitsev's rule)
     product from E1 reaction, which is just what we find. To return to a familiar example, menthyl chloride loses HCl
     under E1 conditions in a polar solvent to give a mixture of alkenes in which the Zaitsev product, 3-menthene,
     predominates (FIGURE 11.23).

     FIGURE 11.23 Elimination reactions of menthyl chloride. E2 conditions (1, strong base in 100% ethanol) lead to 2-menthene through
     an anti periplanar elimination, whereas E1 conditions (2, dilute base in 80% aqueous ethanol) lead to a mixture of 2-menthene and
     3-menthene.

     The E1cB Reaction

     In contrast to the E1 reaction, which involves a carbocation intermediate, the E1cB reaction takes place

     through a carbanion intermediate. Base-induced abstraction of a proton in a slow, rate-limiting step gives an

     anion, which expels a leaving group on the adjacent carbon. The reaction is particularly common in substrates

     that have a poor leaving group, such as -OH, two carbons removed from a carbonyl group, as in  .

     The poor leaving group disfavors the alternative E1 and E2 possibilities, and the carbonyl group makes the

     adjacent hydrogen unusually acidic by resonance stabilization of the anion intermediate. We'll look at this

     acidifying effect of a carbonyl group in Section 22.5.

     11.11 Biological Elimination Reactions

     All three elimination reactions--E2, E1, and E1cB--occur in biological pathways, but the E1cB mechanism is
     particularly common. The substrate is usually an alcohol rather than an alkyl halide, and the H atom removed is
     usually adjacent to a carbonyl group, just as in laboratory reactions. Thus, 3-hydroxy carbonyl compounds are
     frequently converted to unsaturated carbonyl compounds by elimination reactions. A typical example occurs
     during the biosynthesis of fats and oils when a 3-hydroxybutyryl thioester is dehydrated to the corresponding
     unsaturated (crotonyl) thioester. The base in this reaction is a histidine amino acid in the enzyme, and the loss
     of the -OH group is assisted by simultaneous protonation.

     CHEMISTRY MATTERS

Green Chemistry

Organic chemistry in the 20th century changed the world, giving us new medicines, food preservatives,
insecticides, adhesives, textiles, dyes, building materials, composites, and all manner of polymers. But these
advances did not come without a cost: Almost every chemical process produces waste that must be dealt
with, including reaction solvents and toxic by-products that might evaporate into the air or be leached into
groundwater if not disposed of properly. Even apparently harmless by-products must be safely buried or
otherwise sequestered. As always, there's no such thing as a free lunch. With the good also comes the bad.

It may never be possible to make organic chemistry completely benign, but awareness of the environmental
problems caused by many chemical processes has grown dramatically in recent years, giving rise to a
movement called green chemistry. Green chemistry is the design and implementation of chemical products
and processes that reduce waste and attempt to eliminate the generation of hazardous substances. There are 12
principles of green chemistry:

      Prevent waste - Waste should be prevented rather than treated or cleaned up after it has been created.
      Maximize atom economy - Synthetic methods should maximize the incorporation of all materials used in
      a process into the final product so that waste is minimized.
      Use less hazardous processes - Synthetic methods should use reactants and generate wastes with
      minimal toxicity to health and the environment.
      Design safer chemicals - Chemical products should be designed to have minimal toxicity.
      Use safer solvents - Minimal use should be made of solvents, separation agents, and other auxiliary
      substances in a reaction.
      Design for energy efficiency - Energy requirements for chemical processes should be minimized, with
      reactions carried out at room temperature if possible.
      Use renewable feedstocks - Raw materials should come from renewable sources when feasible.
      Minimize derivatives - Syntheses should be designed with minimal use of protecting groups to avoid extra
      steps and reduce waste.
      Use catalysis - Reactions should be catalytic rather than stoichiometric.
      Design for degradation - Products should be designed to be biodegradable at the end of their useful
      lifetimes.
      Monitor pollution in real time - Processes should be monitored in real time for the formation of hazardous
      substances.
      Prevent accidents - Chemical substances and processes should minimize the potential for fires,
      explosions, or other accidents.

The foregoing 12 principles may not all be met in most real-world applications, but they provide a worthy goal
and they can make chemists think more carefully about the environmental implications of their work. Real
success stories have occurred, and more are in progress. Approximately 7 million pounds per year of ibuprofen
(6 billion tablets!) are now made by a "green" process that produces approximately 99% less waste than the
process it replaces. Only three steps are needed, the anhydrous HF solvent used in the first step is recovered
and reused, and the second and third steps are catalytic.

Summary

The reaction of an alkyl halide or tosylate with a nucleophile/base results either in substitution or in
elimination. The resultant nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination reactions are two of the most
widely occurring and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological
pathways.

Nucleophilic substitutions are of two types: SN2 reactions and SN1 reactions. In the SN2 reaction, the entering
nucleophile approaches the halide from a direction 180° away from the leaving group, resulting in an umbrella-
like inversion of configuration at the carbon atom. The reaction is kinetically second-order and is strongly
inhibited by increasing steric bulk of the reactants. Thus, SN2 reactions are favored for primary and secondary
substrates.

In the SN1 reaction, the substrate spontaneously dissociates to a carbocation in a slow rate-limiting step,
followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile. As a result, SN1 reactions are kinetically first-order and take
place with substantial racemization of configuration at the carbon atom. They are most favored for tertiary

substrates. Both SN1 and SN2 reactions occur in biological pathways, although the leaving group is typically a
diphosphate ion rather than a halide.

Eliminations of alkyl halides to yield alkenes occur by three mechanisms: E2 reactions, E1 reactions, and E1cB
reactions, which differ in the timing of C-H and C-X bond-breaking. In the E2 reaction, C-H and C-X bond-
breaking occur simultaneously when a base abstracts H+ from one carbon while the leaving group departs
from the neighboring carbon. The reaction takes place preferentially through an anti periplanar transition
state in which the four reacting atoms--hydrogen, two carbons, and leaving group--are in the same plane.
The reaction shows second-order kinetics and a deuterium isotope effect, and occurs when a secondary or
tertiary substrate is treated with a strong base. These elimination reactions usually give a mixture of alkene
products in which the more highly substituted alkene predominates (Zaitsev's rule).

In the E1 reaction, C-X bond-breaking occurs first. The substrate dissociates to yield a carbocation in the

slow rate-limiting step before losing H+ from an adjacent carbon in a second step. The reaction shows first-
order kinetics and no deuterium isotope effect and occurs when a tertiary substrate reacts in polar, nonbasic
solution.
In the E1cB reaction, C-H bond-breaking occurs first. A base abstracts a proton to give a carbanion, followed by
loss of the leaving group from the adjacent carbon in a second step. The reaction is favored when the leaving
group is two carbons removed from a carbonyl, which stabilizes the intermediate anion by resonance. Biological
elimination reactions typically occur by this E1cB mechanism.
In general, substrates react in the following way:

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Finding the structures of new molecules, whether small ones synthesized in the
laboratory or large proteins and nucleic acids found in living organisms, is central to progress in chemistry and
biochemistry. We can only scratch the surface of structure determination in this book, but after reading this and
the following two chapters, you should have a good idea of the range of structural techniques available and of
how and when each is used.
Every time a reaction is run, the products must be identified, and every time a new compound is found in
nature, its structure must be determined. Determining the structure of an organic compound was a difficult
and time-consuming process until the mid-20th century, but powerful techniques and specialized instruments
are now routinely used to simplify the problem. In this and the next two chapters, we'll look at four such
techniques--mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)--and we'll see the kind of information that can be obtained from each.

     12.1 Mass Spectrometry of Small Molecules: Magnetic-Sector Instruments

     At its simplest, mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique for measuring the mass, and therefore the molecular
     weight (MW), of a molecule. In addition, it's often possible to gain structural information about a molecule by
     measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart.

     More than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended
     application, but all have three basic parts: an ionization source in which sample molecules are given an
     electrical charge, a mass analyzer in which ions are separated by their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector in
     which the separated ions are observed and counted.

     Among the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electron-
     impact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically in FIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is
     vaporized into the ionization source, where it is bombarded by a stream of high-energy electrons. The energy of
     the electron beam can be varied but is commonly around 70 electron volts (eV), or 6700 kJ/mol. When a high-
     energy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a
     cation radical--cation because the molecule has lost an electron and now has a positive charge; radical because
     the molecule now has an odd number of electrons.

     Electron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation.
     They break apart into smaller pieces, some of which retain the positive charge and some of which are neutral.
     The fragments then flow through a curved pipe in a strong magnetic field, which deflects them into different
     paths according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Neutral fragments are not deflected by the magnetic field
     and are lost on the walls of the pipe, but positively charged fragments are sorted by the mass spectrometer onto
     a detector, which records them as peaks at the various m/z ratios. Since the number of charges z on each ion
     is usually 1, the value of m/z for each ion is simply its mass m. Masses up to approximately 2500 atomic mass
     units (amu) can be analyzed by this type of instrument.

according to their mass.

Another common type of mass spectrometer uses what is called a quadrupole mass analyzer, which has a
set of four solid rods is arranged parallel to the direction of the ion beam, with an oscillating electrostatic
field is generated in the space between the rods. For a given field, only one m/z value will make it through
the quadrupole region. The others will crash into the rods or the walls of the instrument and never reach the
detector FIGURE 12.3.

FIGURE 12.3 Representation of a quadrupole mass analyzer. Only ions of a certain m/z will reach the detector; other ions will collide with
the rods.

The mass spectrum of a compound is typically presented as a bar graph, with masses (m/z values) on the x axis
and intensity, or relative abundance of ions of a given m/z striking the detector, on the y axis. The tallest peak,
assigned an intensity of 100%, is called the base peak, and the peak that corresponds to the unfragmented
cation radical is called the parent peak, or the molecular ion (M+, or simply M). FIGURE 12.4 shows the mass
spectrum of propane.

     Mass spectral fragmentation patterns are usually complex, and the molecular ion is often not the base peak. The
     mass spectrum of propane in FIGURE 12.4, for instance, shows a molecular ion at m/z = 44 that is only about
     30% as high as the base peak at m/z = 29. In addition, many other fragment ions are present.

     12.2 Interpreting Mass Spectra

     What kinds of information can we get from a mass spectrum? The most obvious information is the molecular
     weight of the sample, which in itself can be invaluable. If we were given samples of hexane (MW = 86), 1-hexene
     (MW = 84), and 1-hexyne (MW = 82), for example, mass spectrometry would easily distinguish them.
     Some instruments, called double-focusing mass spectrometers, have two magnetic sectors in their mass
     analyzers, giving these spectrometers have such high resolution that they provide mass measurements
     accurate to 5 ppm, or about 0.0005 amu, making it possible to distinguish between two formulas with the same
     nominal mass. For example, both C5H12 and C4H8O have MW = 72, but they differ slightly beyond the decimal
     point: C5H12 has an exact mass of 72.0939 amu, whereas C4H8O has an exact mass of 72.0575 amu. A high-
     resolution instrument can easily distinguish between them. Note, however, that exact mass measurements refer
     to molecules with specific isotopic compositions. Thus, the sum of the exact atomic masses of the specific
     isotopes in a molecule is measured--1.007 83 amu for 1H, 12.000 00 amu for 12C, 14.003 07 amu for 14N, 15.994
     91 amu for 16O, and so on--rather than the sum of the average atomic masses of elements, as found on a periodic
     table.
     Unfortunately, not every compound shows a molecular ion in its electron-impact mass spectrum. Although M+
     is usually easy to identify if it's abundant, some compounds, such as 2,2-dimethylpropane, fragment so easily
     that no molecular ion is observed (FIGURE 12.5). In such cases, alternative "soft" ionization methods that don't
     use electron bombardment can prevent or minimize fragmentation (see Section 12.4).

     FIGURE 12.5 Mass spectrum of 2,2-dimethylpropane (C5H12; MW = 72). No molecular ion is observed when electron-impact ionization is
     used. What do you think is the formula and structure of the M+ peak at m/z = 57?

     Knowing the molecular weight makes it possible to narrow considerably the choices of molecular formula. For
     example, if the mass spectrum of an unknown compound shows a molecular ion at m/z = 110, the molecular
     formula is likely to be C8H14, C7H10O, C6H6O2, or C6H10N2. There are always a number of molecular formulas
     possible for all but the lowest molecular weights, and a computer can easily generate a list of the choices.

A further point about mass spectrometry, noticeable in the spectra of both propane (FIGURE 12.4) and
2,2-dimethylpropane (FIGURE 12.5), is that the peak for the molecular ion is not at the highest m/z value. There
is also a small peak at M + 1 due to the presence of different isotopes in the molecules. Although 12C is the most
abundant carbon isotope, a small amount (1.10% natural abundance) of 13C is also present. Thus, a certain
percentage of the molecules analyzed in the mass spectrometer are likely to contain a 13C atom, giving rise to
the observed M + 1 peak. In addition, a small amount of 2H (deuterium; 0.015% natural abundance) is present,
making a further contribution to the M + 1 peak.

Mass spectrometry would be useful even if molecular weight and formula were the only information that could
be obtained, but in fact it provides much more. For one thing, the mass spectrum of a compound serves as a
kind of "molecular fingerprint." Every organic compound fragments in a unique way depending on its structure,
and the likelihood of two compounds having identical mass spectra is small. Thus, it's sometimes possible
to identify an unknown by computer-based matching of its mass spectrum to one of the more than 785,061
searchable spectra recorded in a database called the Registry of Mass Spectral Data.

It's also possible to derive structural information about a molecule by interpreting its fragmentation pattern.
Fragmentation occurs when the high-energy cation radical flies apart by spontaneous cleavage of a chemical
bond. One of the two fragments retains the positive charge and is a carbocation, while the other fragment is a
neutral radical.

Not surprisingly, the positive charge often remains with the fragment that is best able to stabilize it. In other
words, a relatively stable carbocation is often formed during fragmentation. For example, 2,2-dimethylpropane
tends to fragment in such a way that the positive charge remains with the tert-butyl group.
2,2-Dimethylpropane therefore has a base peak at m/z = 57, corresponding to C4H9+ (FIGURE 12.5).

Because mass-spectral fragmentation patterns are usually complex, it's often difficult to assign structures to
fragment ions. Most hydrocarbons fragment in many ways, as demonstrated by the mass spectrum of hexane in
FIGURE 12.6. The hexane spectrum shows a moderately abundant molecular ion at m/z = 86 and fragment ions
at m/z = 71, 57, 43, and 29. Since all the carbon-carbon bonds of hexane are electronically similar, all break to
a similar extent, giving rise to the observed mixture of ions.

       FIGURE 12.6 Mass spectrum of hexane (C6H14; MW = 86). The base peak is at m/z = 57, and numerous other ions are present.

FIGURE 12.7 shows how the hexane fragments might arise. The loss of a methyl radical (CH3, M = 15) from the
hexane cation radical (M+ = 86) gives rise to a fragment of mass 86 - 15 = 71; the loss of an ethyl radical (C2H5,
M = 29) accounts for a fragment of mass 86 - 29 = 57; the loss of a propyl radical (C3H7, M = 43) accounts for a
fragment of mass 86 - 43 = 43; and the loss of a butyl radical accounts for a fragment of mass 29. With practice,
it's sometimes possible to analyze the fragmentation pattern of an unknown compound and work backward to
a structure that is compatible with the data.

     Using Mass Spectra to Identify Compounds

     Assume that you have two unlabeled samples, one of methylcyclohexane and the other of ethylcyclopentane.
     How could you use mass spectrometry to tell them apart? The mass spectra of both are shown in FIGURE 12.8.

     Strategy
     Look at the possible structures and decide on how they differ. Then think about how any of these differences
     in structure might give rise to differences in mass spectra. Methyl cyclohexane, for instance, has a -CH3 group,

and ethylcyclopentane has a -CH2CH3 group, which should affect the fragmentation patterns.

Solution
Both mass spectra show molecular ions at M+ = 98, corresponding to C7H14, but they differ in their
fragmentation patterns. Sample A has its base peak at m/z = 69, corresponding to the loss of a CH2CH3 group (29
mass units), but B has a rather small peak at m/z = 69. Sample B shows a base peak at m/z = 83, corresponding
to the loss of a CH3 group (15 mass units), but sample A has only a small peak at m/z = 83. We can therefore be
reasonably certain that A is ethylcyclopentane and B is methylcyclohexane.

12.3 Mass Spectrometry of Some Common Functional Groups

As each functional group is discussed in future chapters, mass-spectral fragmentations characteristic of that
group will be described. As a preview, though, we'll point out some distinguishing features of several common
functional groups.

Alcohols

Alcohols undergo fragmentation in a mass spectrometer by two pathways: alpha cleavage and dehydration.
In the -cleavage pathway, a C-C bond nearest the hydroxyl group is broken, yielding a neutral radical plus
a resonance-stabilized, oxygen-containing cation. This type of fragmentation is seen in the spectrum of
2-pentanol in FIGURE 12.10.
390  12 · Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy

                                                                    FIGURE 12.10 Mass spectrum of 2-pentanol.

     In the dehydration pathway, water is eliminated, yielding an alkene radical cation with a mass 18 amu less than
     M+. For simplicity, we have drawn the dehydration below as an E2-type process. Often the hydrogen that is lost is
     not beta to the hydroxyl. Only a small peak from dehydration is observed in the spectrum of 2-pentanol (FIGURE
     12.10).

     Amines

     The nitrogen rule of mass spectrometry says that a compound with an odd number of nitrogen atoms has an
     odd-numbered molecular weight. The logic behind the rule comes from the fact that nitrogen is trivalent, thus
     requiring an odd number of hydrogen atoms. The presence of nitrogen in a molecule is often detected simply by
     observing its mass spectrum. An odd-numbered molecular ion usually means that the unknown compound has
     one or three nitrogen atoms, and an even-numbered molecular ion usually means that a compound has either
     zero or two nitrogen atoms.
     Aliphatic amines undergo a characteristic  cleavage in a mass spectrometer, similar to that observed for
     alcohols. A C-C bond nearest the nitrogen atom is broken, yielding an alkyl radical and a resonance-stabilized,
     nitrogen-containing cation.

     The mass spectrum of triethylamine has a base peak at m/z = 86, which arises from an alpha cleavage resulting
     in the loss of a methyl group (FIGURE 12.11).

Halides

The fact that some elements have two common isotopes gives their mass spectra a distinctive appearance.
Chlorine, for example, exists as two isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, in roughly a 3 : 1 ratio. In a sample of chloroethane,
three out of four molecules contain a 35Cl atom and one out of four has a 37Cl atom. In the mass spectrum of
chloroethane (FIGURE 12.12 we see the molecular ion (M) at m/z = 64 for ions that contain a 35Cl and another
peak at m/z = 66, called the M + 2 peak, for ions containing a 37Cl. The ratio of the relative abundance of M : M +
2 is about 3 : 1, a reflection of the isotopic abundances of chlorine.

                                                             FIGURE 12.12 Mass spectrum of chloroethane.

In the case of bromine, the isotopic distribution is 50.7% 79Br and 49.3% 81Br. In the mass spectrum of
1-bromohexane (FIGURE 12.13) the molecular ion appears at m/z = 164 for 79Br-containing ions and the M + 2
peak is at m/z = 166 for 81Br-containing ions. The ions at m/z = 135 and 137 are informative as well. The two
nearly equally large peaks tell us that the ions at those m/z values still contain the bromine atom. The peak at
m/z = 85, on the other hand, does not contain bromine because there is not a large peak at m/z = 87.

     Carbonyl Compounds

     Ketones and aldehydes that have a hydrogen on a carbon three atoms away from the carbonyl group undergo a
     characteristic mass-spectral cleavage called the McLafferty rearrangement. The hydrogen atom is transferred
     to the carbonyl oxygen, a C-C bond between the alpha and beta carbons is broken, and a neutral alkene
     fragment is produced. The charge remains with the oxygen-containing fragment.

     In addition, ketones and aldehydes frequently undergo  cleavage of the bond between the carbonyl carbon and
     the neighboring carbon to yield a neutral radical and a resonance-stabilized acyl cation. Because the carbon
     neighboring the carbonyl carbon is called the alpha carbon, the reaction is called an alpha cleavage.

     (To be more general about neighboring positions in carbonyl compounds, Greek letters are used in alphabetical
     order: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and so on.)

     The mass spectrum of butyrophenone illustrates both alpha cleavage and the McLafferty rearrangement
     (FIGURE 12.14). Alpha cleavage of the propyl substituent results in the loss of C3H7 = 43 mass units from the
     parent ion at m/z = 148 to give the fragment ion at m/z = 105. A McLafferty rearrangement of butyrophenone
     results in the loss of ethylene, C2H4 = 28 mass units, from the parent leaving the ion at m/z = 120.

     12.4 Mass Spectrometry in Biological Chemistry: Time-of-Flight (TOF)
     Instruments

     MS analyses of sensitive biological samples rarely use magnetic sector ionization. Instead, they typically use
     either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), typically linked to
     a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Both ESI and MALDI are soft ionization methods that produce charged
     molecules with little fragmentation, even with sensitive biological samples of very high molecular weight.

     In an ESI source, as a sample solution exits the tube, it is subjected to a high voltage that causes the droplets

     to become charged. The sample molecules gain one or more protons from charged solvent molecules in the
     droplet. The volatile solvent quickly evaporates, giving variably protonated sample molecules (M + Hnn+). In a
     MALDI source, the sample is adsorbed onto a suitable matrix compound, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid,

     which is ionized by a short burst of laser light. The matrix compound then transfers the energy to the sample
     and protonates it, forming M + Hnn+ ions.

     Following ion formation, the variably protonated sample molecules are electrically focused into a small packet

     with a narrow spatial distribution, and the packet is given a sudden kick of energy by an accelerator electrode.
     As each molecule in the packet is given the same energy, E = mv2/2, it begins moving with a velocity that

     depends on the square root of its mass,  . Lighter molecules move faster, and heavier molecules

     move slower. The analyzer itself--the drift tube--is simply an electrically grounded metal tube inside which the

     different charged molecules become separated as they move at different velocities and take different amounts

     of time to complete their flight.

     The Time of Flight technique is considerably more sensitive than the magnetic sector alternative, and protein
     samples of up to 100 kilodaltons (100,000 amu) can be separated with a mass accuracy of 3 ppm. FIGURE

12.5 Spectroscopy and the Electromagnetic Spectrum

Infrared, ultraviolet, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies differ from mass spectrometry in that
they are nondestructive and involve the interaction of molecules with electromagnetic energy rather than with
an ionizing source. Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of
radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.
Visible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation.
Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic
spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion,
from 3.8 × 10-7 m to 7.8 × 10-7 m in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet
regions.

FIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the low-
frequency end to gamma () rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle
of the spectrum.

Electromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a
particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic
radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength,
 (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency,  (Greek nu), is the
396  12 · Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy

     number of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds (s-1), or hertz, Hz
     (1 Hz = 1 s-1). The amplitude is the height of a wave, measured from midpoint to peak. The intensity of radiant

     energy, whether a feeble glow or a blinding glare, is proportional to the square of the wave's amplitude.

     FIGURE 12.18 Electromagnetic waves are characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude. (a) Wavelength () is the
     distance between two successive wave maxima. Amplitude is the height of the wave measured from the center. (b)-(c) What we perceive as
     different kinds of electromagnetic radiation are simply waves with different wavelengths and frequencies.

     Multiplying the wavelength of a wave in meters (m) by its frequency in reciprocal seconds (s-1) gives the speed
     of the wave in meters per second (m/s). The rate of travel of all electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is a
     constant value, commonly called the "speed of light" and abbreviated c. Its numerical value is defined as exactly
     2.997 924 58 × 108 m/s, usually rounded off to 3.00 × 108 m/s.

     Just as matter comes only in discrete units called atoms, electromagnetic energy is transmitted only in discrete
     amounts called quanta. The amount of energy  corresponding to 1 quantum of energy (1 photon) of a given
     frequency  is expressed by the Planck equation

     where h = Planck's constant (6.62 × 10-34 J  s = 1.58 × 10-34 cal  s).
     The Planck equation says that the energy of a given photon varies directly with its frequency  but inversely
     with its wavelength . High frequencies and short wavelengths correspond to high-energy radiation such as
     gamma rays; low frequencies and long wavelengths correspond to low-energy radiation such as radio waves.
     Multiplying  by Avogadro's number NA gives the same equation in more familiar units, where E represents the
     energy of Avogadro's number (one "mole") of photons of wavelength :

     When an organic compound is exposed to a beam of electromagnetic radiation, it absorbs energy of some
     wavelengths but passes, or transmits, energy of other wavelengths. If we irradiate the sample with energy of
     many different wavelengths and determine which are absorbed and which are transmitted, we can measure the
     absorption spectrum of the compound.
     An example of an absorption spectrum--that of ethanol exposed to infrared radiation--is shown in FIGURE

12.19. The horizontal axis records the wavelength, and the vertical axis records the intensity of the various
energy absorptions in percent transmittance. The baseline corresponding to 0% absorption (or 100%
transmittance) runs along the top of the chart, so a downward spike means that energy absorption has occurred
at that wavelength.

FIGURE 12.19 An infrared absorption spectrum for ethanol, CH3CH2OH. A transmittance of 100% means that all the energy is passing
through the sample, whereas a lower transmittance means that some energy is being absorbed. Thus, each downward spike corresponds to
an energy absorption.

The energy a molecule gains when it absorbs radiation must be distributed over the molecule in some way.
With infrared radiation, the absorbed energy causes bonds to stretch and bend more vigorously. With ultraviolet
radiation, the energy causes an electron to jump from a lower-energy orbital to a higher-energy one. Different
radiation frequencies affect molecules in different ways, but each provides structural information when the
results are interpreted.

There are many kinds of spectroscopies, which differ according to the region of the electromagnetic spectrum
used. We'll look at three: infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. Let's begin by seeing what happens when an organic sample absorbs infrared energy.

Since visible light has a higher frequency than radio waves, it is higher in energy.

PROBLEM Which has higher energy, infrared radiation with  = 1.0 × 10-6 m or an X ray with  = 3.0 × 10-9 m?
        12-5 Radiation with  = 4.0 × 109 Hz or with  = 9.0 × 10-6 m?

PROBLEM       It's useful to develop a feeling for the amounts of energy that correspond to different parts of
        12-6
              the electromagnetic spectrum. Calculate the energies in kJ/mol of each of the following kinds of

              radiation:
              (a) A gamma ray with  = 5.0 × 10-11 m (b) An X ray with  = 3.0 × 10-9 m

12.6 Infrared Spectroscopy

In infrared (IR) spectroscopy, the IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from just above
the visible (7.8 × 10-7 m) to approximately 10-4 m, but only the midportion from 2.5 × 10-6 m to 2.5 × 10-5 m
398  12 · Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy

     is used by organic chemists (FIGURE 12.20. Wavelengths within the IR region are usually given in micrometers
     (1 m = 10-6 m), and frequencies are given in wavenumbers rather than in hertz. The wavenumber is the
     reciprocal of wavelength in centimeters and is therefore expressed in units of cm-1.

     Thus, the useful IR region is from 4000 to 400 cm-1, corresponding to energies of 48.0 kJ/mol to 4.80 kJ/mol
     (11.5-1.15 kcal/mol).

                                         FIGURE 12.20 The infrared and adjacent regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

     Why does an organic molecule absorb some wavelengths of IR radiation but not others? All molecules have a
     certain amount of energy and are in constant motion. Their bonds stretch and contract, atoms wag back and
     forth, and other molecular vibrations occur. Some of the kinds of allowed vibrations are shown below:

     The amount of energy a molecule contains is not continuously variable but is quantized. That is, a molecule can
     stretch or bend only at specific frequencies corresponding to specific energy levels. Take bond stretching, for
     example. Although we usually speak of bond lengths as if they were fixed, the numbers given are really averages.
     In fact, a typical C-H bond with an average bond length of 110 pm is actually vibrating at a specific frequency,
     alternately stretching and contracting as if there were a spring connecting the two atoms.

     When a molecule is irradiated with electromagnetic radiation, energy is absorbed if the frequency of the
     radiation matches the frequency of the vibration. The result of this energy absorption is an increased amplitude
     for the vibration; in other words, the "spring" connecting the two atoms stretches and compresses a bit further.
     Since each frequency absorbed by a molecule corresponds to a specific molecular motion, we can find what
     kinds of motions a molecule has by measuring its IR spectrum. By interpreting these motions, we can find out
     what kinds of bonds (functional groups) are present in the molecule.

     12.7 Interpreting Infrared Spectra

     The complete interpretation of an IR spectrum is difficult because most organic molecules have dozens of
     different bond stretching and bending motions, and thus have dozens of absorptions. On the one hand, this
     complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of
     fairly small molecules--little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the
     other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,

the complex region of the IR spectrum, from 1500 cm-1 to around 400 cm-1, is called the fingerprint region. If
two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.

Fortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional

groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another. The
C=O absorption of a ketone is almost always in the range 1680 to 1750 cm-1; the O-H absorption of an alcohol
is almost always in the range 3400 to 3650 cm-1; the C=C absorption of an alkene is almost always in the
range 1640 to 1680 cm-1; and so forth. By learning where characteristic functional-group absorptions occur,

it's possible to get structural information from IR spectra. TABLE 12.1 lists the characteristic IR bands of some

common functional groups.

     spectroscopy can be used. Although all three IR spectra contain many peaks, there are characteristic

     absorptions of  and      functional groups that allow the three compounds to be distinguished. Thus,

     1-hexene shows a characteristic   absorption at 1660 cm-1 and a vinylic =C-H absorption at 3100 cm-1,

     whereas 1-hexyne has a   absorption at 2100 cm-1 and a terminal alkyne              absorption at 3300 cm-1.

It helps in remembering the position of specific IR absorptions to divide the IR region from 4000 cm-1 to 400
cm-1 into four parts, as shown in FIGURE 12.22.

FIGURE 12.22 The four regions of the infrared spectrum: single bonds to hydrogen, triple bonds, double bonds, and fingerprint.

· The region from 4000 to 2500 cm-1 corresponds to absorptions caused by N-H, C-H, and O-H single-

bond stretching motions. N-H and O-H bonds absorb in the 3300 to 3600 cm-1 range; C-H bond stretching

occurs near 3000 cm-1.

· The region from 2500 to 2000 cm-1 is where triple-bond stretching occurs. Both         and      bonds

absorb here.

· The region from 2000 to 1500 cm-1 is where double bonds ( ,              , and  ) absorb. Carbonyl groups

generally absorb in the range 1680 to 1750 cm-1, and alkene stretching normally occurs in the narrow

range of 1640 to 1680 cm-1.

· The region below 1500 cm-1 is the fingerprint portion of the IR spectrum. A large number of absorptions

due to a variety of C-C, C-O, C-N, and C-X single-bond vibrations occur here.

Why do different functional groups absorb where they do? As noted previously, a good analogy is that of two
weights (atoms) connected by a spring (a bond). Short, strong bonds vibrate at a higher energy and higher
frequency than do long, weak bonds, just as a short, strong spring vibrates faster than a long, weak spring. Thus,
triple bonds absorb at a higher frequency than double bonds, which in turn absorb at a higher frequency than
single bonds. In addition, C-H, O-H, and N-H bonds vibrate at a higher frequency than bonds between heavier
C, O, and N atoms.

     12.8 Infrared Spectra of Some Common Functional Groups

     As each functional group is discussed in future chapters, the spectroscopic properties of that group will be
     described. For the present, we'll point out some distinguishing features of the hydrocarbon functional groups
     already studied and briefly preview some other common functional groups. We should also point out, however,
     that in addition to interpreting absorptions that are present in an IR spectrum, it's also possible to get structural
     information by noticing which absorptions are not present. If the spectrum of a compound has no absorptions
     at 3300 and 2150 cm-1, the compound is not a terminal alkyne; if the spectrum has no absorption near 3400
     cm-1, the compound is not an alcohol; and so on.

     Alkanes

     The IR spectrum of an alkane is fairly uninformative because no functional groups are present and all
     absorptions are due to C-H and C-C bonds. Alkane C-H bonds show a strong absorption from 2850 to 2960
     cm-1, and saturated C-C bonds show a number of bands in the 800 to 1300 cm-1 range. Since most organic
     compounds contain saturated alkane-like portions, most organic compounds have these characteristic IR
     absorptions. The C-H and C-C bands are clearly visible in the three spectra shown previously in FIGURE 12.21.

     Alkenes

     Alkenes show several characteristic stretching absorptions. Vinylic =C-H bonds absorb from 3020 to 3100

     cm-1, and alkene  bonds usually absorb near 1650 cm-1, although in some cases their peaks can be rather

     small and difficult to see clearly when the alkene is symmetric, or nearly so. Both absorptions are visible in the

     1-hexene spectrum in FIGURE 12.21b.

     Alkenes have characteristic =C-H out-of-plane bending absorptions in the 700 to 1000 cm-1 range, thereby

     allowing the substitution pattern on a double bond to be determined (FIGURE 12.23). For example,

     monosubstituted alkenes such as 1-hexene show strong characteristic bands at 910 and 990 cm-1, and

     1,1-disubstituted alkenes (      ) have an intense band at 890 cm-1.

                FIGURE 12.23 C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations for substituted alkenes.

Alkynes

Alkynes show a  stretching absorption at 2100 to 2260 cm-1, an absorption that is much more intense for

terminal alkynes than for internal alkynes. Terminal alkynes such as 1-hexyne also have a characteristic
stretching absorption at 3300 cm-1 (FIGURE 12.21c). This band is diagnostic for terminal alkynes because it is

fairly intense and quite sharp.

Aromatic Compounds

Aromatic compounds, such as benzene, have a weak C-H stretching absorption at 3030 cm-1, just to the left of a
typical saturated C-H band. In addition, they have a series of weak absorptions in the 1660 to 2000 cm-1 range
and a series of medium-intensity absorptions in the 1450 to 1600 cm-1 region. These latter absorptions are due

to complex molecular motions of the entire ring. The C-H out-of-plane bending region for benzene derivatives,
between 650 to 1000 cm-1, gives valuable information about the ring's substitution pattern, as it does for the

substitution pattern of alkenes (FIGURE 12.24).

     The IR spectrum of phenylacetylene, shown in Figure 12.29 at the end of this section, gives an example, clearly

     showing the following absorbances:  stretch at 3300 cm-1, C-H stretches from the benzene ring at 3000

     to 3100 cm-1,  stretches of the benzene ring between 1450 and 1600 cm-1, and out-of-plane bending of

     the ring's C-H groups, indicating monosubstitution at 750 cm-1.

     Alcohols

     The O-H functional group of alcohols is easy to spot. Alcohols have a characteristic band in the range 3400 to
     3650 cm-1 that is usually broad and intense. Hydrogen bonding between O-H groups is responsible for making

     the absorbance so broad. If an O-H stretch is present, it's hard to miss this band or to confuse it with anything

     else.

     Cyclohexanol (FIGURE 12.25) is a good example.

                                                                    FIGURE 12.25 IR spectrum of cyclohexanol.

     Amines

     The N-H functional group of amines is also easy to spot in the IR, with a characteristic absorption in the 3300
     to 3500 cm-1 range. Although alcohols absorb in the same range, an N-H absorption band is much sharper and
     less intense than an O-H band.

     Primary amines (R-NH2) have two absorbances--one for the symmetric stretching mode and one for the
     asymmetric mode (FIGURE 12.26). Secondary amines (R2N-H) only have one N-H stretching absorbance in this

Carbonyl Compounds

Carbonyl functional groups are the easiest to identify of all IR absorptions because of their sharp, intense peak
in the range 1670 to 1780 cm-1. Most important, the exact position of absorption within this range can often be
used to identify the exact kind of carbonyl functional group--aldehyde, ketone, ester, and so forth.
ALDEHYDES
Saturated aldehydes absorb at 1730 cm-1; aldehydes next to either a double bond or an aromatic ring absorb at
1705 cm-1.

The C-H group attached to the carbonyl is responsible for the characteristic IR absorbance for aldehydes at
2750 and 2850 cm-1 (FIGURE 12.27). Although these are not very intense, the absorbance at 2750 cm-1 is
helpful when trying to distinguish between an aldehyde and a ketone.

KETONES
Saturated open-chain ketones and six-membered cyclic ketones absorb at 1715 cm-1. Ring strain stiffens the

        bond, making five-membered cyclic ketones absorb at 1750 cm-1 and four-membered cyclic ketones
absorb at 1780 cm-1, about 20 to 30 cm-1 lower than the corresponding saturated ketone.

     Saturated esters have a

     range from the C-O portion of the functional group. Like other carbonyl functional groups, esters next to either

X-Ray Crystallography

The various spectroscopic techniques described in this and the next two chapters are enormously important in
chemistry and have been fine-tuned to such a degree that the structure of almost any molecule can be found.
Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and "see" its structure with your eyes?
Determining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy--you just look at it, let your eyes focus
the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the
object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there
is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see
anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths
of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm. Thus, to see a
molecule--whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens
of thousands--you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.
Let's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The
technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be
the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its
longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument
called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device
that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.
Once mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called CuK radiation with a
wavelength of 0.154 nm. When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule
and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense
spots against a null background.

Manipulation of the diffraction pattern to extract three-dimensional molecular data is a complex process, but
the final result is an electron-density map of the molecule. Because electrons are largely localized around
atoms, any two centers of electron density located within bonding distance of each other are assumed to
represent bonded atoms, leading to a recognizable chemical structure. So important is this structural
information for biochemistry that an online database of approximately 145,000 biological substances has been
created. Operated by Rutgers University and funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) is a worldwide repository for processing and distributing three-dimensional structural data for
biological macromolecules. We'll see how to access the PDB in the Chapter 26 Chemistry Matters.

Summary

Finding the structure of a new molecule, whether a small one synthesized in the laboratory or a large protein
found in living organisms, is central to the progression of chemistry and biochemistry. The structure of an
organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and
infrared spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry (MS) tells the molecular weight and formula of a molecule; infrared
(IR) spectroscopy identifies the functional groups present in the molecule.

In small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron
beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass-
to-charge ratio (m/z). The ionized sample molecule is called the molecular ion, M+, and measurement of its
mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by
interpreting the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion. Mass-spectral fragmentations are usually complex,
however, and interpretation is often difficult. In biological mass spectrometry, molecules are protonated using
either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and the protonated
molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis.

Infrared spectroscopy involves the interaction of a molecule with electromagnetic radiation. When an organic

molecule is irradiated with infrared energy, certain frequencies are absorbed by the molecule. The frequencies

absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular

vibrations such as bond stretching and bending. Since every functional group has a characteristic combination

of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal

alkyne  bond absorbs IR radiation of 3300 cm-1, and the alkene         bond absorbs in the range 1640 to

1680 cm-1. By observing which frequencies of infrared radiation are absorbed by a molecule and which are not,

it's possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.

subject in this chapter, focusing on NMR applications with small molecules, more advanced NMR techniques
are also used in biological chemistry to study protein structure and folding.

organic chemists. It's the method of structure determination that organic chemists usually turn to first.

     We saw in the chapter on Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy that mass
     spectrometry gives a molecule's formula and infrared spectroscopy identifies a molecule's functional groups.
     Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy complements these other techniques by mapping a molecule's
     carbon-hydrogen framework. Taken together, MS, IR, and NMR make it possible to determine the structures of
     even very complex molecules.

     13.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     Many kinds of nuclei behave as if they were spinning about an axis, somewhat as the earth spins daily. Because
     they're positively charged, these spinning nuclei act like tiny magnets and can interact with an external
     magnetic field, denoted B0. Not all nuclei act this way, but fortunately for organic chemists, both the proton (1H)
     and the 13C nucleus do have spins. The more common 12C isotope, however, does not have nuclear spin. (In
     speaking about NMR, the words proton and hydrogen are often used interchangeably, since a hydrogen nucleus
     is just a proton.) Let's see what the consequences of nuclear spin are and how we can use the results.

     In the absence of an external magnetic field, the spins of magnetic nuclei are oriented randomly. When a sample
     containing these nuclei is placed between the poles of a strong magnet, however, the nuclei adopt specific
     orientations, much as a compass needle orients in the earth's magnetic field. A spinning 1H or 13C nucleus
     can orient so that its own tiny magnetic field is aligned either with (parallel to) or against (antiparallel to) the
     external field. The two orientations don't have the same energy, however, and aren't equally likely. The parallel
     orientation is slightly lower in energy by an amount that depends on the strength of the external field, making
     this spin state very slightly favored over the antiparallel orientation (FIGURE 13.2).

     FIGURE 13.2 (a) Nuclear spins are oriented randomly in the absence of an external magnetic field but (b) have a specific orientation in
     the presence of an external field, B0. Some of the spins (red) are aligned parallel to the external field while others (blue) are antiparallel.
     The parallel spin state is slightly lower in energy and therefore favored.

     If the oriented nuclei are irradiated with electromagnetic radiation of the proper frequency, energy absorption
     occurs and the lower-energy spin state "flips" to the higher-energy state. When this spin-flip occurs, the
     magnetic nuclei are said to be in resonance with the applied radiation--hence the name nuclear magnetic
     resonance.
     The exact frequency necessary for resonance depends both on the strength of the external magnetic field, the
     identity of the nucleus, and the electronic environment of the nucleus. If a very strong magnetic field is applied,
     the energy difference between the two spin states is larger and higher-frequency (higher-energy) radiation is
     required for a spin-flip. If a weaker magnetic field is applied, less energy is required to effect the transition
     between nuclear spin states (FIGURE 13.3).

FIGURE 13.3 The energy difference E between nuclear spin states depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field. Absorption
of energy with frequency  converts a nucleus from a lower spin state to a higher spin state. (a) Spin states have equal energies in the absence
of an applied magnetic field but (b) have unequal energies in the presence of a magnetic field. At  = 200 MHz, E = 8.0 × 10-5 kJ/mol (1.9
× 10-5 kcal/mol). (c) The energy difference between spin states is greater at larger applied fields. At  = 500 MHz, E = 2.0 × 10-4 kJ/mol.

In practice, superconducting magnets that produce enormously powerful fields up to 23.5 tesla (T) are
sometimes used, but field strengths in the range of 4.7 to 7.0 T are more common. At a magnetic field strength
of 4.7 T, so-called radiofrequency (rf) energy in the 200 MHz range (1 MHz = 106 Hz) brings a 1H nucleus into
resonance, and rf energy of 50 MHz brings a 13C nucleus into resonance. At the highest field strength currently
available in commercial instruments (23.5 T), 1000 MHz energy is required for 1H spectroscopy. These energies
needed for NMR are much smaller than those required for IR spectroscopy; 200 MHz rf energy corresponds to
only 8.0 × 10-5 kJ/mol versus the 4.8 to 48 kJ/mol needed for IR spectroscopy.

1H and 13C nuclei are not unique in their ability to exhibit the NMR phenomenon. All nuclei with an odd number
of protons (1H, 2H, 14N, 19F, 31P, for example) and all nuclei with an odd number of neutrons (13C, for example)
show magnetic properties. Only nuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons (12C, 16O, 32S) do not
give rise to magnetic phenomena (TABLE 13.1).

PROBLEM       The amount of energy required to spin-flip a nucleus depends both on the strength of the external

     13.2 The Nature of NMR Absorptions

     From the description thus far, you might expect all 1H nuclei in a molecule to absorb energy at the same
     frequency and all 13C nuclei to absorb at the same frequency. If so, we would observe only a single NMR
     absorption signal in the 1H or 13C spectrum of a molecule, a situation that would be of little use. In fact, the
     absorption frequency is not the same for all 1H or all 13C nuclei.

     All nuclei in molecules are surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule,
     the electrons moving around nuclei set up tiny local magnetic fields of their own. These local magnetic fields
     act in opposition to the applied field so that the effective field actually felt by the nucleus is a bit weaker than the
     applied field.

     In describing this effect of local fields, we say that nuclei experience shielding from the full effect of the
     applied field by the surrounding electrons. Because each chemically distinct nucleus in a molecule is in a
     slightly different electronic environment, each nucleus is shielded to a slightly different extent and the effective
     magnetic field felt by each is slightly different. These tiny differences in the effective magnetic fields
     experienced by different nuclei can be detected, and we thus see a distinct NMR signal for each chemically
     distinct 13C or 1H nucleus in a molecule. As a result, an NMR spectrum effectively maps the carbon-hydrogen
     framework of an organic molecule. With practice, it's possible to read this map and derive structural
     information.

     FIGURE 13.4 shows both the 1H and the 13C NMR spectra of methyl acetate, CH3CO2CH3. The horizontal axis
     shows the effective field strength felt by the nuclei, and the vertical axis indicates the intensity of absorption
     of rf energy. Each peak in the NMR spectrum corresponds to a chemically distinct 1H or 13C nucleus in the
     molecule. Note that NMR spectra are formatted with the zero absorption line at the bottom, whereas IR spectra
     are formatted with the zero absorption line at the top; Section 12.5. Note also that 1H and 13C spectra can't be
     observed simultaneously on the same spectrometer because different amounts of energy are required to spin-
     flip the different kinds of nuclei. The two spectra must be recorded separately.

labeled "TMS" at the far right of each spectrum is a calibration peak, as explained in the next section.

The 13C NMR spectrum of methyl acetate in FIGURE 13.4b shows three peaks, one for each of the three
chemically distinct carbon atoms in the molecule. The 1H NMR spectrum in FIGURE 13.4a shows only two
peaks, however, even though methyl acetate has six hydrogens. One peak is due to the CH3CO hydrogens, and
the other to the -OCH3 hydrogens. Because the three hydrogens in each methyl group have the same electronic
environment, they are shielded to the same extent and are said to be equivalent. Chemically equivalent nuclei
always show the same absorption. The two methyl groups themselves, however, are not equivalent, so the two
sets of hydrogens absorb at different positions.

The operation of a basic NMR spectrometer is illustrated in FIGURE 13.5. An organic sample is dissolved in a
suitable solvent (usually deuteriochloroform, CDCl3, which has no hydrogens) and placed in a thin glass tube
between the poles of a magnet. The strong magnetic field causes the 1H and 13C nuclei in the molecule to align
in one of the two possible orientations, and the sample is irradiated with rf energy. If the frequency of the rf
irradiation is held constant and the strength of the applied magnetic field is varied, each nucleus comes into
resonance at a slightly different field strength. A sensitive detector monitors the absorption of rf energy, and its
electronic signal is then amplified and displayed as a peak.

FIGURE 13.5 Schematic operation of a basic NMR spectrometer. A thin glass tube containing the sample solution is placed between the
poles of a strong magnet and irradiated with rf energy.

NMR spectroscopy differs from IR spectroscopy (Section 12.6-Section 12.8) in that the timescales of the two
techniques are quite different. The absorption of infrared energy by a molecule giving rise to a change in
vibrational amplitude is an essentially instantaneous process (about 10-13 s), but the NMR process is much
slower (about 10-3 s). This difference in timescales between IR and NMR spectroscopy is analogous to the
difference between cameras operating at very fast and very slow shutter speeds. The fast camera (IR) takes an
instantaneous picture and freezes the action. If two rapidly interconverting species are present, IR spectroscopy
records the spectrum of both. The slow camera (NMR), however, takes a blurred, time-averaged picture. If two
species interconverting faster than 103 times per second are present in a sample, NMR records only a single,
averaged spectrum, rather than separate spectra of the two discrete species.

Because of this blurring effect, NMR spectroscopy can be used to measure the rates and activation energies of
very fast chemical processes. In cyclohexane, for example, a ring-flip (Section 4.6) occurs so rapidly at room
temperature that axial and equatorial hydrogens can't be distinguished by NMR; only a single, averaged 1H NMR
absorption is seen for cyclohexane at 25 °C. At -90 °C, however, the ring-flip is slowed down enough that two
absorption peaks are visible, one for the six axial hydrogens and one for the six equatorial hydrogens. Knowing
the temperature and the rate at which signal blurring begins to occur, it's possible to calculate that the activation
energy for the cyclohexane ring-flip is 45 kJ/mol (10.8 kcal/mol).

     13.3 Chemical Shifts

     NMR spectra are displayed on charts that show the applied field strength increasing from left to right (FIGURE
     13.6). Thus, the left part of the chart is the low-field, or downfield, side, and the right part is the high-field, or
     upfield, side. Nuclei that absorb on the downfield side of the chart require a lower field strength for resonance,
     implying that they have less shielding. Nuclei that absorb on the upfield side require a higher field strength for
     resonance, implying that they have more shielding.

     FIGURE 13.6 The NMR chart. The downfield, deshielded side is on the left, and the upfield, shielded side is on the right. The
     tetramethylsilane (TMS) absorption is used as reference point.

     To define the position of an absorption, the NMR chart is calibrated and a reference point is used. In practice,
     a small amount of tetramethylsilane [TMS; (CH3)4Si] is added to the sample so that a reference absorption peak
     is produced when the spectrum is run. TMS is used as reference for both 1H and 13C measurements because
     in both cases it produces a single peak that occurs upfield of other absorptions normally found in organic
     compounds. The 1H and 13C spectra of methyl acetate in FIGURE 13.4 have the TMS reference peak indicated.

     The position on the chart at which a nucleus absorbs is called its chemical shift. The chemical shift of TMS is
     set as the zero point, and other absorptions normally occur downfield, to the left on the chart. NMR charts are
     calibrated using an arbitrary scale called the delta () scale, where 1  equals 1 part-per-million (1 ppm) of the
     spectrometer operating frequency. For example, if we were measuring the 1H NMR spectrum of a sample using
     an instrument operating at 200 MHz, 1  would be 1 part per million of 200,000,000 Hz, or 200 Hz. If we were
     measuring the spectrum using a 500 MHz instrument, 1  = 500 Hz. The following equation can be used for any
     absorption:

     Although this method of calibrating NMR charts may seem complex, there's a good reason for it. As we saw
     earlier, the rf frequency required to bring a given nucleus into resonance depends on the spectrometer's
     magnetic field strength. But because there are many different kinds of spectrometers with many different
     magnetic field strengths available, chemical shifts given in frequency units (Hz) vary from one instrument to
     another. Thus, a resonance that occurs at 120 Hz downfield from TMS on one spectrometer might occur at 600
     Hz downfield from TMS on another spectrometer with a more powerful magnet.

     By using a system of measurement in which NMR absorptions are expressed in relative terms (parts per million
     relative to spectrometer frequency) rather than absolute terms (Hz), it's possible to compare spectra obtained

on different instruments. The chemical shift of an NMR absorption in  units is constant, regardless of the
operating frequency of the spectrometer. A 1H nucleus that absorbs at 2.0  on a 200 MHz instrument also
absorbs at 2.0  on a 500 MHz instrument.

The range in which most NMR absorptions occur is quite narrow. Almost all 1H NMR absorptions occur from
0 to 10  downfield from the proton absorption of TMS, and almost all 13C absorptions occur from 1 to
220  downfield from the carbon absorption of TMS. Thus, there is a likelihood that accidental overlap of
nonequivalent signals will occur. The advantage of using an instrument with higher field strength (say, 500
MHz) rather than lower field strength (200 MHz) is that different NMR absorptions are more widely separated
at the higher field strength. The chances that two signals will accidentally overlap are therefore lessened, and
interpretation of spectra becomes easier. For example, two signals that are only 20 Hz apart at 200 MHz (0.1
ppm) are 50 Hz apart at 500 MHz (still 0.1 ppm).

              (c) How many hertz downfield from TMS does this 500 MHz resonance correspond to?

13.4 Chemical Shifts in 1H NMR Spectroscopy

As mentioned previously, differences in chemical shifts are caused by the small local magnetic field of electrons
surrounding different nuclei. Nuclei that are more strongly shielded by electrons require a higher applied field
to bring them into resonance so they absorb on the right side of the NMR chart. Nuclei that are less strongly
shielded need a lower applied field for resonance so they absorb on the left of the NMR chart.

Most 1H chemical shifts fall within the range 0 to 10 , which can be divided into the five regions shown in
TABLE 13.2. By remembering the positions of these regions, it's often possible to tell at a glance what kinds of
protons a molecule contains.

TABLE 13.2 Regions of the 1H NMR Spectrum

TABLE 13.3 shows the correlation of 1H chemical shift with electronic environment in more detail. In general,
protons bonded to saturated, sp3-hybridized carbons absorb at higher fields, whereas protons bonded to
sp2-hybridized carbons absorb at lower fields. Protons on carbons that are bonded to electronegative atoms,

such as N, O, or halogen, also absorb at lower fields.

Predicting Chemical Shifts in 1H NMR Spectra

Methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate (CH3)2CCO2CH3 has two peaks in its 1H NMR spectrum. What are their
approximate chemical shifts?

Strategy
Identify the types of hydrogens in the molecule, and note whether each is alkyl, vinylic, or next to an
electronegative atom. Then predict where each absorbs, using TABLE 13.3 if necessary.

Solution
The -OCH3 protons absorb around 3.5 to 4.0  because they are on carbon bonded to oxygen. The (CH3)3C-
protons absorb near 1.0  because they are typical alkane-like protons.

PROBLEM Each of the following compounds has a single 1H NMR peak. Approximately where would you

13-6 expect each compound to absorb?

PROBLEM Identify the different types of protons in the following molecule, and tell where you would expect
        13-7 each to absorb:

13.5 Integration of 1H NMR Absorptions: Proton Counting

Look at the 1H NMR spectrum of methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate in FIGURE 13.7. There are two peaks,
corresponding to the two kinds of protons, but the peaks aren't the same size. The peak at 1.2 , due to the
(CH3)3C- protons, is larger than the peak at 3.7 , due to the -OCH3 protons.

FIGURE 13.7 The 1H NMR spectrum of methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate. Integrating the peaks in a stair-step manner shows that they have
a 1 : 3 ratio, corresponding to the ratio of the numbers of protons (3 : 9) responsible for each peak. Modern instruments give a direct digital
readout of relative peak areas.

The area under each peak is proportional to the number of protons causing that peak. By electronically
measuring, or integrating, the area under each peak, it's possible to measure the relative numbers of the
different kinds of protons in a molecule.
426  13 · Structure Determination: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     Modern NMR instruments provide a digital readout of relative peak areas, but an older, more visual method
     displays the integrated peak areas as a stair-step line, with the height of each step proportional to the area under
     the peak, and therefore proportional to the relative number of protons causing the peak. For example, the two
     steps for the peaks in methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate have a 1 : 3 (or 3 : 9) height ratio when integrated--exactly
     what we expect because the three -OCH3 protons are equivalent and the nine (CH3)3C- protons are equivalent.

     PROBLEM       How many peaks would you expect in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,4-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene,
             13-8  or p-xylene)? What ratio of peak areas would you expect on integration of the spectrum? Refer
                   to Table 13.3 for approximate chemical shifts, and sketch what the spectrum would look like.
                   (Remember from Section 2.4 that aromatic rings have two resonance forms.)

     13.6 Spin-Spin Splitting in 1H NMR Spectra

     In the 1H NMR spectra we've seen thus far, each different kind of proton in a molecule has given rise to a single

     peak. It often happens, though, that the absorption of a proton splits into multiple peaks, called a multiplet. For
     example, in the 1H NMR spectrum of bromoethane shown in FIGURE 13.8, the -CH2Br protons appear as four
     peaks (a quartet) centered at 3.42  and the -CH3 protons appear as three peaks (a triplet) centered at 1.68 .

     FIGURE 13.8 The 1H NMR spectrum of bromoethane, CH3CH2Br. The -CH2Br protons appear as a quartet at 3.42 , and the -CH3 protons
     appear as a triplet at 1.68 .

     Called spin-spin splitting, multiple absorptions of a nucleus are caused by the interaction, or coupling, of the
     spins of nearby nuclei. In other words, the tiny magnetic field produced by one nucleus affects the magnetic
     field felt by a neighboring nucleus. Look at the -CH3 protons in bromoethane, for example. The three equivalent
     -CH3 protons are neighbored by two other magnetic nuclei--the two protons on the adjacent -CH2Br group.
     Each of the neighboring -CH2Br protons has its own nuclear spin, which can align either with or against the
     applied field, producing a tiny effect that is felt by the -CH3 protons.
     There are three ways in which the spins of the two -CH2Br protons can align, as shown in FIGURE 13.9. If both
     proton spins align with the applied field, the total effective field felt by the neighboring -CH3 protons is slightly
     larger than it would be otherwise. Consequently, the applied field necessary to cause resonance is slightly
     reduced. Alternatively, if one of the -CH2Br proton spins aligns with the field and one aligns against the field,
     there is no effect on the neighboring -CH3 protons. (This arrangement can occur in two ways, depending on
     which of the two proton spins aligns which way.) Finally, if both -CH2Br proton spins align against the applied
     field, the effective field felt by the -CH3 protons is slightly smaller than it would be otherwise, and the applied
     field needed for resonance is slightly increased.

FIGURE 13.9 The origin of spin-spin splitting in bromoethane. The nuclear spins of neighboring protons, indicated by horizontal arrows,
align either with or against the applied field, causing the splitting of absorptions into multiplets.

Any given molecule has only one of the three possible alignments of -CH2Br spins, but in a large collection
of molecules, all three spin states are represented in a 1 : 2 : 1 statistical ratio. We therefore find that the
neighboring -CH3 protons come into resonance at three slightly different values of the applied field, and we see
a 1 : 2 : 1 triplet in the NMR spectrum. One resonance is a little above where it would be without coupling, one
is at the same place it would be without coupling, and the third resonance is a little below where it would be
without coupling.
In the same way that the -CH3 absorption of bromoethane is split into a triplet, the -CH2Br absorption is split
into a quartet. The three spins of the neighboring -CH3 protons can align in four possible combinations: all
three with the applied field, two with and one against (three ways), one with and two against (three ways), or all
three against. Thus, four peaks are produced for the -CH2Br protons in a 1 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio.
As a general rule, called the n + 1 rule, protons that have n equivalent neighboring protons show n + 1 peaks in
their NMR spectrum. For example, the spectrum of 2-bromopropane in FIGURE 13.10 shows a doublet at 1.71
 and a seven-line multiplet, or septet, at 4.28 . The septet is caused by splitting of the -CHBr- proton signal
by six equivalent neighboring protons on the two methyl groups (n = 6 leads to 6 + 1 = 7 peaks). The doublet is
due to signal splitting of the six equivalent methyl protons by the single -CHBr- proton (n = 1 leads to 2 peaks).
Integration confirms the expected 6 : 1 ratio.

FIGURE 13.10 The 1H NMR spectrum of 2-bromopropane. The -CH3 proton signal at 1.71  is split into a doublet, and the -CHBr- proton
signal at 4.28  is split into a septet. Note that the distance between peaks is the same in both multiplets. Note also that the two outer peaks
of the septet are small enough to be nearly missed.

The distance between peaks in a multiplet is called the coupling constant and is denoted J. Coupling constants
are measured in hertz and generally fall in the range 0 to 18 Hz. The exact value of the coupling constant
between two neighboring protons depends on the geometry of the molecule, but a typical value for an open-
chain alkane is J = 6 to 8 Hz. The same coupling constant is shared by both groups of hydrogens whose spins are
coupled and is independent of spectrometer field strength. In bromoethane, for instance, the -CH2Br protons
428  13 · Structure Determination: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     are coupled to the -CH3 protons and appear as a quartet with J = 7 Hz. The -CH3 protons appear as a triplet
     with the same J = 7 Hz coupling constant.

     Because coupling is a reciprocal interaction between two adjacent groups of protons, it's sometimes possible
     to tell which multiplets in a complex NMR spectrum are related to each other. If two multiplets have the same
     coupling constant, they are probably related, and the protons causing those multiplets are therefore adjacent in
     the molecule.

     The most commonly observed coupling patterns and the relative intensities of lines in their multiplets are listed
     in TABLE 13.4. Note that it's not possible for a given proton to have five equivalent neighboring protons. (Why
     not?) A six-line multiplet, or sextet, is therefore found only when a proton has five nonequivalent neighboring
     protons that coincidentally happen to be coupled with an identical coupling constant J.

     Spin-spin splitting in 1H NMR can be summarized by three rules.

     RULE 1
     Chemically equivalent protons don't show spin-spin splitting. Equivalent protons may be on the same
     carbon or on different carbons, but their signals don't split.

     RULE 2
     The signal of a proton with n equivalent neighboring protons is split into a multiplet of n + 1 peaks with
     coupling constant J. Protons that are farther than two carbon atoms apart don't usually couple, although they
     sometimes show weak coupling when they are separated by a  bond.

     RULE 3
     Two groups of protons coupled to each other have the same coupling constant, J.
     The spectrum of para-methoxypropiophenone in FIGURE 13.11 further illustrates these three rules. The
     downfield absorptions at 6.91 and 7.93  are due to the four aromatic-ring protons. There are two kinds of

in the region expected for protons on carbon next to an unsaturated center, and their signal is split into a quartet

Assigning a Chemical Structure from a 1H NMR Spectrum

Propose a structure for a compound, C5H12O, that fits the following 1H NMR data: 0.92  (3 H, triplet, J = 7 Hz),
1.20  (6 H, singlet), 1.50  (2 H, quartet, J = 7 Hz), 1.64  (1 H, broad singlet).

Strategy
It's best to begin solving structural problems by calculating a molecule's degree of unsaturation (we'll see this
again in Worked Example 13.4). In the present instance, a formula of C5H12O corresponds to a saturated, open-
chain molecule, either an alcohol or an ether.

To interpret the NMR information, let's look at each absorption individually. The three-proton absorption at
0.92  is due to a methyl group in an alkane-like environment, and the triplet-splitting pattern implies that the
CH3 is next to a CH2. Thus, our molecule contains an ethyl group, CH3CH2-. The six-proton singlet at 1.20  is
due to two equivalent alkane-like methyl groups attached to a carbon with no hydrogens, (CH3)2C, and the two-
proton quartet at 1.50  is due to the CH2 of the ethyl group. All 5 carbons and 11 of the 12 hydrogens in the
molecule are now accounted for. The remaining hydrogen, which appears as a broad one-proton singlet at 1.64
, is probably due to an OH group, since there is no other way to account for it. Putting the pieces together gives
the structure: 2-methyl-2-butanol.

     13.7 1H NMR Spectroscopy and Proton Equivalence

     Because each electronically distinct hydrogen in a molecule has its own unique absorption, one use of 1H NMR
     is to find out how many kinds of electronically nonequivalent hydrogens are present. In the 1H NMR spectrum
     of methyl acetate shown previously in FIGURE 13.4a, for instance, there are two signals, corresponding to the
     two kinds of nonequivalent protons present, CH3CO protons and -OCH3 protons.

     For relatively small molecules, a quick look at the structure is often enough to decide how many kinds of
     protons are present and thus how many NMR absorptions might appear. If in doubt, though, the equivalence or
     nonequivalence of two protons can be determined by comparing the structures that would be formed if each
     hydrogen were replaced by an X group. There are four possibilities.

       · One possibility is that the protons are chemically unrelated and thus nonequivalent. If so, the products
           formed on substitution of H by X would be different constitutional isomers. In butane, for instance, the
           -CH3 protons are different from the -CH2- protons. They therefore give different products on substitution
           by X than the -CH2 protons and would likely show different NMR absorptions.

       · A second possibility is that the protons are chemically identical and thus electronically equivalent. If so, the
           same product would be formed regardless of which H is substituted by X. In butane, for instance, the six
           -CH3 hydrogens on C1 and C4 are identical, would give the identical structure on substitution by X, and
           would show an identical NMR absorption. Such protons are said to be homotopic.

· The third possibility is a bit more subtle. Although they might at first seem homotopic, the two -CH2-
   hydrogens on C2 in butane (and the two -CH2- hydrogens on C3) are in fact not identical. Substitution
   by X of a hydrogen at C2 (or C3) would form a new chirality center, so different enantiomers (Section 5.1)
   would result, depending on whether the pro-R or pro-S hydrogen had been substituted (Section 5.11).
   Such hydrogens, whose substitution by X would lead to different enantiomers, are said to be enantiotopic.
   Enantiotopic hydrogens, even though not identical, are nevertheless electronically equivalent and thus
   have the same NMR absorption.

· The fourth possibility arises in chiral molecules, such as (R)-2-butanol. The two -CH2- hydrogens at C3
   are neither homotopic nor enantiotopic. Because substitution of a hydrogen at C3 would form a second
   chirality center, different diastereomers (Section 5.6) would result, depending on whether the pro-R or
   pro-S hydrogen had been substituted. Such hydrogens, whose substitution by X leads to different
   diastereomers, are said to be diastereotopic. Diastereotopic hydrogens are neither chemically nor
   electronically equivalent. They are completely different and would likely show different NMR absorptions.

     13.8 More Complex Spin-Spin Splitting Patterns

     In the 1H NMR spectra we've seen so far, the chemical shifts of different protons have been distinct and
     the spin-spin splitting patterns have been straightforward. It often happens, however, that different kinds of
     hydrogens in a molecule have accidentally overlapping signals. The spectrum of toluene (methylbenzene) in
     FIGURE 13.13, for example, shows that the five aromatic ring protons give a complex, overlapping pattern, even
     though they aren't all equivalent.

        FIGURE 13.13 The 1H NMR spectrum of toluene, showing the accidental overlap of the five nonequivalent aromatic ring protons.

     Yet another complication in 1H NMR spectroscopy arises when a signal is split by two or more nonequivalent
     kinds of protons, as is the case with trans-cinnamaldehyde, isolated from oil of cinnamon (FIGURE 13.14).
     Although the n + 1 rule predicts splitting caused by equivalent protons, splittings caused by nonequivalent
     protons are more complex.

     FIGURE 13.14 The 1H NMR spectrum of trans-cinnamaldehyde. The signal of the proton at C2 (blue) is split into four peaks--a doublet of
     doublets--by the two nonequivalent neighboring protons.

     To understand the 1H NMR spectrum of trans-cinnamaldehyde, we have to isolate the different parts and look
     at the signal of each proton individually.

       · The five aromatic proton signals (black in FIGURE 13.14) overlap into a complex pattern with a large peak
          at 7.42  and a broad absorption at 7.57 .

       · The aldehyde proton signal at C1 (red) appears in the normal downfield position at 9.69  and is split into a
          doublet with J = 6 Hz by the adjacent proton at C2.

13.9 · Uses of 1H NMR Spectroscopy                                                                                           433

  · The vinylic proton at C3 (green) is next to the aromatic ring and is therefore shifted downfield from the
     normal vinylic region. This C3 proton signal appears as a doublet centered at 7.49 . Because it has one
     neighbor proton at C2, its signal is split into a doublet, with J = 12 Hz.

  · The C2 vinylic proton signal (blue) appears at 6.73  and shows an interesting, four-line absorption pattern.
     It is coupled to the two nonequivalent protons at C1 and C3 with two different coupling constants: J1-2 = 6
     Hz and J2-3 = 12 Hz.

A good way to understand the effect of multiple coupling, such as that occurring for the C2 proton of
trans-cinnamaldehyde, is to draw a tree diagram, like that in FIGURE 13.15. The diagram shows the individual
effect of each coupling constant on the overall pattern. Coupling with the C3 proton splits the signal of the C2
proton in trans-cinnamaldehyde into a doublet with J =12 Hz. Further coupling with the aldehyde proton then
splits each peak of the doublet into new doublets with J = 6 Hz, and we therefore observe a four-line spectrum
for the C2 proton.

FIGURE 13.15 A tree diagram for the C2 proton of trans-cinnamaldehyde shows how it is coupled to the C1 and C3 protons with
different coupling constants.

One further trait evident in the cinnamaldehyde spectrum is that the four peaks of the C2 proton signal are
not all the same size. The two left-hand peaks are somewhat larger than the two right-hand peaks. Such a size
difference occurs whenever coupled nuclei have similar chemical shifts--in this case, 7.49  for the C3 proton
and 6.73  for the C2 proton. The peaks nearer the signal of the coupled partner are always larger, and the peaks
farther from the signal of the coupled partner are always smaller. Thus, the left-hand peaks of the C2 proton
multiplet at 6.73  are closer to the C3 proton absorption at 7.49  and are larger than the right-hand peaks. At
the same time, the right-hand peak of the C3 proton doublet at 7.49  is larger than the left-hand peak because
it is closer to the C2 proton multiplet at 6.73 . This skewing effect on multiplets can often be useful because it
tells where to look in the spectrum to find the coupled partner: look in the direction of the larger peaks.

PROBLEM 3-Bromo-1-phenyl-1-propene shows a complex NMR spectrum in which the vinylic proton at C2 is
      13-15 coupled with both the C1 vinylic proton (J = 16 Hz) and the C3 methylene protons (J = 8 Hz). Draw a
                 tree diagram for the C2 proton signal, and account for the fact that a five-line multiplet is observed.

13.9 Uses of 1H NMR Spectroscopy

NMR is used to help identify the product of nearly every reaction run in the laboratory. For example, we said in
Section 8.5 that hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes occurs with non-Markovnikov regiochemistry to yield the
less highly substituted alcohol. With the help of NMR, we can now prove this statement.

Does hydroboration-oxidation of methylenecyclohexane yield cyclohexylmethanol or 1-methylcyclohexanol?
434  13 · Structure Determination: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     The 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction product is shown in FIGURE 13.16a. The spectrum shows a two-proton
     peak at 3.40 , indicating that the product has a -CH2- group bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom
     (-CH2OH). Furthermore, the spectrum shows no large three-proton singlet absorption near 1 , where we

     would expect the signal of a quaternary -CH3 group to appear. (FIGURE 13.16b) gives the spectrum of

     1-methylcyclohexanol, the alternative product.) Thus, it's clear that cyclohexylmethanol is the reaction product.

     13.10 13C NMR Spectroscopy: Signal Averaging and FT-NMR

     In some ways, it's surprising that carbon NMR is even possible. After all, 12C, the most abundant carbon isotope,
     has no nuclear spin and can't be seen by NMR. Carbon-13 is the only naturally occurring carbon isotope with a
     nuclear spin, but its natural abundance is only 1.1%. Thus, only about 1 of every 100 carbon atoms in an organic
     sample can be observed by NMR. The problem of low abundance has been overcome, however, by the use of
     signal averaging and Fourier-transform NMR (FT-NMR). Signal averaging increases instrument sensitivity, and
     FT-NMR increases instrument speed.
     The low natural abundance of 13C means that any individual NMR spectrum is extremely "noisy." That is, the
     signals are so weak that they are cluttered with random background electronic noise, as shown in FIGURE
     13.17a. If, however, hundreds or thousands of individual runs are added together by a computer and then
     averaged, a greatly improved spectrum results (FIGURE 13.17b). Background noise, because of its random
     nature, increases very slowly as the runs are added, while the nonzero signals stand out clearly. Unfortunately,

the value of signal averaging is limited when using the method of NMR spectrometer operation described in
Section 13.2, because it takes about 5 to 10 minutes to obtain a single spectrum. Thus, a faster way to obtain
spectra is needed if signal averaging is to be used.

FIGURE 13.17 Carbon-13 NMR spectra of 1-pentanol, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2OH. Spectrum (a) is a single run, showing the large amount of
background noise. Spectrum (b) is an average of 200 runs.

In the method of NMR spectrometer operation described in Section 13.2, the rf frequency is held constant while
the strength of the magnetic field is varied so that all signals in the spectrum are recorded sequentially. In
the FT-NMR technique used by modern spectrometers, however, all the signals are recorded simultaneously.
A sample is placed in a magnetic field of constant strength and is irradiated with a short pulse of rf energy
that covers the entire range of useful frequencies. All 1H or 13C nuclei in the sample resonate at once, giving
a complex, composite signal that is mathematically manipulated using so-called Fourier transforms and then
displayed in the usual way. Because all resonance signals are collected at once, it takes only a few seconds rather
than a few minutes to record an entire spectrum.

Combining the speed of FT-NMR with the sensitivity enhancement of signal averaging is what gives modern
NMR spectrometers their power. Literally thousands of spectra can be taken and averaged in a few hours,
resulting in sensitivity so high that a 13C NMR spectrum can be obtained from less than 0.1 mg of sample and a
1H spectrum can be recorded from only a few micrograms.

One further question needs to be answered before moving forward with our discussion of 13C NMR. Why is
spin-spin splitting seen only for 1H NMR? Why is there no splitting of carbon signals into multiplets in 13C
NMR? After all, you might expect that the spin of a given 13C nucleus would couple with the spin of an adjacent
magnetic nucleus, either 13C or 1H.

No coupling of a 13C nucleus with nearby carbons is seen because their low natural abundance makes it unlikely
that two 13C nuclei will be adjacent. No coupling of a 13C nucleus with nearby hydrogens is seen because 13C
spectra are normally recorded using broadband decoupling. At the same time that the sample is irradiated
with a pulse of rf energy to cover the carbon resonance frequencies, it is also irradiated by a second band of rf
energy covering all the hydrogen resonance frequencies. This second irradiation makes the hydrogens spin-flip
so rapidly that their local magnetic fields average to zero and no coupling with carbon spins occurs.

     13.11 Characteristics of 13C NMR Spectroscopy

     At its simplest, 13C NMR makes it possible to count the number of different carbon atoms in a molecule. Look at
     the 13C NMR spectra of methyl acetate and 1-pentanol shown previously in FIGURE 13.4b and FIGURE 13.17b.
     In each case, a single sharp resonance line is observed for each different carbon atom.

     Most 13C resonances are between 0 and 220 ppm downfield from the TMS reference line, with the exact
     chemical shift of each 13C resonance dependent on that carbon's electronic environment within the molecule.
     FIGURE 13.18 shows the correlation of chemical shift with environment.

                                                            FIGURE 13.18 Chemical shift correlations for 13C NMR.

     The factors that determine chemical shifts are complex, but it's possible to make some generalizations from the
     data in FIGURE 13.18. One trend is that a carbon atom's chemical shift is affected by the electronegativity of
     nearby atoms. Carbons bonded to oxygen, nitrogen, or halogen absorb downfield (to the left) of typical alkane
     carbons. Because electronegative atoms attract electrons, they pull electrons away from neighboring carbon
     atoms, causing those carbons to be deshielded and to come into resonance at a lower field.

     Another trend is that sp3-hybridized carbons generally absorb from 0 to 90 , while sp2 carbons absorb from
     110 to 220 . Carbonyl carbons (C=O) are particularly distinct in 13C NMR and are always found at the low-
     field end of the spectrum, from 160 to 220 . FIGURE 13.19 shows the 13C NMR spectra of 2-butanone and
     para-bromoacetophenone and indicates the peak assignments. Note that the C=O carbons are at the left edge of

                             FIGURE 13.19 Carbon-13 NMR spectra of (a) 2-butanone and (b) para-bromoacetophenone.

The 13C NMR spectrum of para-bromoacetophenone is interesting in several ways. Note particularly that
only six carbon absorptions are observed, even though the molecule contains eight carbons.
para-bromoacetophenone has a symmetry plane that makes ring carbons 4 and 4, and ring carbons 5 and
5 equivalent. (Remember from Section 2.4 that aromatic rings have two resonance forms.) Thus, the six ring
carbons show only four absorptions in the range 128 to 137 .

A second interesting point about both spectra in FIGURE 13.19 is that the peaks aren't uniform in size. Some
peaks are larger than others even though they are one-carbon resonances (except for the two 2-carbon peaks of
para-bromoacetophenone). This difference in peak size is a general feature of broadband-decoupled 13C NMR
spectra, and explains why we can't integrate 13C NMR spectra in the same way we integrate the resonances in
a 1H NMR spectrum. The local environment of each carbon atom determines not only its chemical shift but
also the time it takes for the nuclei to return to their equilibrium state after receiving a pulse of rf radiation and
flipping their spins. Quaternary carbons, regardless of their hybridization state or substituents, typically give
smaller resonances than primary, secondary, or tertiary carbons.

     Numerous techniques developed in recent years have made it possible to obtain enormous amounts of

of all carbons. Next, a second spectrum called a DEPT-90 is run, using special conditions under which only

signals due to CH carbons appear. Signals due to CH3, CH2, and quaternary carbons are absent. Finally, a third
spectrum called a DEPT-135 is run, using conditions under which CH3 and CH resonances appear as positive

carbons are again absent.

peaks from the positive peaks in the DEPT-135 spectrum, and quaternary carbons are identified by subtracting

     Assigning a Chemical Structure from a 13C NMR Spectrum

     Propose a structure for an alcohol, C4H10O, that has the following 13C NMR spectral data:
          Broadband decoupled 13C NMR: 19.0, 31.7, 69.5 ;
          DEPT-90: 31.7 ;
          DEPT-135: positive peak at 19.0 , negative peak at 69.5 .

     Strategy
     As noted in Section 7.2, it usually helps with compounds of known formula but unknown structure to calculate
     the compound's degree of unsaturation. In the present instance, a formula of C4H10O corresponds to a
     saturated, open-chain molecule.
     To gain information from the 13C data, let's begin by noting that the unknown alcohol has four carbon atoms, yet
     has only three NMR absorptions, which implies that two of the carbons must be equivalent. Looking at chemical
     shifts, two of the absorptions are in the typical alkane region (19.0 and 31.7 ), while one is in the region of a

13.13 Uses of 13C NMR Spectroscopy

The information derived from 13C NMR spectroscopy is extraordinarily useful for structure determination. Not
only can we count the number of nonequivalent carbon atoms in a molecule, we can also get information about
the electronic environment of each carbon and find how many protons are attached to each. As a result, we can
address many structural questions that go unanswered by IR spectroscopy or mass spectrometry.

Here's an example: how do we know that the E2 reaction of an alkyl halide follows Zaitsev's rule (Section 11.7)?
Does treatment of 1-chloro-1-methylcyclohexane with a strong base give predominantly the trisubstituted
alkene 1-methylcyclohexene or the disubstituted alkene methylenecyclohexane?

1-Methylcyclohexene will have five sp3-carbon resonances in the 20 to 50  range and two sp2-carbon
resonances in the 100 to 150  range. Methylenecyclohexane, however, because of its symmetry, will have only
three sp3-carbon resonance peaks and two sp2-carbon peaks. The spectrum of the actual reaction product,

shown in FIGURE 13.22, clearly identifies 1-methylcyclohexene as the product of this E2 reaction.

PROBLEM We saw in Section 9.3 that addition of HBr to a terminal alkyne leads to the Markovnikov addition

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

As practiced by organic chemists, NMR spectroscopy is a powerful method of structure determination. A small
amount of sample, typically a few milligrams or less, is dissolved in a small amount of solvent, the solution is
placed in a thin glass tube, and the tube is placed into the narrow (1-2 cm) gap between the poles of a strong
magnet. Imagine, though, that a much larger NMR instrument were available. Instead of a few milligrams, the
sample size could be tens of kilograms; instead of a narrow gap between magnet poles, the gap could be large
enough for a whole person to climb into so that an NMR spectrum of body parts could be obtained. That large
instrument is exactly what's used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a diagnostic technique of enormous
value to the medical community.
Like NMR spectroscopy, MRI takes advantage of the magnetic properties of certain nuclei, typically hydrogen,
and of the signals emitted when those nuclei are stimulated by radiofrequency energy. Unlike what happens
in NMR spectroscopy, though, MRI instruments use data manipulation techniques to look at the three-
dimensional location of magnetic nuclei in the body rather than at the chemical nature of the nuclei. As noted,
most MRI instruments currently look at hydrogen, present in abundance wherever there is water or fat in the
body.
The signals detected by MRI vary with the density of hydrogen atoms and with the nature of their surroundings,
allowing identification of different types of tissue and even allowing the visualization of motion. For example,
the volume of blood leaving the heart in a single stroke can be measured, and heart motion can be observed.
Soft tissues that don't show up well on X-ray images can be seen clearly, allowing diagnosis of brain tumors,
strokes, and other conditions. This technique is also valuable in diagnosing damage to knees or other joints and
is a noninvasive alternative to surgical explorations.
Several types of atoms in addition to hydrogen can be detected by MRI, and the applications of images based on
31P atoms are being explored. This approach holds great promise for studies of metabolism.

Summary

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or NMR, is the most valuable of the numerous spectroscopic
techniques used for structure determination. Although we focused in this chapter on NMR applications with
small molecules, more advanced NMR techniques are also used in biological chemistry to study protein
structure and folding.

When magnetic nuclei, such as 1H and 13C, are placed in a strong magnetic field, their spins orient either with
or against the field. On irradiation with radiofrequency (rf) waves, energy is absorbed and the nuclei "spin-flip"
from the lower energy state to the higher energy state. This absorption of rf energy is detected, amplified, and
displayed as an NMR spectrum.

Each electronically distinct 1H or 13C nucleus in a molecule comes into resonance at a slightly different value
of the applied field, thereby producing a unique absorption signal. The exact position of each peak is called the
chemical shift. Chemical shifts are caused by electrons setting up tiny local magnetic fields that shield a nearby
nucleus from the applied field.

The NMR chart is calibrated in delta units (), where 1  = 1 ppm of spectrometer frequency. Tetramethylsilane
(TMS) is used as a reference point because it shows both 1H and 13C absorptions at unusually high values of

applied magnetic field. The TMS absorption occurs on the right-hand (upfield) side of the chart and is arbitrarily
assigned a value of 0 .

13C spectra are run on Fourier-transform NMR (FT-NMR) spectrometers using broadband decoupling of proton
spins so that each chemically distinct carbon shows a single unsplit resonance line. As with 1H NMR, the
chemical shift of each 13C signal provides information about a carbon's chemical environment in the sample. In

addition, the number of protons attached to each carbon can be determined using the DEPT-NMR technique.

In 1H NMR spectra, the area under each absorption peak can be electronically integrated to determine the
relative number of hydrogens responsible for each peak. In addition, neighboring nuclear spins can couple,
causing the spin-spin splitting of NMR peaks into multiplets. The NMR signal of a hydrogen neighbored by n
equivalent adjacent hydrogens splits into n + 1 peaks (the n + 1 rule) with coupling constant J.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Conjugated compounds of many different sorts are common in nature. Many of the
pigments responsible for the brilliant colors of fruits, flowers, and even animals have numerous alternating
single and double bonds. -Carotene, for instance, the orange pigment responsible for the color of carrots and
an important source of vitamin A, is a conjugated polyene with 11 double bonds. Conjugated enones (alkene +
ketone) are common structural features of many biologically important molecules such as progesterone, the
hormone that prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertilized ovum. Cyclic conjugated molecules such as
benzene are a major field of study in themselves. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the distinctive properties
456  14 · Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     of conjugated molecules and at the reasons for those properties.

     Most of the unsaturated compounds we looked at in the chapters on Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity and
     Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis had only one double bond, but many compounds have numerous sites
     of unsaturation. If the different unsaturations are well separated in a molecule, they react independently,
     but if they're close together, they may interact. In particular, compounds that have alternating single and
     double bonds--so-called conjugated compounds--have some distinctive characteristics. The conjugated diene
     1,3-butadiene, for instance, has some properties quite different from those of the nonconjugated
     1,4-pentadiene.

     14.1 Stability of Conjugated Dienes: Molecular Orbital Theory

     Conjugated dienes can be prepared by some of the methods previously discussed for preparing alkenes (Section
     11.7-Section 11.11). The base-induced elimination of HX from an allylic halide is one such reaction.

     Simple conjugated dienes used in polymer synthesis include 1,3-butadiene, chloroprene
     (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), and isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). Isoprene has been prepared industrially by
     several methods, including the acid-catalyzed double dehydration of 3-methyl-1,3-butanediol.

One of the properties that distinguishes conjugated from nonconjugated dienes is that the central single bond is
shorter than might be expected. The C2-C3 single bond in 1,3-butadiene, for instance, has a length of 147 pm,
some 6 pm shorter than the C2-C3 bond in butane (153 pm).

Another distinctive property of conjugated dienes is their unusual stability, as evidenced by their heats of
hydrogenation (TABLE 14.1). We saw in Section 7.6 that monosubstituted alkenes, such as 1-butene, have

                near -126 kJ/mol (-30.1 kcal/mol), whereas disubstituted alkenes, such as 2-methylpropene, have
                near -119 kJ/mol (-28.4 kcal/mol), which is approximately 7 kJ/mol less negative. We concluded
from these data that more highly substituted alkenes are more stable than less substituted ones. That is, more
highly substituted alkenes release less heat on hydrogenation because they contain less energy to start with. A
similar conclusion can be drawn for conjugated dienes.

TABLE 14.1 Heats of Hydrogenation for Some Alkenes and Dienes

                                                             (kJ/mol) (kcal/mol)

                                                             -126  -30.1

                                                             -119  -28.4

                                                             -253  -60.5
                                                             -236  -56.4
                                                             -229  -54.7

Because a monosubstituted alkene has a           of approximately -126 kJ/mol, we might expect that a

compound with two monosubstituted double bonds would have a        approximately twice that value,

or -252 kJ/mol. Nonconjugated dienes, such as 1,4-pentadiene (                    ), meet this

expectation, but the conjugated diene 1,3-butadiene (              ) does not. 1,3-Butadiene is

approximately 16 kJ/mol (3.8 kcal/mol) more stable than expected.

What accounts for the stability of conjugated dienes? According to valence bond theory (Section 1.5 and Section

1.8), their stability is due to orbital hybridization. Typical C-C single bonds, like those in alkanes, result from
 overlap of sp3 orbitals on both carbons, but in a conjugated diene, the central C-C single bond results from
 overlap of sp2 orbitals on both carbons. Because sp2 orbitals have more s character (33% s) than sp3 orbitals
(25% s), the electrons in sp2 orbitals are closer to the nucleus and the bonds they form are somewhat shorter
458  14 · Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     and stronger. Thus, the "extra" stability of a conjugated diene results in part from the greater amount of s
     character in the orbitals forming the C-C single bond.

     According to molecular orbital theory (Section 1.11), the stability of conjugated dienes arises because of an
     interaction between the  orbitals of the two double bonds. To review briefly, when two p atomic orbitals
     combine to form a  bond, two  molecular orbitals (MOs) result. One is lower in energy than the starting p
     orbitals and is therefore bonding; the other is higher in energy, has a node between nuclei, and is antibonding.
     The two  electrons occupy the low-energy, bonding orbital, resulting in formation of a stable bond between
     atoms (FIGURE 14.2).

     FIGURE 14.2 Two p orbitals combine to form two  molecular orbitals. Both electrons occupy the low-energy, bonding orbital, leading to
     a net lowering of energy and formation of a stable bond. The asterisk on indicates an antibonding orbital.

     Now let's combine four adjacent p atomic orbitals, as occurs in a conjugated diene. In so doing, we generate a
     set of four  molecular orbitals, two of which are bonding and two of which are antibonding (FIGURE 14.3). The
     four  electrons occupy the two bonding orbitals, leaving the antibonding orbitals vacant.

     FIGURE 14.3 Four  molecular orbitals in 1,3-butadiene. Note that the number of nodes between nuclei increases as the energy level of
     the orbital increases.

The lowest-energy  molecular orbital (denoted 1, Greek psi) has no nodes between the nuclei and is therefore
bonding. The  MO of next-lowest energy, 2, has one node between nuclei and is also bonding. Above 1 and
2 in energy are the two antibonding  MOs, and . (The asterisks indicate antibonding orbitals.) Note
that the number of nodes between nuclei increases as the energy level of the orbital increases. The orbital
has two nodes between nuclei, and , the highest-energy MO, has three nodes between nuclei.

Comparing the  molecular orbitals of 1,3-butadiene (two conjugated double bonds) with those of
1,4-pentadiene (two isolated double bonds) shows why the conjugated diene is more stable. In a conjugated
diene, the lowest-energy  MO (1) has a favorable bonding interaction between C2 and C3 that is absent in
a nonconjugated diene. As a result, there is a certain amount of double-bond character to the C2-C3 single
bond, making that bond both stronger and shorter than a typical single bond. Electrostatic potential maps show
clearly the additional electron density in the central single bond (FIGURE 14.4).

FIGURE 14.4 Electrostatic potential maps of 1,3-butadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-pentadiene (nonconjugated). Additional electron
density is present in the central C-C bond of 1,3-butadiene, corresponding to partial double-bond character.

In describing 1,3-butadiene, we say that the  electrons are spread out, or delocalized, over the entire 
framework, rather than localized between two specific nuclei. Delocalization allows the bonding electrons to be
closer to more nuclei, thus leading to lower energy and greater stability.

        14-1 conjugated diene, a nonconjugated diene, and an allene in order of stability.

14.2 Electrophilic Additions to Conjugated Dienes: Allylic Carbocations

One of the most striking differences between conjugated dienes and typical alkenes is their behavior in
electrophilic addition reactions. To review briefly, the addition of an electrophile to a carbon-carbon double
bond is a general reaction of alkenes (Section 7.7). Markovnikov regiochemistry is observed because the
more stable carbocation is formed as an intermediate. Thus, addition of HCl to 2-methylpropene yields
2-chloro-2-methylpropane rather than 1-chloro-2-methylpropane, and addition of 2 equivalents of HCl to the
nonconjugated diene 1,4-pentadiene yields 2,4-dichloropentane.
460  14 · Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     Conjugated dienes also undergo electrophilic addition reactions readily, but mixtures of products are invariably
     obtained. Addition of HBr to 1,3-butadiene, for instance, yields a mixture of two products (not counting
     cis-trans isomers). 3-Bromo-1-butene is the typical Markovnikov product of 1,2-addition to a double bond, but
     1-bromo-2-butene seems unusual. The double bond in this product has moved to a position between carbons 2
     and 3, and HBr has added to carbons 1 and 4, a result described as 1,4-addition.

     Many other electrophiles besides HBr add to conjugated dienes, and mixtures of products are usually formed.
     For example, Br2 adds to 1,3-butadiene to give a mixture of 3,4-dibromo-1-butene and 1,4-dibromo-2-butene.

     How can we account for the formation of 1,4-addition products? The answer is that allylic carbocations are
     involved as intermediates (recall that the word allylic means "next to a double bond"). When 1,3-butadiene
     reacts with an electrophile such as H+, two carbocation intermediates are possible--a primary nonallylic
     carbocation and a secondary allylic cation. Because an allylic cation is stabilized by resonance between two
     forms (Section 11.5), it is more stable and forms faster than a nonallylic carbocation.

When the allylic cation reacts with Br- to complete the electrophilic addition, the reaction can occur either at C1
or at C3 because both carbons share the positive charge (FIGURE 14.5). Thus, a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-addition
products results. You might recall that a similar product mixture was seen for NBS bromination of alkenes in
Section 10.3, a reaction that proceeds through an allylic radical.

FIGURE 14.5 An electrostatic potential map of the allylic carbocation produced by protonation of 1,3-butadiene shows that the
positive charge is shared by carbons 1 and 3. Reaction of Br- with the more positive carbon (C3) predominantly yields the 1,2-addition
product.

Predicting the Product of an Electrophilic Addition Reaction of a Conjugated Diene

Give the structures of the likely products from reaction of 1 equivalent of HCl with
2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene. Show both 1,2 and 1,4 adducts.
Strategy
Electrophilic addition of HCl to a conjugated diene involves the formation of allylic carbocation intermediate.
Thus, the first step is to protonate the two ends of the diene and draw the resonance forms of the two allylic
carbocations that result. Then, allow each resonance form to react with Cl-, generating a maximum of four
possible products.
In the present instance, protonation of the C1-C2 double bond gives a carbocation that can react further to give
the 1,2 adduct 3-chloro-3-methylcyclohexene and the 1,4 adduct 3-chloro-1-methylcyclohexene. Protonation
of the C3-C4 double bond gives a symmetrical carbocation, whose two resonance forms are equivalent. Thus,
the 1,2 adduct and the 1,4 adduct have the same structure: 6-chloro-1-methylcyclohexene. Of the two possible
modes of protonation, the first is more likely because it yields a more stable, tertiary allylic cation rather than a
less-stable, secondary allylic cation.

     14.3 Kinetic versus Thermodynamic Control of Reactions

     Electrophilic addition to a conjugated diene at or below room temperature normally leads to a mixture of
     products in which the 1,2 adduct predominates over the 1,4 adduct. When the same reaction is carried out at
     higher temperatures, however, the product ratio often changes and the 1,4 adduct predominates. For example,
     addition of HBr to 1,3-butadiene at 0 °C yields a 71 : 29 mixture of 1,2 and 1,4 adducts, but the same reaction
     carried out at 40 °C yields a 15 : 85 mixture. Furthermore, when the product mixture formed at 0 °C is heated to
     40 °C in the presence of HBr, the ratio of adducts slowly changes from 71 : 29 to 15 : 85. Why?

     To understand the effect of temperature on product distribution, let's briefly review what we said in Section 6.7
     about rates and equilibria. Imagine a reaction that can give either or both of two products, B and C.

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                          14.3 · Kinetic versus Thermodynamic Control of Reactions              463

Let's assume that B forms faster than C (in other words,  ) but that C is more stable than B (in

other words,  ). An energy diagram for the two processes might look like that shown in FIGURE

14.6.

FIGURE 14.6 An energy diagram for two competing reactions in which the less stable product B forms faster than the more stable
product C.

Let's first carry out the reaction at a lower temperature so that both processes are irreversible and no
equilibrium is reached. Because B forms faster than C, B is the major product. It doesn't matter that C is more
stable than B, because the two are not in equilibrium. The product of an irreversible reaction depends only on
relative rates, not on stability. Such reactions are said to be under kinetic control.

Now let's carry out the same reaction at some higher temperature so that both processes are readily reversible
and an equilibrium is reached. Because C is more stable than B, C is the major product obtained. It doesn't
matter that C forms more slowly than B, because the two are in equilibrium. The product of a readily reversible
reaction depends only on stability, not on relative rates. Such reactions are said to be under equilibrium control,
or thermodynamic control.

We can now explain the effect of temperature on the electrophilic addition reactions of conjugated dienes. At
low temperature (0 °C), HBr adds to 1,3-butadiene under kinetic control to give a 71 : 29 mixture of products,
with the more rapidly formed 1,2 adduct predominating. Because these low-temperature conditions don't allow
the reaction to reach equilibrium, the product that forms faster predominates. At higher temperature (40 °C),
however, the reaction occurs under thermodynamic control to give a 15 : 85 mixture of products, with the more
stable 1,4 adduct predominating. The higher temperature allows the addition process to become reversible, so
an equilibrium mixture of products results. FIGURE 14.7 shows this situation in an energy diagram.

     faster, but the 1,4 adduct is the thermodynamic product because it is more stable.

     The electrophilic addition of HBr to 1,3-butadiene is a good example of how a change in experimental
     conditions can change the product of a reaction. The concept of thermodynamic control versus kinetic control
     is a useful one that we can sometimes take advantage of in the laboratory.

     14.4 The Diels-Alder Cycloaddition Reaction

     Perhaps the most striking difference between conjugated and nonconjugated dienes is that conjugated dienes
     undergo an addition reaction with alkenes to yield substituted cyclohexene products. For example,
     1,3-butadiene and 3-buten-2-one give 3-cyclohexenyl methyl ketone.

     This process, named the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction after its discoverers, is extremely useful in the
     laboratory because it forms two carbon-carbon bonds in a single step and is one of the few general methods
     available for making cyclic molecules. (As the name implies, a cycloaddition reaction is one in which two
     reactants add together to give a cyclic product.) The 1950 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Otto Diels
     and Kurt Alder in recognition of the importance of their discovery.
     The mechanism of Diels-Alder cycloaddition is different from that of other reactions we've studied because it
     is neither polar nor radical. Rather, the Diels-Alder reaction is a pericyclic process. Pericyclic reactions, which
     we'll discuss in more detail in Chapter 30, take place in a single step by a cyclic redistribution of bonding
     electrons. The two reactants simply join together through a cyclic transition state in which the two new C-C
     bonds form at the same time.
     We can picture a Diels-Alder addition as occurring by head-on () overlap of the two alkene p orbitals with
     the two p orbitals on carbons 1 and 4 of the diene (FIGURE 14.8). This is, of course, a cyclic orientation of the
     reactants.

FIGURE 14.8 Mechanism of the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction. The reaction occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state in
which the two new C-C bonds form simultaneously.

In the Diels-Alder transition state, the two alkene carbons and carbons 1 and 4 of the diene rehybridize from
sp2 to sp3 to form two new single bonds, while carbons 2 and 3 of the diene remain sp2-hybridized to form the
new double bond in the cyclohexene product. We'll study this mechanism in more detail in Section 30.5 but will
concentrate for the present on learning about the characteristics and uses of the Diels-Alder reaction.

14.5 Characteristics of the Diels-Alder Reaction

The Dienophile

The Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction occurs most rapidly if the alkene component, called the dienophile
("diene lover"), has an electron-withdrawing substituent group. Thus, ethylene itself reacts sluggishly, but
propenal, ethyl propenoate, maleic anhydride, benzoquinone, propenenitrile, and similar compounds are
highly reactive. Note also that alkynes, such as methyl propynoate, can act as Diels-Alder dienophiles.

In all cases, the double or triple bond of the dienophile is adjacent to the positively polarized carbon of an
electron-withdrawing substituent. As a result, the double-bond carbons in these substances are substantially
less electron-rich than the carbons in ethylene, as indicated by the electrostatic potential maps in FIGURE 14.9.

     FIGURE 14.9 Electrostatic potential maps of ethylene, propenal, and propenenitrile show that electron-withdrawing groups make the
     double-bond carbons less electron-rich.

     One of the most useful features of the Diels-Alder reaction is that it is stereospecific, meaning that a single
     product stereoisomer is formed. Furthermore, the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. If we carry out
     cycloaddition with methyl cis-2-butenoate, only the cis-substituted cyclohexene product is formed. With methyl
     trans-2-butenoate, only the trans-substituted cyclohexene product is formed.

     Another stereochemical feature of the Diels-Alder reaction is that the diene and dienophile partners orient so
     that the endo product, rather than the alternative exo product, is formed. The words endo and exo are used to
     indicate relative stereochemistry when referring to bicyclic structures like substituted norbornanes (Section
     4.9). A substituent on one bridge is said to be endo if it is syn (cis) to the larger of the other two bridges and is
     said to be exo if it is anti (trans) to the larger of the other two.

     Endo products result from Diels-Alder reactions because the amount of orbital overlap between diene and
     dienophile is greater when the reactants lie directly on top of one another, so that the electron-withdrawing
     substituent on the dienophile is underneath the diene double bonds. In the reaction of 1,3-cyclopentadiene with
     maleic anhydride, for instance, the following result is obtained:

Predict the product of the following Diels-Alder reaction:

Strategy
Draw the diene so that the ends of its two double bonds are near the dienophile double bond. Then form two
single bonds between the partners, convert the three double bonds into single bonds, and convert the former
single bond of the diene into a double bond. Because the dienophile double bond is cis to begin with, the two
attached hydrogens must remain cis in the product.

The Diene

Just as the dienophile component has certain constraints that affect its reactivity, so too does the conjugated
diene component. The diene must adopt what is called an s-cis conformation, meaning "cis-like" about the
single bond, to undergo a Diels-Alder reaction. Only in the s-cis conformation are carbons 1 and 4 of the diene
close enough to react through a cyclic transition state.
468  14 · Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     In the alternative s-trans conformation, the ends of the diene partner are too far apart to overlap with the
     dienophile p orbitals.

     Two examples of dienes that can't adopt an s-cis conformation, and thus don't undergo Diels-Alder reactions,
     are shown in FIGURE 14.10. In the bicyclic diene, the double bonds are rigidly fixed in an s-trans arrangement
     by geometric constraints of the rings. In (2Z,4Z)-2,4-hexadiene, steric strain between the two methyl groups
     prevents the molecule from adopting s-cis geometry.

                   FIGURE 14.10 Two dienes that can't achieve an s-cis conformation and thus can't undergo Diels-Alder reactions.

     In contrast to these unreactive dienes that can't achieve an s-cis conformation, other dienes are fixed only in
     the correct s-cis geometry and are therefore highly reactive in Diels-Alder cycloaddition. 1,3-Cyclopentadiene,
     for example, is so reactive that it reacts with itself. At room temperature, 1,3-cyclopentadiene dimerizes. One
     molecule acts as diene and a second molecule acts as dienophile in a self-Diels-Alder reaction.

     Biological Diels-Alder reactions are also known but are uncommon. One example occurs in the biosynthesis
     of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin (trade name Mevacor) isolated from the bacterium Aspergillus
     terreus. The key step is the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction of a triene, in which the diene and dienophile
     components are within the same molecule.

14.6 Diene Polymers: Natural and Synthetic Rubbers

Conjugated dienes can be polymerized just as simple alkenes can (Section 8.10). Diene polymers are
structurally more complex than simple alkene polymers, however, because double bonds occur every four
carbon atoms along the chain, leading to the possibility of cis-trans isomers. The initiator (In) for the reaction
can be either a radical, as occurs in ethylene polymerization, or an acid. Note that the polymerization is a 1,4
addition of the growing chain to a conjugated diene monomer.

     Rubber is a naturally occurring diene polymer of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) and is produced by more
     than 400 different plants. The major source is the so-called rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, from which the
     crude material, called latex, is harvested as it drips from a slice made through the bark. The double bonds
     of rubber have Z stereochemistry, but gutta-percha, the E isomer of rubber, also occurs naturally. Harder and
     more brittle than rubber, gutta-percha has a variety of applications, including use in dental endodontics and as
     the covering on some golf balls.

     A number of different synthetic rubbers are produced commercially by diene polymerization. Both cis- and
     trans-polyisoprene can be made, and the synthetic rubber thus produced is similar to the natural material.
     Chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene) is polymerized to yield neoprene, an excellent, although expensive,
     synthetic rubber with good weather resistance. Neoprene is used in the production of industrial hoses and
     gloves, among other things.

     Both natural and synthetic rubbers are too soft and tacky to be useful until they are hardened by heating
     with elemental sulfur, a process called vulcanization. Vulcanization cross-links the rubber chains by forming
     carbon-sulfur bonds between them, thereby hardening and stiffening the polymer. The exact degree of
     hardening can be varied, yielding material soft enough for automobile tires or hard enough for bowling balls
     (ebonite).
     The unusual ability of rubber to stretch and then contract to its original shape is due to the irregular structure
     of the polymer chains caused by the double bonds. These double bonds introduce bends and kinks into the
     polymer chains, thereby preventing neighboring chains from nestling together. When stretched, the randomly
     coiled chains straighten out and orient along the direction of the pull but are kept from sliding over one another
     by the cross-links. When the tension is released, the polymer reverts to its original random state.

14.7 Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

As we've seen, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are
techniques of structure determination applicable to all organic molecules. In addition to these three generally
useful methods, there is a fourth--ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy--that is applicable only to conjugated
compounds. UV is less commonly used than the other three spectroscopic techniques because of the specialized
information it gives, so we'll only discuss it briefly.

Mass spectrometry  Molecular size and formula
IR spectroscopy    Functional groups present
NMR spectroscopy   Carbon-hydrogen framework
UV spectroscopy    Conjugated  electron systems

The ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum extends from the short-wavelength end of the visible
region (4 × 10-7 m) to the long-wavelength end of the X-ray region (10-8 m), but the narrow range from 2 ×
10-7 m to 4 × 10-7 m is the part of greatest interest to organic chemists. Absorptions in this region are usually
measured in nanometers (nm), where 1 nm = 10-9 m. Thus, the ultraviolet range of interest is from 200 to 400

nm (FIGURE 14.11).

                            FIGURE 14.11 The ultraviolet (UV) and neighboring regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

We saw in Section 12.5 that when an organic molecule is irradiated with electromagnetic energy, the radiation
either passes through the sample or is absorbed, depending on its energy. With IR irradiation, the energy
absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to increase molecular vibrations. With UV radiation, the energy
absorbed corresponds to the amount needed to promote an electron from a lower-energy orbital to a higher-
energy one in a conjugated molecule. The conjugated diene 1,3-butadiene, for instance, has four  molecular
orbitals, as shown previously in FIGURE 14.3. The two lower-energy, bonding MOs are occupied in the ground
state, and the two higher-energy, antibonding MOs are unoccupied.

On irradiation with ultraviolet light (h), 1,3-butadiene absorbs energy and a  electron is promoted from the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Because
the electron is promoted from a bonding  molecular orbital to an antibonding * molecular orbital, we call this
a   * excitation (read as "pi to pi star"). The energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO of 1,3-butadiene
is such that UV light of 217 nm wavelength is required to effect the   * electronic transition (FIGURE 14.12).
472  14 · Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     FIGURE 14.12 Ultraviolet excitation of 1,3-butadiene results in the promotion of an electron from 2, the highest occupied molecular
     orbital (HOMO), to 3*, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).

     An ultraviolet spectrum is recorded by irradiating a sample with UV light of continuously changing wavelength.
     When the wavelength corresponds to the energy level required to excite an electron to a higher level, energy
     is absorbed. This absorption is detected and displayed on a chart that plots wavelength versus absorbance (A),
     defined as

     where I0 is the intensity of the incident light and I is the intensity of the light transmitted through the sample.
     Note that UV spectra differ from IR spectra in how they are presented. For historical reasons, IR spectra are
     usually displayed so that the baseline corresponding to zero absorption runs across the top of the chart and a
     valley indicates an absorption, whereas UV spectra are displayed with the baseline at the bottom of the chart so
     that a peak indicates an absorption (FIGURE 14.13).

     The amount of UV light absorbed is expressed as the sample's molar absorptivity (), defined by the equation

     where

the range  = 10,000 to 25,000. The units for molar absorptivity, L/(mol · cm), are usually dropped.

A particularly important use of this equation comes from rearranging it to the form c = A/( · l), which lets us
measure the concentration of a sample in solution when A, , and l are known. As an example, -carotene, the
pigment responsible for the orange color of carrots, has  = 138,000 L/(mol · cm). If a sample of -carotene
is placed in a cell with a pathlength of 1.0 cm and the UV absorbance reads 0.37, then the concentration of
-carotene in the sample is

Unlike IR and NMR spectra, which show many absorptions for a given molecule, UV spectra are usually quite

simple--often only a single peak. The peak is usually broad, and we identify its position by noting the
wavelength at the top of the peak--max, read as "lambda max."

PROBLEM Calculate the energy range of electromagnetic radiation in the UV region of the spectrum from 200
      14-13 to 400 nm (see Section 12.5). How does this value compare with the values calculated previously
                 for IR and NMR spectroscopy?

PROBLEM If pure vitamin A has max = 325 ( = 50,100), what is the vitamin A concentration in a sample whose
      14-14 absorbance at 325 nm is A = 0.735 in a cell with a pathlength of 1.00 cm?

14.8 Interpreting Ultraviolet Spectra: The Effect of Conjugation

The wavelength necessary to effect the   * transition in a conjugated molecule depends on the energy gap
between HOMO and LUMO, which in turn depends on the nature of the conjugated system. Thus, by measuring
the UV spectrum of an unknown, we can derive structural information about the nature of any conjugated 
electron system present in a molecule.

One of the most important factors affecting the wavelength of UV absorption by a molecule is the extent

of conjugation. Molecular orbital calculations show that the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO
decreases as the extent of conjugation increases. Thus, 1,3-butadiene absorbs at max = 217 nm,
1,3,5-hexatriene absorbs at max = 258 nm, and 1,3,5,7-octatetraene absorbs at max = 290 nm. (Remember:
longer wavelength means lower energy.)

Other kinds of conjugated systems, such as conjugated enones and aromatic rings, also have characteristic
UV absorptions that are useful in structure determination. The UV absorption maxima of some representative
conjugated molecules are given in TABLE 14.2.

     14.9 Conjugation, Color, and the Chemistry of Vision

     Why are some organic compounds colored while others are not? -Carotene, the pigment in carrots, is yellow-
     orange, for instance, while cholesterol is colorless. The answer involves both the chemical structures of colored
     molecules and the way we perceive light.
     The visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum is adjacent to the ultraviolet region, extending from
     approximately 400 to 800 nm. Colored compounds have such elaborate systems of conjugation that their "UV"
     absorptions extend into the visible region. -Carotene, for instance, has 11 double bonds in conjugation, and its
     absorption occurs at max = 455 nm (FIGURE 14.14).

FIGURE 14.14 Ultraviolet spectrum of -carotene, a conjugated molecule with 11 double bonds. The absorption occurs in the visible
region.

"White" light from the sun or from a lamp consists of all wavelengths in the visible region. When white light
strikes -carotene, the wavelengths from 400 to 500 nm (blue) are absorbed while all other wavelengths are
transmitted and can reach our eyes. We therefore see the white light with the blue removed, which we perceive
as a yellow-orange color for -carotene.
Conjugation is crucial not only for the colors we see in organic molecules but also for the light-sensitive
molecules on which our visual system is based. The key substance for vision is dietary -carotene, which
is converted to vitamin A by enzymes in the liver, oxidized to an aldehyde called 11-trans-retinal, and then
isomerized by a change in geometry of the C11-C12 double bond to produce 11-cis-retinal.

There are two main types of light-sensitive receptor cells in the retina of the human eye: rod cells and cone cells.
The 3 million or so rod cells are primarily responsible for seeing dim light and shades of gray, whereas the 100
million cone cells are responsible for seeing bright light and colors. In the rod cells of the eye, 11-cis-retinal
is converted into rhodopsin, a light-sensitive substance formed from the protein opsin and 11-cis-retinal.
When light strikes the rod cells, isomerization of the C11-C12 double bond occurs and trans-rhodopsin, called
metarhodopsin II, is produced. In the absence of light, this cis-trans isomerization takes approximately 1100
years, but in the presence of light, it occurs within 2 × 10-13 seconds! Isomerization of rhodopsin is
accompanied by a change in molecular geometry, which in turn causes a nerve impulse to be sent through the
optic nerve to the brain, where it is perceived as vision.
476  14 · Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     Metarhodopsin II is then recycled back into rhodopsin by a multistep sequence involving cleavage to
     all-trans-retinal and cis-trans isomerization back to 11-cis-retinal.

Photolithography

Fifty years ago, someone interested in owning a computer would have paid approximately $150,000 for 16
megabytes of random-access memory that would have occupied a volume the size of a small desk. Today,
anyone can buy 60 times as much computer memory for $10 and fit the small chip into their shirt pocket. The
difference between then and now is due to improvements in photolithography, the process by which integrated-
circuit chips are made.
Photolithography begins by coating a layer of SiO2 onto a silicon wafer and further coating with a thin (0.5-1.0
m) film of a light-sensitive organic polymer called a resist. A mask is then used to cover those parts of the chip
that will become a circuit, and the wafer is irradiated with UV light. The nonmasked sections of the polymer
undergo a chemical change when irradiated, which makes them more soluble than the masked, unirradiated
sections. On washing the irradiated chip with solvent, solubilized polymer is selectively removed from the
irradiated areas, exposing the SiO2 underneath. This SiO2 is then chemically etched away by reaction with
hydrofluoric acid, leaving behind a pattern of polymer-coated SiO2. Further washing removes the remaining
polymer, leaving a positive image of the mask in the form of exposed ridges of SiO2 (FIGURE 14.16). Additional
cycles of coating, masking, and etching then produce the completed chips.

Summary

The unsaturated compounds we've looked at previously have had only one double bond, but many compounds
have numerous sites of unsaturation, which gives them some distinctive properties. Many such compounds are
common in nature, including pigments and hormones.

A conjugated diene or other compound is one that contains alternating double and single bonds. One
characteristic of conjugated dienes is that they are more stable than their nonconjugated counterparts. This
stability can be explained by a molecular orbital description in which four p atomic orbitals combine to form
four  molecular orbitals. Only the two bonding orbitals are occupied; the two antibonding orbitals are
unoccupied. A  bonding interaction in the lowest-energy MO introduces some partial double-bond character
between carbons 2 and 3, thereby strengthening the C2-C3 bond and stabilizing the molecule.

Conjugated dienes undergo several reactions not observed for nonconjugated dienes. One is the 1,4-addition
of electrophiles. When a conjugated diene is treated with an electrophile such as HCl, 1,2- and 1,4-addition
products are formed. Both result from the same resonance-stabilized allylic carbocation intermediate and are
produced in varying amounts depending on the reaction conditions. The 1,2 adduct is usually formed faster and
is said to be the product of kinetic control. The 1,4 adduct is usually more stable and is said to be the product
of thermodynamic control.

Another reaction unique to conjugated dienes is Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Conjugated dienes react with
electron-poor alkenes (dienophiles) in a single step through a cyclic transition state to yield a cyclohexene
product. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning that only a single product stereoisomer is formed, and can
occur only if the diene is able to adopt an s-cis conformation.

Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy is a method of structure determination applicable specifically to conjugated
-electron systems. When a conjugated molecule is irradiated with ultraviolet light, energy absorption occurs
and a  electron is promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO). For 1,3-butadiene, radiation of max = 217 nm is required. The greater the extent of
conjugation, the less the energy needed and the longer the wavelength of radiation required.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? The reactivity of substituted aromatic compounds, more than that of any other class of
substances, is intimately tied to their exact structure. As a result, aromatic compounds provide an
extraordinarily sensitive probe for studying the relationship between structure and reactivity. We'll examine
this relationship here and in the following chapter, and we'll find that the lessons learned are applicable to all
other organic compounds, including important substances such as the nucleic acids that control our genetic
makeup.
In the early days of organic chemistry, the word aromatic was used to describe such fragrant substances as
benzaldehyde (from cherries, peaches, and almonds), toluene (from Tolu balsam), and benzene (from coal
distillate). It was soon realized, however, that substances grouped as aromatic differed from most other organic
compounds in their chemical behavior.
490  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     Today, the association of aromaticity with fragrance has long been lost, and we now use the word aromatic
     to refer to the class of compounds that contain six-membered rings with three alternating double bonds.
     Many naturally occurring compounds are aromatic in part, including steroids such as estrone and well-known
     pharmaceuticals such as the cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin, marketed as Lipitor. Benzene itself causes
     a depressed white blood cell count (leukopenia) on prolonged exposure and should not be used as a laboratory
     solvent.

     15.1 Naming Aromatic Compounds

     Simple aromatic hydrocarbons come from two main sources: coal and petroleum. Coal is an enormously
     complex mixture consisting primarily of large arrays of benzene-like rings joined together. Thermal breakdown
     of coal occurs when heated to 1000 °C in the absence of air, and a mixture of volatile products called coal tar
     boils off. Fractional distillation of coal tar yields benzene, toluene, xylene (dimethylbenzene), naphthalene, and
     a host of other aromatic compounds (FIGURE 15.2).

                                                         FIGURE 15.2 Some aromatic hydrocarbons found in coal tar.

     Unlike coal, petroleum contains few aromatic compounds and consists largely of alkanes (see Chapter 3
     Chemistry Matters). During petroleum refining, however, aromatic molecules are formed when alkanes are
     passed over a catalyst at about 500 °C under high pressure.
     Aromatic substances, more than any other class of organic compounds, have acquired a large number of
     nonsystematic names. IUPAC rules discourage the use of most such names but do allow some of the more widely
     used ones to be retained (TABLE 15.1). Thus, methylbenzene is known commonly as toluene; hydroxybenzene
     as phenol; aminobenzene as aniline; and so on.

Monosubstituted benzenes are named systematically in the same manner as other hydrocarbons, with
-benzene as the parent name. Thus, C6H5Br is bromobenzene, C6H5NO2 is nitrobenzene, and C6H5CH2CH2CH3
is propylbenzene.

Alkyl-substituted benzenes are sometimes referred to as arenes and are named in different ways depending
on the size of the alkyl group. If the alkyl substituent is smaller than the ring (six or fewer carbons), the
arene is referred to as an alkyl-substituted benzene. If the alkyl substituent is larger than the ring (seven or
more carbons), the compound is referred to as a phenyl-substituted alkane. The name phenyl, pronounced
fen-nil and sometimes abbreviated as Ph or  (Greek phi), is used for the -C6H5 unit when the benzene ring
492  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     is considered a substituent. The word is derived from the Greek pheno ("I bear light"), commemorating the
     discovery of benzene by Michael Faraday in 1825 from the oily residue left by the illuminating gas used in
     London street lamps. In addition, the name benzyl is used for the C6H5CH2- group.

     Disubstituted benzenes are named using the prefixes ortho (o), meta (m), or para (p). An ortho-disubstituted
     benzene has its two substituents in a 1,2 relationship on the ring, a meta-disubstituted benzene has its two
     substituents in a 1,3 relationship, and a para-disubstituted benzene has its substituents in a 1,4 relationship.

     The ortho, meta, para system of nomenclature is also useful when discussing reactions. For example, we might
     describe the reaction of bromine with toluene by saying, "Reaction occurs at the para position," meaning at the
     position para to the methyl group already present on the ring.

     As with cycloalkanes (Section 4.1), benzenes with more than two substituents are named by choosing a point
     of attachment as carbon 1 and numbering the substituents on the ring so that the second substituent has as
     low a number as possible. If ambiguity still exists, number so that the third or fourth substituent has as low a
     number as possible, until a point of difference is found. The substituents are listed alphabetically when writing
     the name.

     Note in the second and third examples shown that -phenol and -toluene are used as the parent names rather
     than -benzene. Any of the monosubstituted aromatic compounds shown in TABLE 15.1 can serve as a parent
     name, with the principal substituent (-OH in phenol or -CH3 in toluene) attached to C1 on the ring.

15.2 Structure and Stability of Benzene

Benzene (C6H6) has six fewer hydrogens than the six-carbon cycloalkane cyclohexane (C6H12) and is clearly
unsaturated, usually being represented as a six-membered ring with alternating double and single bonds.
Yet it has been known since the mid-1800s that benzene is much less reactive than typical alkenes and fails
to undergo typical alkene addition reactions. Cyclohexene, for instance, reacts rapidly with Br2 and gives
the addition product 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, but benzene reacts slowly with Br2 and gives the substitution
product C6H5Br rather than the addition product.

We can get a quantitative idea of benzene's stability by measuring heats of hydrogenation (Section 7.6).

Cyclohexene, an isolated alkene, has                         (-28.2 kcal/mol), and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, a

conjugated diene, has                      (-55.0 kcal/mol). As noted in Section 14.1, this value for

1,3-cyclohexadiene is a bit less than twice that for cyclohexene because conjugated dienes are more stable than

isolated dienes.

Carrying the process one step further, we might expect             for "cyclohexatriene" (benzene) to be a bit

less than 3 × 118 = 354 kJ/mol, or three times the cyclohexene value. The actual value, however, is -206 kJ/

mol, some 148 kJ/mol (35.4 kcal/mol) less than expected. Because of this difference in actual and expected

energy released during hydrogenation, benzene must have 148 kJ/mol less energy to begin with. In other words,

benzene is more stable than expected by 148 kJ/mol (FIGURE 15.3).
494  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     FIGURE 15.3 A comparison of the heats of hydrogenation for cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, and benzene. Benzene is 148 kJ/mol
     (35.4 kcal/mol) more stable than might be expected for "cyclohexatriene."

     Further evidence for the unusual nature of benzene is that all its carbon-carbon bonds have the same
     length--139 pm, which is intermediate between typical single (154 pm) and double (134 pm) bonds. In addition,
     an electrostatic potential map shows that the electron density in all six C-C bonds is identical. Thus, benzene is
     a planar molecule with the shape of a regular hexagon. All C-C-C bond angles are 120°, all six carbon atoms are
     sp2-hybridized, and each carbon has a p orbital perpendicular to the plane of the six-membered ring.

     Because all six carbon atoms and all six p orbitals in benzene are equivalent, it's impossible to define three
     localized  bonds in which a given p orbital overlaps only one neighboring p orbital. Rather, each p orbital
     overlaps equally well with both neighboring p orbitals, leading to a picture of benzene in which all six 
     electrons are free to move about the entire ring (FIGURE 15.4b). In resonance terms (Section 2.4 and Section
     2.5), benzene is a hybrid of two equivalent forms. Neither form is correct by itself; the true structure of benzene
     is somewhere in between the two resonance forms but is impossible to draw with our usual conventions.
     Because of this resonance, benzene is more stable and less reactive than a typical alkene.

     FIGURE 15.4 (a) An electrostatic potential map of benzene and (b) an orbital picture. Each of the six carbon atoms has a p orbital that can
     overlap equally well with neighboring p orbitals on both sides. As a result, all C-C bonds are equivalent and benzene must be represented as
     a hybrid of two resonance forms.

     Chemists sometimes represent the two benzene resonance forms by using a circle to indicate the equivalence
     of the carbon-carbon bonds, but this representation has to be used carefully because it doesn't indicate the
     number of  electrons in the ring. (How many electrons does a circle represent?) In this book, benzene and

other aromatic compounds will be represented by single line-bond structures. We'll be able to keep count of 
electrons this way but must be aware of the limitations of the drawings.

Having just seen a resonance description of benzene, let's now look at the alternative molecular orbital

description. We can construct  molecular orbitals for benzene just as we did for 1,3-butadiene in Section 14.1.

If six p atomic orbitals combine in a cyclic manner, six benzene molecular orbitals result, as shown in FIGURE
15.5. The three low-energy molecular orbitals, denoted 1, 2, and 3, are bonding combinations, and the three
high-energy orbitals are antibonding.

FIGURE 15.5 The six benzene  molecular orbitals. The bonding orbitals 2 and 3 have the same energy and are said to be degenerate,
as are the antibonding orbitals 4* and 5*. The orbitals 3 and 4* have no  electron density on two carbons because of a node passing
through these atoms.

Note that the two bonding orbitals 2 and 3 have the same energy, as do the two antibonding orbitals
and . Such orbitals with the same energy are said to be degenerate. Note also that the two orbitals 3 and

      have nodes passing through ring carbon atoms, thereby leaving no  electron density on these carbons.
The six p electrons of benzene occupy the three bonding molecular orbitals and are delocalized over the entire
conjugated system, leading to the observed 150 kJ/mol stabilization of benzene.

PROBLEM Pyridine is a flat, hexagonal molecule with bond angles of 120°. It undergoes substitution rather
        15-4 than addition and generally behaves like benzene. Draw a picture of the  orbitals of pyridine to
                 explain its properties. Check your answer by looking ahead to Section 15.5.

15.3 Aromaticity and the Hückel 4n + 2 Rule

Let's list what we've said thus far about benzene and, by extension, about other benzene-like aromatic
molecules.

  · Benzene is cyclic and conjugated.
  · Benzene is unusually stable, having a heat of hydrogenation 150 kJ/mol less negative than we might expect

      for a conjugated cyclic triene.
496  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

       · Benzene is planar and has the shape of a regular hexagon. All bond angles are 120°, all carbon atoms are
          sp2-hybridized, and all carbon-carbon bond lengths are 139 pm.

       · Benzene undergoes substitution reactions that retain the cyclic conjugation rather than electrophilic
           addition reactions that would destroy it.

       · Benzene can be described as a resonance hybrid whose structure is intermediate between two line-bond
           structures.

     This list might seem to be a good description of benzene and other aromatic molecules, but it isn't enough.
     Something else, called the Hückel 4n + 2 rule, is needed to complete a description of aromaticity. According to
     a theory devised in 1931 by the German physicist Erich Hückel, a molecule is aromatic only if it has a planar,
     monocyclic system of conjugation and contains a total of 4n + 2  electrons, where n is an integer (n = 0, 1,
     2, 3,). In other words, only molecules with 2, 6, 10, 14, 18,  electrons can be aromatic. Molecules with 4n 
     electrons (4, 8, 12, 16,) can't be aromatic, even though they may be cyclic, planar, and apparently conjugated.
     In fact, planar, conjugated molecules with 4n  electrons are said to be antiaromatic because delocalization of
     their  electrons would lead to their destabilization.

     Let's look at several examples to see how the Hückel 4n + 2 rule works.

       · Cyclobutadiene has four  electrons and is antiaromatic. As indicated by the electrostatic potential map,
          the  electrons are localized in two double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring.

        Cyclobutadiene is highly reactive and shows none of the properties associated with aromaticity. In fact, it
        was not even prepared until 1965, when Rowland Pettit at the University of Texas was able to make it at
        low temperature. Even at -78 °C, however, cyclobutadiene is so reactive that it dimerizes by a Diels-Alder
        reaction. One molecule behaves as a diene and the other as a dienophile.

     · Benzene has six  electrons (4n + 2 = 6 when n = 1) and is aromatic.

     · Cyclooctatetraene has eight  electrons, but when it was first prepared in 1911 by the German chemist
        Richard Willstätter, it was found not to be particularly stable. In fact, its  electrons are localized into four
        double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar.
        It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring p orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for
        overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.

15.4 · Aromatic Ions                                                                                                                       497

X-ray studies show that the C-C single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds
are 134 pm long. In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum shows a single sharp resonance line at 5.78 , a value
characteristic of an alkene rather than an aromatic molecule.

What's so special about 4n + 2  electrons? Why do 2, 6, 10, 14  electrons lead to aromatic stability, while
other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels
of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single
lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular
orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill
each of n succeeding energy levels--a total of 4n + 2. Any other number would leave an energy level partially
filled.

The six  molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are
shown again in FIGURE 15.6. The lowest-energy MO, 1, occurs singly and contains two electrons. The next two
lowest-energy orbitals, 2 and 3, are degenerate, and it therefore takes four electrons to fill both. The result is
a stable six--electron aromatic molecule with filled bonding orbitals.

FIGURE 15.6 Energy levels of the six benzene  molecular orbitals. There is a single, lowest-energy orbital, above which the orbitals come
in degenerate pairs.

PROBLEM To be aromatic, a molecule must have 4n + 2  electrons and must have a planar, monocyclic system
        15-5 of conjugation. Cyclodecapentaene fulfills one of these criteria but not the other and has resisted all
                 attempts at synthesis. Explain.

15.4 Aromatic Ions

According to the Hückel criteria for aromaticity, a molecule must be cyclic, conjugated (nearly planar with a p
orbital on each atom), and have 4n + 2  electrons. Nothing in this definition says that the number of  electrons
must be the same as the number of atoms in the ring or that the substance must be neutral. In fact, the numbers
can differ and the substance can be an ion. Thus, both the cyclopentadienyl anion and the cycloheptatrienyl
cation are aromatic even though both are ions and neither contains a six-membered ring.
498  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     To understand why the cyclopentadienyl anion and the cycloheptatrienyl cation are aromatic, imagine starting
     from the related neutral hydrocarbons, 1,3-cyclopentadiene and 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene, and removing one
     hydrogen from the saturated CH2 carbon in each. If that carbon then rehybridizes from sp3 to sp2, the resultant
     products would be fully conjugated, with a p orbital on every carbon. There are three ways in which the
     hydrogen might be removed.

       · The hydrogen can be removed with both electrons (H:-) from the C-H bond, leaving a carbocation as
           product.

       · The hydrogen can be removed with one electron (H·) from the C-H bond, leaving a carbon radical as
           product.

       · The hydrogen can be removed with no electrons (H+) from the C-H bond, leaving a carbanion as product.

     All the potential products formed by removing a hydrogen from 1,3-cyclopentadiene and from
     1,3,5-cycloheptatriene can be drawn with numerous resonance structures, but Hückel's rule predicts that only
     the six--electron cyclopentadienyl anion and cycloheptatrienyl cation can be aromatic. The other products are
     predicted by the 4n + 2 rule to be unstable and antiaromatic (FIGURE 15.7).

     FIGURE 15.7 The aromatic six--electron cyclopentadienyl anion and the six--electron cycloheptatrienyl cation. The anion can be
     formed by removing a hydrogen ion (H+) from the CH2 group of 1,3-cyclopentadiene. The cation can be generated by removing a hydride ion
     (H:-) from the CH2 group of 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene.

     In practice, both the four--electron cyclopentadienyl cation and the five--electron cyclopentadienyl radical
     are highly reactive and difficult to prepare. Neither shows any sign of the stability expected for an aromatic
     system. The six--electron cyclopentadienyl anion, by contrast, is easily prepared and remarkably stable
     (FIGURE 15.8a). In fact, the anion is so stable and easily formed that 1,3-cyclopentadiene is one of the most
     acidic hydrocarbons known, with pKa = 16, a value comparable to that of water!
     In the same way, the seven--electron cycloheptatrienyl radical and eight--electron anion are reactive and
     difficult to prepare, while the six--electron cycloheptatrienyl cation is extraordinarily stable (FIGURE 15.8b).

In fact, the cycloheptatrienyl cation was first prepared more than a century ago by reaction of
1,3,5-cycloheptatriene with Br2, although its structure was not recognized at the time.

PROBLEM Cyclooctatetraene readily reacts with potassium metal to form the stable cyclooctatetraene dianion,

PROBLEM       The relative energy levels of the five  molecular orbitals of the cyclopentadienyl system are similar
        15-8  to those in benzene. That is, there is a single lowest-energy MO, above which the orbitals come in
              degenerate pairs. Draw a diagram like that in Figure 15.6, and tell which of the five orbitals are
              occupied in the cation, radical, and anion.

15.5 Aromatic Heterocycles: Pyridine and Pyrrole

Look back once again at the definition of aromaticity in Section 15.3: a cyclic, conjugated molecule containing
4n + 2  electrons. Nothing in this definition says that the atoms in the ring must be carbon. In fact, heterocyclic
compounds can also be aromatic. A heterocycle is a cyclic compound that contains atoms of more than one
element in its ring, usually carbon along with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. Pyridine and pyrimidine, for example,
are six-membered heterocycles with carbon and nitrogen in their rings (FIGURE 15.9).
500  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     FIGURE 15.9 Pyridine and pyrimidine are nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles with  electron arrangements like that of
     benzene. Both have a lone pair of electrons on nitrogen in an sp2 orbital in the plane of the ring.

     Pyridine is much like benzene in its  electron structure. Each of the five sp2-hybridized carbons has a p orbital
     perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each p orbital contains one  electron. The nitrogen atom is also
     sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p orbital, bringing the total to six  electrons. The nitrogen lone-pair
     electrons (red in an electrostatic potential map) are in a sp2 orbital in the plane of the ring and are not part of the
     aromatic  system. Pyrimidine, also shown in FIGURE 15.9), is a benzene analog that has two nitrogen atoms in
     a six-membered, unsaturated ring. Both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized, and each contributes one electron to the
     aromatic  system.

     Pyrrole (spelled with two r's and one l) and imidazole are five-membered heterocycles, yet both have six 
     electrons and are aromatic. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one  electron and
     the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom contributes the two from its lone pair, which occupies a p orbital (FIGURE
     15.10). Imidazole, also shown in (FIGURE 15.10, is an analog of pyrrole that has two nitrogen atoms in a five-
     membered, unsaturated ring. Both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized, but one is in a double bond and contributes
     only one electron to the aromatic  system whereas the other is not in a double bond and contributes two from
     its lone pair.

     FIGURE 15.10 Pyrrole and imidazole are five-membered, nitrogen-containing heterocycles but have six--electron arrangements like
     that of the cyclopentadienyl anion. Both have a lone pair of electrons on nitrogen in a p orbital perpendicular to the ring.

Note that nitrogen atoms have different roles depending on the structure of the molecule. The nitrogen atoms
in pyridine and pyrimidine are both in double bonds and contribute only one  electron to the aromatic sextet,
just as a carbon atom in benzene does. The nitrogen atom in pyrrole, however, is not in a double bond and
contributes two  electrons (its lone pair) to the aromatic sextet. In imidazole, both kinds of nitrogen are present
in the same molecule--a double-bonded "pyridine-like" nitrogen that contributes one  electron and a "pyrrole-
like" nitrogen that contributes two.

Pyrimidine and imidazole rings are particularly important in biological chemistry. Pyrimidine, for instance,
is the parent ring system in cytosine, thymine, and uracil, three of the five heterocyclic amine bases found in
nucleic acids. An aromatic imidazole ring is present in histidine, one of the 20 amino acids found in proteins.

     15.6 Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds

     The Hückel rule is strictly applicable only to monocyclic compounds, but the general concept of aromaticity
     can be extended to include polycyclic aromatic compounds. Naphthalene, with two benzene-like rings fused
     together; anthracene, with three rings; benzo[a]pyrene, with five rings; and coronene, with six rings, are all
     well-known aromatic hydrocarbons. Benzo[a]pyrene is particularly interesting because it is one of the cancer-
     causing substances found in tobacco smoke.

     All polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be represented by a number of different resonance forms.
     Naphthalene, for instance, has three.

     Naphthalene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons show many of the chemical properties associated
     with aromaticity. Thus, measurement of its heat of hydrogenation shows an aromatic stabilization energy of
     approximately 250 kJ/mol (60 kcal/mol). Furthermore, naphthalene reacts slowly with electrophiles such as Br2
     to give substitution products rather than double-bond addition products.

     The aromaticity of naphthalene is explained by the orbital picture in FIGURE 15.11. Naphthalene has a cyclic,
     conjugated  electron system, with p orbital overlap both along the ten-carbon periphery of the molecule and
     across the central bond. Because ten  electrons is a Hückel number, there is  electron delocalization and
     consequent aromaticity in naphthalene.

throughout both rings.

Just as there are heterocyclic analogs of benzene, there are also many heterocyclic analogs of naphthalene.
Among the most common are quinoline, isoquinoline, indole, and purine. Quinoline, isoquinoline, and purine
all contain pyridine-like nitrogens that are part of a double bond and contribute one electron to the aromatic 
system. Indole and purine both contain pyrrole-like nitrogens that contribute two  electrons.

Among the many biological molecules that contain polycyclic aromatic rings, the amino acid tryptophan
contains an indole ring and the antimalarial drug quinine contains a quinoline ring. Adenine and guanine, two
of the five heterocyclic amine bases found in nucleic acids, have rings based on purine.

15.7 Spectroscopy of Aromatic Compounds

Infrared Spectroscopy

As we saw in the brief introduction to infrared spectroscopy (Section 12.8), aromatic rings show a characteristic
C-H stretching absorption at 3030 cm-1 and a series of peaks in the 1450 to 1600 cm-1 range of the infrared
spectrum. The aromatic C-H band at 3030 cm-1 generally has low intensity and occurs just to the left of a typical
saturated C-H band.
504  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     As many as four absorptions are sometimes observed in the 1450 to 1600 cm-1 region because of the complex
     molecular motions of the ring itself. Two bands, one at 1500 cm-1 and one at 1600 cm-1, are usually the most
     intense. In addition, aromatic compounds show weak absorptions in the 1660 to 2000 cm-1 region and strong
     absorptions in the 690 to 900 cm-1 range due to C-H out-of-plane bending. The exact position of both sets of

     absorptions is diagnostic of the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring (FIGURE 12.24 in Section 12.8).

     Monosubstituted:  690-710 cm-1   1,2,4-Trisubstituted:  780-830 cm-1
                       730-770 cm-1   1,2,3-Trisubstituted:  870-900 cm-1
     o-Disubstituted:  735-770 cm-1   1,3,5-Trisubstituted:  670-720 cm-1
     m-Disubstituted:  690-710 cm-1                          750-790 cm-1
                       810-850 cm-1                          660-700 cm-1
     p-Disubstituted:  810-840 cm-1                          830-900 cm-1

     The IR spectrum of toluene in FIGURE 15.12 shows these characteristic absorptions.

                                                                 FIGURE 15.12 The infrared spectrum of toluene.

     Ultraviolet Spectroscopy

     Aromatic rings are detectable by ultraviolet spectroscopy because they contain a conjugated  electron system.
     In general, aromatic compounds show a series of bands, with a fairly intense absorption near 205 nm and a less
     intense absorption in the 255 to 275 nm range. The presence of these bands in the ultraviolet spectrum of a
     molecule is a sure indication of an aromatic ring. FIGURE 15.13 shows the ultraviolet spectrum of benzene.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

Aromatic hydrogens are strongly deshielded by the ring and absorb between 6.5 and 8.0 . The spins of
nonequivalent aromatic protons on substituted rings often couple with each other, giving rise to spin-spin
splitting patterns that can identify the substitution of the ring.
Much of the difference in chemical shift between aromatic protons (6.5-8.0 ) and vinylic protons (4.5-6.5 )
is due to a property of aromatic rings called ring-current. When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular
to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This
induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring
(FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field
and come into resonance at a lower applied field.

FIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized 
electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.

Note that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring. If a ring were large
enough to have both "inside" and "outside" protons, the protons on the outside would be deshielded and absorb
506  15 · Benzene and Aromaticity

     at a field lower than normal but those on the inside would be shielded and absorb at a field higher than normal.
     This prediction has been strikingly confirmed by studies on [18]annulene, an 18--electron cyclic conjugated
     polyene that contains a Hückel number of electrons (4n + 2 = 18 when n = 4). The six inside protons of
     [18]annulene are strongly shielded by the aromatic ring-current and absorb at -3.0  (that is, 3.0 ppm upfield
     from TMS, off the normal chart), while the 12 outside protons are strongly deshielded and absorb in the typical
     aromatic region at 9.3 ppm downfield from TMS.

     The presence of a ring-current is characteristic of all Hückel aromatic molecules and is a good test of
     aromaticity. For example, benzene, a six--electron aromatic molecule, absorbs at 7.37  because of its ring-
     current, but cyclooctatetraene, an eight--electron nonaromatic molecule, absorbs at 5.78 .
     Hydrogens on carbon next to aromatic rings--benzylic hydrogens--also show distinctive absorptions in the NMR
     spectrum. Benzylic protons normally absorb downfield from other alkane protons in the region from 2.3 to 3.0
     .

     The 1H NMR spectrum of p-bromotoluene, shown in FIGURE 15.15, displays many of the features just
     discussed. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 7.04 and 7.37 , and the benzylic methyl protons
     absorb as a sharp singlet at 2.26 . Integration of the spectrum shows the expected 2 : 2 : 3 ratio of peak areas.

carbons but occur in the same range as alkene carbons. Thus, the presence of 13C absorptions at 110 to 140 

does not by itself establish the presence of an aromatic ring. Supporting evidence from infrared, ultraviolet, or
1H NMR spectra is needed.

Aspirin, NSAIDs, and COX-2 Inhibitors

Whatever the cause--whether tennis elbow, a sprained ankle, or a wrenched knee--pain and inflammation
seem to go together. They are, however, different in their origin, and powerful drugs are available for treating
each separately. Codeine, for example, is a powerful analgesic, or pain reliever, used in the management of
debilitating pain, while cortisone and related steroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents, used for treating
arthritis and other crippling inflammations. For minor pains and inflammation, both problems are often
treated together by using a common over-the-counter medication called an NSAID, or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug.
One of the most common NSAIDs is aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, whose use goes back to the late 1800s. It had
been known from before the time of Hippocrates in 400 BC that fevers could be lowered by chewing the bark
of willow trees. The active agent in willow bark was found in 1827 to be an aromatic compound called salicin,
which could be converted by reaction with water into salicyl alcohol and then oxidized to give salicylic acid.
Salicylic acid turned out to be even more effective than salicin for reducing fevers and to have analgesic and
anti-inflammatory action as well. Unfortunately, it also turned out to be too corrosive to the walls of the stomach
for everyday use. Conversion of the phenol -OH group into an acetate ester, however, yielded acetylsalicylic acid,
which proved just as potent as salicylic acid but less corrosive to the stomach.

Although extraordinary in its effect, aspirin is also more dangerous than commonly believed. 15 g of aspirin
would be fatal to a child of 9-10 years, and 10 g would be lethal for a 6-year-old, and aspirin can cause stomach
bleeding and allergic reactions in long-term users. Even more serious is a condition called Reye's syndrome,
a potentially fatal reaction to aspirin sometimes seen in children recovering from the flu. As a result of these
problems, numerous other NSAIDs have been developed in the last several decades, most notably ibuprofen and
naproxen.

Like aspirin, both ibuprofen and naproxen are relatively simple aromatic compounds containing a side-chain
carboxylic acid group. Ibuprofen, sold under the brand names Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, and others, has roughly
the same potency as aspirin but is less prone to causing an upset stomach. Naproxen, sold under the names
Aleve and Naprosyn, also has about the same potency as aspirin but remains active in the body six times longer.

Aspirin and other NSAIDs function by blocking the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that carry out the body's
synthesis of prostaglandins (Section 8.11 and Section 27.4). There are two forms of the enzyme: COX-1, which
carries out the normal physiological production of prostaglandins, and COX-2, which mediates the body's
response to arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Unfortunately, both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes are
blocked by aspirin, ibuprofen, and other NSAIDs, thereby shutting down not only the response to inflammation
but also various protective functions, including the control mechanism for production of acid in the stomach.
Medicinal chemists have therefore devised a number of drugs that act as selective inhibitors of only the COX-2
enzyme. Inflammation is thereby controlled without blocking protective functions. Originally heralded as a
breakthrough in arthritis treatment, the first generation of COX-2 inhibitors, including rofecoxib, (marketed as
Vioxx), celecoxib, (marketed as Celebrex), and Valdecoxib (marketed as Bextra), turned out to cause potentially
serious heart problems, particularly in elderly or compromised patients. As a result, all three Cox-2 inhibitors
were removed from the U.S. and other markets. Further studies, however, concluded that in proper doses the
Cox-2 inhibitors were little different from other NSAIDs, and Vioxx returned to the market in 2017 for topical
treatment of osteoarthritis.

Summary

Aromatic rings are a common part of many biological structures and are particularly important in nucleic
acid chemistry and in the chemistry of several amino acids. In this chapter, we've seen how and why aromatic
compounds are different from such apparently related compounds as cycloalkenes.

The word aromatic is used for historical reasons to refer to the class of compounds related structurally to
benzene. Aromatic compounds are systematically named according to IUPAC rules, but many common names
510 15 · Additional Problems

are also used. Disubstituted benzenes are referred to as ortho (1,2 disubstituted), meta (1,3 disubstituted), or

para (1,4 disubstituted) derivatives. The  unit itself is referred to as a phenyl group, and the

unit is a benzyl group.

Benzene is described by valence-bond theory as a resonance hybrid of two equivalent structures and is
described by molecular orbital theory as a planar, cyclic, conjugated molecule with six  electrons. According to
the Hückel rule, a molecule must have 4n + 2  electrons, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, to be aromatic. Planar,
cyclic, conjugated molecules with other numbers of  electrons are antiaromatic.

Other substances besides benzene-like compounds are also aromatic. The cyclopentadienyl anion and the
cycloheptatrienyl cation, for instance, are aromatic ions. Pyridine and pyrimidine are six-membered, nitrogen-
containing, aromatic heterocycles. Pyrrole and imidazole are five-membered, nitrogen-containing
heterocycles. Naphthalene, quinoline, indole, and many others are polycyclic aromatic compounds.

Aromatic compounds have the following characteristics:

· Aromatic compounds are cyclic, planar, and conjugated.
· Aromatic compounds are unusually stable. Benzene, for instance, has a heat of hydrogenation 150 kJ/mol

   less than we might expect for a cyclic triene.
· Aromatic compounds react with electrophiles to give substitution products, in which cyclic conjugation is

   retained, rather than addition products, in which conjugation is destroyed.
· Aromatic compounds have 4n + 2  electrons, which are delocalized over the ring.

compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of 4n + 2  electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of
the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.
The most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an
electrophile (E+) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is
characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound
to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.
522  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     Many different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To

     list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen (-Cl, -Br, -I), a nitro group (-NO2), a
     sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), an alkyl group (-R), or an acyl group (-COR). Starting from
     only a few simple materials, it's possible to prepare many thousands of substituted aromatic compounds.

     16.1 Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions: Bromination

     Before seeing how electrophilic aromatic substitutions occur, let's briefly recall what we said in the chapter on
     Alkenes: Structure and Reactivity about electrophilic alkene additions. When a reagent such as HCl adds to
     an alkene, the electrophilic hydrogen ion approaches the  electrons of the double bond and forms a bond to
     one carbon, leaving a positive charge at the other carbon. This carbocation intermediate then reacts with the
     nucleophilic Cl- ion to yield the addition product.

     An electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction begins in a similar way, but there are a number of differences.

     One difference is that aromatic rings are less reactive toward electrophiles than alkenes. For example, Br2 in

     CH2Cl2 solution reacts instantly with most alkenes but does not react with benzene at room temperature. For

     bromination of benzene to take place, a catalyst such as FeBr3 is needed. The catalyst makes the Br2 molecule
                                                                     species that reacts as if it were Br+. The polarized Br2
     more electrophilic by polarizing it to give a

     molecule then reacts with the nucleophilic benzene ring to yield a nonaromatic carbocation intermediate that

     is doubly allylic (Section 11.5) and has three resonance forms.

Although more stable than a typical alkyl carbocation because of resonance, the intermediate in electrophilic
aromatic substitution is nevertheless much less stable than the starting benzene ring itself, with its 150 kJ/mol
(36 kcal/mol) of aromatic stability. Thus, the reaction of an electrophile with a benzene ring is endergonic, has a
substantial activation energy, and is rather slow. FIGURE 16.2 shows an energy diagram comparing the reaction
of an electrophile with an alkene and with benzene. The benzene reaction is slower (higher G) because the
starting material is more stable.

FIGURE 16.2 A comparison of the reactions of an electrophile (E+) with an alkene and with benzene:  . The
benzene reaction is slower than the alkene reaction because of the stability of the aromatic ring.

Another difference between alkene addition and aromatic substitution occurs after the carbocation
intermediate has formed. Instead of adding Br- to give an addition product, the carbocation intermediate loses
H+ from the bromine-bearing carbon to give a substitution product. Note that this loss of H+ is similar to what

occurs in the second step of an E1 reaction (Section 11.10). The net effect of reaction of Br2 with benzene is the
substitution of H+ by Br+ by the overall mechanism shown in FIGURE 16.3.

     occurs in two steps and involves a resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate.

     Why does the reaction of Br2 with benzene take a different course than its reaction with an alkene? The answer
     is straightforward. If addition occurred, the 150 kJ/mol stabilization energy of the aromatic ring would be lost
     and the overall reaction would be endergonic. When substitution occurs, though, the stability of the aromatic
     ring is retained and the reaction is exergonic. An energy diagram for the overall process is shown in FIGURE
     16.4.

16.2 Other Aromatic Substitutions

There are many other kinds of electrophilic aromatic substitutions besides bromination, and all occur by the
same general mechanism. Let's look at some of these other reactions briefly.

Aromatic Halogenation

Chlorine and iodine can be introduced into aromatic rings by electrophilic substitution reactions just as
bromine can, but fluorine is too reactive and only poor yields of monofluoroaromatic products are obtained by
direct fluorination. Instead, other sources of "F+" are used, in which a fluorine atom is bonded to a positively
charged nitrogen. One of the most common such reagents goes by the acronym F-TEDA-BF4 in the presence of
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). (You don't need to know the full name of F-TEDA, which is sold under the
name Selectfluor.)

More than 20% of all pharmaceutical agents sold contain fluorine, including 30% of the top 100 drugs sold.
Sitagliptin (Januvia), used to treat type 2 diabetes, fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant, and atorvastatin
(Lipitor), a statin used to lower cholesterol, are examples.

Aromatic rings react with Cl2 in the presence of FeCl3 catalyst to yield chlorobenzenes, just as they react with
Br2 and FeBr3. This kind of reaction is used in the synthesis of numerous pharmaceutical agents, including the
antiallergy medication loratadine, marketed as Claritin.

Iodine itself is unreactive toward aromatic rings, so an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a copper
salt such as CuCl2 must be added to the reaction. These substances accelerate the iodination reaction by
oxidizing I2 to a more powerful electrophilic species that reacts as if it were I+. The aromatic ring then reacts
with I+ in the typical way, yielding a substitution product.
526  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     Electrophilic aromatic halogenations also occur in the biosynthesis of many naturally occurring molecules,
     particularly those produced by marine organisms. In humans, the best-known example occurs in the thyroid
     gland during the biosynthesis of thyroxine, a hormone involved in regulating growth and metabolism. The
     amino acid tyrosine is first iodinated by thyroid peroxidase, and two of the iodinated tyrosine molecules then
     couple. The electrophilic iodinating agent is an I+ species, perhaps hypoiodous acid (HIO), that is formed from
     iodide ion by oxidation with H2O2.

     Aromatic Nitration

     Aromatic rings are nitrated by reaction with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids. The electrophile
     is the nitronium ion, NO2+, which is formed from HNO3 by protonation and loss of water. The nitronium ion
     reacts with benzene to yield a carbocation intermediate, and loss of H+ from this intermediate gives the neutral
     substitution product, nitrobenzene (FIGURE 16.5).

FIGURE 16.5 The mechanism for electrophilic nitration of an aromatic ring. An electrostatic potential map of the reactive electrophile
         shows that the nitrogen atom is most positive.

Electrophilic nitration of an aromatic ring does not occur in nature but is particularly important in the
laboratory because the nitro-substituted product can be reduced by reagents such as iron, tin, or SnCl2 to yield
the corresponding arylamine, ArNH2. Attachment of an amino group (-NH2) to an aromatic ring by the two-step
nitration/reduction sequence is a key part of the industrial synthesis of many dyes and pharmaceutical agents.
We'll discuss this reduction and other reactions of aromatic nitrogen compounds in Chapter 24.

Aromatic Sulfonation

Aromatic rings can be sulfonated by reaction with so-called fuming sulfuric acid, a mixture of H2SO4 and SO3.

The reactive electrophile is either  or neutral SO3, depending on reaction conditions, and substitution

occurs by the same two-step mechanism seen previously for bromination and nitration (FIGURE 16.6). Note,

however, that the sulfonation reaction is readily reversible. It can occur either forward or backward, depending

on the reaction conditions. Sulfonation is favored in strong acid, but desulfonation is favored in hot, dilute

aqueous acid.
528  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     FIGURE 16.6 The mechanism for electrophilic sulfonation of an aromatic ring. An electrostatic potential map of the reactive electrophile
                   shows that sulfur and hydrogen are the most positive atoms.

     Aromatic sulfonation does not occur naturally but is widely used in the preparation of dyes and pharmaceutical
     agents. For example, the sulfa drugs, such as sulfanilamide, were among the first clinically useful antibiotics.
     Although largely replaced today by more effective agents, sulfa drugs are still used in the treatment of
     meningitis and urinary tract infections. These drugs are prepared commercially by a process that involves
     aromatic sulfonation as its key step.

     Aromatic Hydroxylation

     Direct hydroxylation of an aromatic ring to yield a hydroxybenzene (a phenol) is difficult and rarely done
     in the laboratory but occurs much more frequently in biological pathways. An example is the hydroxylation
     of p-hydroxyphenylacetate to give 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate. The reaction is catalyzed by
     p-hydroxyphenylacetate-3-hydroxylase and requires molecular oxygen plus the coenzyme reduced flavin
     adenine dinucleotide, abbreviated FADH2.

     By analogy with other electrophilic aromatic substitutions, you might expect that an electrophilic oxygen
     species acting as an "OH+ equivalent" is needed for the hydroxylation reaction. That is just what happens,
     with the electrophilic oxygen arising by protonation of FAD hydroperoxide, RO-OH (FIGURE 16.7); that is,

                                                  . The FAD hydroperoxide itself is formed by reaction of FADH2 with O2.

     16.3 Alkylation and Acylation of Aromatic Rings: The Friedel-Crafts Reaction

     Among the most useful electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions in the laboratory is alkylation--the
     introduction of an alkyl group onto the benzene ring. Called the Friedel-Crafts reaction after its founders in
     1877, Charles Friedel and James Crafts, the reaction is carried out by treating an aromatic compound with
     an alkyl chloride, RCl, in the presence of AlCl3 to generate a carbocation electrophile, R+. Aluminum chloride
     catalyzes the reaction by helping the alkyl halide to generate a carbocation in much the same way that FeBr3
     catalyzes aromatic brominations by polarizing Br2 (Section 16.1). Loss of H+ then completes the reaction
     (FIGURE 16.8).

                           FIGURE 16.8 MECHANISM

                           Mechanism for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction of benzene with
                           2-chloropropane to yield isopropylbenzene (cumene). The electrophile is a
                           carbocation, generated by AlCl3-assisted dissociation of an alkyl halide.

     Despite its utility, the Friedel-Crafts alkylation has several limitations. For one thing, only alkyl halides can be
     used. Aromatic (aryl) halides and vinylic halides don't react because aryl and vinylic carbocations are too high
     in energy to form under Friedel-Crafts conditions.

     Another limitation is that Friedel-Crafts reactions don't succeed on aromatic rings that are substituted either by
     a strongly electron-withdrawing group such as carbonyl (C=O) or by a basic amino group that can be protonated.
     We'll see in the next section that the presence of a substituent group already on a ring can have a dramatic effect
     on that ring's reactivity to further electrophilic substitution. Rings that contain any of the substituents listed in
     FIGURE 16.9 do not undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

FIGURE 16.9 Limitations on the aromatic substrate in Friedel-Crafts reactions. No reaction occurs if the substrate has either an electron-
withdrawing substituent or a basic amino group.

A third limitation to the Friedel-Crafts alkylation is that it's often difficult to stop the reaction after a single
substitution. Once the first alkyl group is on the ring, a second substitution reaction is facilitated for reasons
we'll discuss in the next section. Thus, we often observe polyalkylation. Reaction of benzene with 1 mol
equivalent of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, yields p-di-tert-butylbenzene as the major product,
along with small amounts of tert-butylbenzene and unreacted benzene. A high yield of mono-alkylation product
is obtained only when a large excess of benzene is used.

A final limitation to the Friedel-Crafts reaction is that a skeletal rearrangement of the alkyl carbocation
electrophile sometimes occurs during reaction, particularly when a primary alkyl halide is used. Treatment of
benzene with 1-chlorobutane at 0 °C, for instance, gives an approximately 2 : 1 ratio of rearranged (sec-butyl) to
unrearranged (butyl) products.
The carbocation rearrangements that accompany Friedel-Crafts reactions are like those that accompany
electrophilic additions to alkenes (Section 7.11) and occur either by hydride shift or alkyl shift. For example,
the relatively unstable primary butyl carbocation produced by reaction of 1-chlorobutane with AlCl3 rearranges
to the more stable secondary butyl carbocation by the shift of a hydrogen atom and its electron pair (a hydride
ion, H:-) from C2 to C1. Similarly, alkylation of benzene with 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylpropane yields
(1,1-dimethylpropyl)benzene. The initially formed primary carbocation rearranges to a tertiary carbocation by
shift of a methyl group and its electron pair from C2 to C1.
532  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     Just as an aromatic ring is alkylated by reaction with an alkyl chloride, it is acylated by reaction with a
     carboxylic acid chloride, RCOCl, in the presence of AlCl3. That is, an acyl group (-COR; pronounced a-sil) is
     substituted onto the aromatic ring. For example, reaction of benzene with acetyl chloride yields the ketone
     acetophenone.

     The mechanism of Friedel-Crafts acylation is similar to that of Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and the same
     limitations on the aromatic substrate noted previously in FIGURE 16.9 for alkylation also apply to acylation.
     The reactive electrophile is a resonance-stabilized acyl cation, generated by reaction between the acyl chloride
     and AlCl3 (FIGURE 16.10). As the resonance structures in the figure indicate, an acyl cation is stabilized by
     interaction of the vacant orbital on carbon with lone-pair electrons on the neighboring oxygen. Because of this
     stabilization, no carbocation rearrangement occurs during acylation.

     FIGURE 16.10 Mechanism of the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The electrophile is a resonance-stabilized acyl cation, whose
     electrostatic potential map indicates that carbon is the most positive atom.

Unlike the multiple substitutions that often occur in Friedel-Crafts alkylations, acylations never occur more
than once on a ring because the product acylbenzene is less reactive than the nonacylated starting material.
We'll account for this reactivity difference in the next section.

Aromatic alkylations occur in numerous biological pathways, although there is of course no AlCl3 present in
living systems to catalyze the reaction. Instead, the carbocation electrophile is typically formed by dissociation
of an organodiphosphate, as we saw in Section 11.6. The dissociation is usually assisted by complexation to a
divalent metal cation such as Mg2+, just as dissociation of an alkyl chloride is assisted by AlCl3.

An example of a biological Friedel-Crafts reaction occurs during the biosynthesis of phylloquinone, or vitamin
K1, the human blood-clotting factor. Phylloquinone is formed by reaction of 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoic acid with
phytyl diphosphate. Phytyl diphosphate first dissociates to a resonance-stabilized allylic carbocation, which
then substitutes onto the aromatic ring in the typical way. Several further transformations lead to phylloquinone
(FIGURE 16.11).

FIGURE 16.11 Biosynthesis of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) from 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoic acid. The key step that joins the 20-carbon
phytyl side chain to the aromatic ring is a Friedel-Crafts-like electrophilic substitution reaction with a diphosphate ion as the leaving group.

     16.4 Substituent Effects in Electrophilic Substitutions

     Only one product can form when an electrophilic substitution occurs on benzene, but what would happen if
     we were to carry out a reaction on an aromatic ring that already has a substituent? The initial presence of a
     substituent on the ring has two effects.

       · Substituents affect the reactivity of the aromatic ring. Some substituents activate the ring, making
           it more reactive than benzene, and some deactivate the ring, making it less reactive than benzene. In
           aromatic nitration, for instance, an -OH substituent makes the ring 1000 times more reactive than
           benzene, while an -NO2 substituent makes the ring more than 10 million times less reactive.

· Substituents affect the orientation of the reaction. The three possible disubstituted products--ortho,
   meta, and para--are usually not formed in equal amounts. Instead, the nature of the substituent initially
   present on the benzene ring determines the position of the second substitution. An -OH group directs
   substitution toward the ortho and para positions, for instance, while a carbonyl group such as -CHO directs
   substitution primarily toward the meta position. TABLE 16.1 lists experimental results for the nitration of
   some substituted benzenes.

Activating and Deactivating Effects

What makes a group either activating or deactivating? The common characteristic of all activating groups is
that they donate electrons to the ring, thereby making the ring more electron-rich, stabilizing the carbocation
intermediate, and lowering the activation energy for its formation. Conversely, the common characteristic of all
deactivating groups is that they withdraw electrons from the ring, thereby making the ring more electron-poor,
destabilizing the carbocation intermediate, and raising the activation energy for its formation.

Compare the electrostatic potential maps of benzaldehyde (deactivated), chlorobenzene (weakly deactivated),
and phenol (activated) with that of benzene. As shown in FIGURE 16.13, the ring is more positive (yellow-green)
when an electron-withdrawing group such as -CHO or -Cl is present and more negative (red) when an electron-
donating group such as -OH is present.
538  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     FIGURE 16.13 Electrostatic potential maps of benzene and several substituted benzenes show that an electron-withdrawing group
     (-CHO or -Cl) makes the ring more electron-poor, while an electron-donating group (-OH) makes the ring more electron-rich.

     The withdrawal or donation of electrons by a substituent group is controlled by an interplay of inductive effects
     and resonance effects. As we saw in Section 2.1, an inductive effect is the withdrawal or donation of electrons
     through a  bond due to electronegativity. Halogens, hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, cyano groups, and
     nitro groups inductively withdraw electrons through the  bond linking the substituent to a benzene ring.
     This effect is most pronounced in halobenzenes and phenols, in which the electronegative atom is directly
     attached to the ring, but is also significant in carbonyl compounds, nitriles, and nitro compounds, in which the
     electronegative atom is farther removed. Alkyl groups, on the other hand, inductively donate electrons. This is
     the same hyperconjugative donating effect that causes alkyl substituents to stabilize alkenes (Section 7.6) and
     carbocations (Section 7.9).

     A resonance effect is the withdrawal or donation of electrons through a  bond due to the overlap of a p orbital
     on the substituent with a p orbital on the aromatic ring. Carbonyl, cyano, and nitro substituents, for example,
     withdraw electrons from the aromatic ring by resonance. The  electrons flow from the ring to the substituent,
     leaving a positive charge in the ring. Note that substituents with an electron-withdrawing resonance effect have
     the general structure -Y=Z, where the Z atom is more electronegative than Y.
     Conversely, halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxyl (-OR), and amino substituents donate electrons to the aromatic ring by
     resonance. Lone-pair electrons flow from the substituents to the ring, placing a negative charge on the ring.
     Substituents with an electron-donating resonance effect have the general structure , where the Y atom has a
     lone pair of electrons available for donation to the ring.

One further point: inductive effects and resonance effects don't necessarily act in the same direction. Halogen,
hydroxyl, alkoxyl, and amino substituents, for instance, have electron-withdrawing inductive effects because
of the electronegativity of the -X, -O, or -N atom bonded to the aromatic ring but have electron-donating
resonance effects because of the lone-pair electrons on those -X, -O, or -N atoms. When the two effects
act in opposite directions, the stronger effect dominates. Thus, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, and amino substituents
are activators because their stronger electron-donating resonance effect outweighs their weaker electron-
withdrawing inductive effect. Halogens, however, are deactivators because their stronger electron-withdrawing
inductive effect outweighs their weaker electron-donating resonance effect.

     Ortho- and Para-Directing Activators: Alkyl Groups

     Inductive and resonance effects account not only for reactivity but also for the orientation of electrophilic
     aromatic substitutions. Take alkyl groups, for instance, which have an electron-donating inductive effect and
     are ortho and para directors. The results of toluene nitration are shown in FIGURE 16.14.

     FIGURE 16.14 Carbocation intermediates in the nitration of toluene. Ortho and para intermediates are more stable than the meta
     intermediate because the positive charge is on a tertiary carbon rather than a secondary carbon.

     Nitration of toluene might occur either ortho, meta, or para to the methyl group, giving the three carbocation
     intermediates shown in in FIGURE 16.14. Although all three intermediates are resonance-stabilized, the ortho
     and para intermediates are more stabilized than the meta intermediate. For both the ortho and para reactions,
     but not for the meta reaction, a resonance form places the positive charge directly on the methyl-substituted
     carbon, where it is in a tertiary position and can be stabilized by the electron-donating inductive effect of the
     methyl group. The ortho and para intermediates are thus lower in energy than the meta intermediate and form
     faster.

     Ortho- and Para-Directing Activators: OH and NH2

     Hydroxyl, alkoxyl, and amino groups are also ortho-para activators, but for a different reason than for alkyl
     groups. As described earlier in this section, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, and amino groups have a strong, electron-
     donating resonance effect that outweighs a weaker electron-withdrawing inductive effect. When phenol is
     nitrated, for instance, reaction can occur either ortho, meta, or para to the -OH group, giving the carbocation
     intermediates shown in FIGURE 16.15. The ortho and para intermediates are more stable than the meta
     intermediate because they have more resonance forms, including one particularly favorable form that allows
     the positive charge to be stabilized by electron donation from the substituent oxygen atom. The intermediate

Ortho- and Para-Directing Deactivators: Halogens

Halogens are deactivating because their stronger electron-withdrawing inductive effect outweighs their weaker
electron-donating resonance effect. Although weak, that electron-donating resonance effect is nevertheless felt
only at the ortho and para positions and not at the meta position (FIGURE 16.16). Thus, a halogen substituent
can stabilize the positive charge of the carbocation intermediates from ortho and para reaction in the same way
that hydroxyl and amino substituents can. The meta intermediate, however, has no such stabilization and is
therefore formed more slowly.

     Note again that halogens, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, and amino groups all withdraw electrons inductively but donate
     electrons by resonance. Halogens have a stronger electron-withdrawing inductive effect but a weaker electron-
     donating resonance effect and are thus deactivators. Hydroxyl, alkoxyl, and amino groups have a weaker
     electron-withdrawing inductive effect but a stronger electron-donating resonance effect and are thus activators.
     All are ortho and para directors, however, because of the lone pair of electrons on the atom bonded to the
     aromatic ring.

     Meta-Directing Deactivators

     The influence of meta-directing substituents can be explained using the same kinds of arguments used for
     ortho and para directors. Look at the nitration of benzaldehyde, for instance (FIGURE 16.17). Of the three
     possible carbocation intermediates, the meta intermediate has three favorable resonance forms, whereas the
     ortho and para intermediates have only two. In both ortho and para intermediates, the third resonance form is
     unfavorable because it places the positive charge directly on the carbon that bears the aldehyde group, where it
     is disfavored by a repulsive interaction with the positively polarized carbon atom of the C=O group. Hence, the
     meta intermediate is more favored and is formed faster than the ortho and para intermediates.

     16.5 Trisubstituted Benzenes: Additivity of Effects

     Electrophilic substitution of a disubstituted benzene ring is governed by the same resonance and inductive
     effects that influence monosubstituted rings. The only difference is that it's necessary to consider the additive
     effects of two different groups. In practice, this isn't as difficult as it sounds; three rules are usually sufficient.

     RULE 1
     If the directing effects of the two groups reinforce each other, the situation is straightforward. In p-nitrotoluene,
     for example, both the methyl and the nitro group direct further substitution to the same position (ortho to the
     methyl = meta to the nitro). A single product is thus formed on electrophilic substitution.

     RULE 2
     If the directing effects of the two groups oppose each other, the more powerful activating group has the
     dominant influence, but mixtures of products are often formed. For example, bromination of p-methylphenol
     yields primarily 2-bromo-4-methylphenol because -OH is a more powerful activator than -CH3.

     RULE 3
     Further substitution rarely occurs between the two groups in a meta-disubstituted compound because this site
     is too hindered. Aromatic rings with three adjacent substituents must therefore be prepared by some other
     route, such as by substitution of an ortho-disubstituted compound.

Strategy

which substituent is the stronger activator. In the present case, the carboxyl group (-CO2H) is a meta director

16.6 Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution

Although aromatic substitution reactions usually occur by an electrophilic mechanism, aryl halides that have
electron-withdrawing substituents can also undergo a nucleophilic substitution reaction. For example,
2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene reacts with aqueous NaOH at room temperature to give 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Here,
the nucleophile OH- substitutes for Cl-.

Nucleophilic aromatic substitution is much less common than electrophilic substitution but nevertheless
does have certain uses. One such use is the reaction of proteins with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, known as
Sanger's reagent, to attach a "label" to the terminal NH2 group of the amino acid at one end of the protein chain.
546  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     Although the reaction appears superficially similar to the SN1 and SN2 nucleophilic substitutions of alkyl
     halides discussed in the chapter on Reactions of Alkyl Halides: Nucleophilic Substitutions and Eliminations,
     it must be different because aryl halides are inert to both SN1 and SN2 conditions. SN1 reactions don't occur
     with aryl halides because dissociation of the halide is energetically unfavorable, due to the instability of the
     potential aryl cation product. SN2 reactions don't occur with aryl halides because the halo-substituted carbon of
     the aromatic ring is sterically shielded from a backside approach. For a nucleophile to react with an aryl halide,
     it would have to approach directly through the aromatic ring and invert the stereochemistry of the aromatic ring
     carbon--a geometric impossibility.

     Instead, nucleophilic substitutions on an aromatic ring proceed by the mechanism shown in FIGURE 16.18. The
     nucleophile first adds to the electron-deficient aryl halide, forming a resonance-stabilized, negatively charged
     intermediate called a Meisenheimer complex after its discoverer. Halide ion is then eliminated.

FIGURE 16.18 MECHANISM

Mechanism of nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction occurs in two
steps and involves a resonance-stabilized carbanion intermediate.

Nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs only if the aromatic ring has an electron-withdrawing substituent in
a position ortho or para to the leaving group to stabilize the anion intermediate through resonance (FIGURE
16.19). A meta substituent offers no such resonance stabilization. Thus, p-chloronitrobenzene and
o-chloronitrobenzene react with hydroxide ion at 130 °C to yield substitution products, but
m-chloronitrobenzene is inert to OH-.

     FIGURE 16.19 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution on nitrochlorobenzenes. Only in the ortho and para intermediates is the negative charge
     stabilized by a resonance interaction with the nitro group, so only the ortho and para isomers undergo reaction.

     Note the differences between electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions. Electrophilic substitutions
     are favored by electron-donating substituents, which stabilize a carbocation intermediate, while nucleophilic
     substitutions are favored by electron-withdrawing substituents, which stabilize a carbanion intermediate. Thus,
     the electron-withdrawing groups that deactivate rings for electrophilic substitution (nitro, carbonyl, cyano, and
     so forth) activate them for nucleophilic substitution. What's more, these functional groups are meta directors
     in electrophilic substitution but are ortho-para directors in nucleophilic substitution. And finally, electrophilic
     substitutions replace hydrogen on the ring, while nucleophilic substitutions replace a leaving group, usually
     halide ion.

     At high temperature and pressure, however, even chlorobenzene can be forced to react. Chemists at the Dow
     Chemical Company discovered in 1928 that phenol could be prepared on an industrial scale by treatment of
     chlorobenzene with dilute aqueous NaOH at 340 °C under 170 atm pressure.

A similar substitution reaction occurs with other strong bases. Treatment of bromobenzene with potassium
amide (KNH2) in liquid NH3 solvent, for instance, gives aniline. Curiously, though, when using bromobenzene
labeled with radioactive 14C at the C1 position, the substitution product has equal amounts of the label at both
C1 and C2, implying the presence of a symmetrical reaction intermediate in which C1 and C2 are equivalent.

Further mechanistic evidence comes from trapping experiments. When bromobenzene is treated with KNH2 in
the presence of a conjugated diene, such as furan, a Diels-Alder reaction (Section 14.4) occurs, implying that
the symmetrical intermediate is a benzyne, formed by elimination of HBr from bromobenzene. Benzyne is too
reactive to be isolated as a pure compound but, in the presence of water, addition occurs to give phenol. In the
presence of a diene, Diels-Alder cycloaddition takes place.

The electronic structure of benzyne, shown in FIGURE 16.20, is that of a highly distorted alkyne. Although
a typical alkyne triple bond uses sp-hybridized carbon atoms, the benzyne triple bond uses sp2-hybridized
carbons. Furthermore, a typical alkyne triple bond has two mutually perpendicular  bonds formed by p-p
overlap, but the benzyne triple bond has one  bond formed by p-p overlap and one  bond formed by sp2-sp2
overlap. The latter  bond is in the plane of the ring and is very weak.

     16.8 Oxidation of Aromatic Compounds

     Oxidation of Alkyl Side Chains

     Despite its unsaturation, the benzene ring is inert to strong oxidizing agents such as KMnO4, which will cleave
     alkene carbon-carbon bonds (Section 8.8). It turns out, however, that the presence of the aromatic ring has a
     dramatic effect on the reactivity of alkyl side chains. These side chains react rapidly with oxidizing agents and
     are converted into carboxyl groups, -CO2H.The net effect is conversion of an alkylbenzene into a benzoic acid,

                                 . Butylbenzene is oxidized by aqueous KMnO4 to give benzoic acid, for instance.

     A similar oxidation is employed industrially for the preparation of the terephthalic acid used in the production
     of polyester fibers. Worldwide, approximately 118 million tons per year of terephthalic acid is produced by
     oxidation of p-xylene, using air as the oxidant and Co(III) salts as catalyst.

     The mechanism of side-chain oxidation is complex and involves reaction of C-H bonds at the position next
     to the aromatic ring to form intermediate benzylic radicals. tert-Butylbenzene has no benzylic hydrogens,
     however, and is therefore inert.

     Analogous side-chain oxidations occur in various biosynthetic pathways. The neurotransmitter
     norepinephrine, for instance, is biosynthesized from dopamine by a benzylic hydroxylation reaction. The
     process is catalyzed by the copper-containing enzyme dopamine -monooxygenase and occurs by a radical
     mechanism. A copper-oxygen species in the enzyme first abstracts the pro-R benzylic hydrogen to give a
     radical, and a hydroxyl is then transferred from copper to carbon.

(a)  (b)

Bromination of Alkylbenzene Side Chains

Side-chain bromination at the benzylic position occurs when an alkylbenzene is treated with
N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). For example, propylbenzene gives (1-bromopropyl)benzene in 97% yield on
reaction with NBS in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO2)2, as a radical initiator. Bromination occurs
exclusively in the benzylic position next to the aromatic ring and does not give a mixture of products.

The mechanism of benzylic bromination is similar to that discussed in Section 10.3 for allylic bromination of
alkenes. Abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen atom first generates an intermediate benzylic radical, which then
reacts with Br2 in step 2 to yield product and a radical, which cycles back into the reaction to carry on the
chain shown below as a summary. The Br2 needed for reaction with the benzylic radical is produced in step 3
by a concurrent reaction of HBr with NBS.

Reaction occurs exclusively at the benzylic position because the benzylic radical intermediate is stabilized by
resonance. FIGURE 16.21 shows how the benzyl radical is stabilized by overlap of its p orbital with the ringed 
electron system.

FIGURE 16.21 A resonance-stabilized benzylic radical. The spin-density surface shows that the unpaired electron is shared by the ortho

     16.9 Reduction of Aromatic Compounds

     Catalytic Hydrogenation of Aromatic Rings

     Just as aromatic rings are generally inert to oxidation, they're also inert to catalytic hydrogenation under
     conditions that reduce typical alkene double bonds. As a result, it's possible to reduce an alkene double bond
     selectively in the presence of an aromatic ring. For example, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one is reduced to
     4-phenyl-2-butanone using a palladium catalyst at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Neither the
     benzene ring nor the ketone carbonyl group is affected.

     To hydrogenate an aromatic ring, it's necessary either to use a platinum catalyst with hydrogen gas at a
     pressure of several hundred atmospheres or to use a more effective catalyst such as rhodium on carbon.
     Under these conditions, aromatic rings are converted into cyclohexanes. For example, o-xylene yields
     1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, and 4-tert-butylphenol gives 4-tert-butylcyclohexanol.

     Reduction of Aryl Alkyl Ketones

     In the same way that an aromatic ring activates a neighboring (benzylic) C-H toward oxidation, it also activates
     a benzylic carbonyl group toward reduction. Thus, an aryl alkyl ketone prepared by Friedel-Crafts acylation of
     an aromatic ring can be converted into an alkylbenzene by catalytic hydrogenation over a palladium catalyst.

Propiophenone, for instance, is reduced to propylbenzene by catalytic hydrogenation. Because the net effect
of Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction is the preparation of a primary alkylbenzene, this two-step
sequence of reactions makes it possible to circumvent the carbocation rearrangement problems associated
with direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation using a primary alkyl halide (Section 16.3).

The conversion of a carbonyl group into a methylene group (            ) by catalytic hydrogenation is limited

to aryl alkyl ketones; dialkyl ketones are not reduced under these conditions. Furthermore, the catalytic

reduction of aryl alkyl ketones is not compatible with the presence of a nitro substituent on the aromatic ring

because a nitro group is reduced to an amino group under reaction conditions. We'll see a more general method

for reducing ketone carbonyl groups to yield alkanes in Section 19.9.

16.10 Synthesis of Polysubstituted Benzenes

As discussed in the Introduction to Organic Synthesis in Section 9.9, one of the surest ways to learn organic
chemistry is to work synthesis problems. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthesis of a complex
molecule requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of a great many organic reactions. Not only
must you know which reactions to use, you must also know when to use them because the order in which
reactions are carried out is often critical to the success of the overall scheme.

The ability to plan a sequence of reactions in the right order is particularly important in the synthesis of
substituted aromatic rings, where the introduction of a new substituent is strongly affected by the directing
effects of other substituents. Planning syntheses of substituted aromatic compounds is therefore a good way to
gain confidence in using the many reactions discussed in the past few chapters.

As we said in Section 9.9, it's usually best to work a synthesis problem backward, or retrosynthetically. Look
at the target molecule and ask yourself, "What is an immediate precursor of this compound?" Choose a likely
answer and continue working backward, one step at a time, until you arrive at a simple starting material. Let's
try some examples.

     Synthesizing a Polysubstituted Benzene

     How would you synthesize 4-bromo-2-nitrotoluene from benzene?

     Strategy
     Draw the target molecule, identify the substituents, and recall how each group can be introduced separately.
     Then plan retrosynthetically.

     The three substituents on the ring are a bromine, a methyl group, and a nitro group. A bromine can be
     introduced by bromination with Br2/FeBr3, a methyl group can be introduced by Friedel-Crafts alkylation with
     CH3Cl/AlCl3, and a nitro group can be introduced by nitration with HNO3/H2SO4.

     Solution

     Ask yourself, "What is an immediate precursor of the target?" The final step will involve introduction of one
     of three groups--bromine, methyl, or nitro--so we have to consider three possibilities. Of the three, the
     bromination of o-nitrotoluene could be used because the activating methyl group would dominate the
     deactivating nitro group and direct bromination to the correct position. Unfortunately, a mixture of product
     isomers would be formed. A Friedel-Crafts reaction can't be used as the final step because this reaction
     doesn't work on a nitro-substituted (strongly deactivated) benzene. The best precursor of the desired product is
     probably p-bromotoluene, which can be nitrated ortho to the activating methyl group to give a single product.

     Next ask, "What is an immediate precursor of p-bromotoluene?" Perhaps toluene is an immediate precursor
     because the methyl group would direct bromination to the ortho and para positions. Alternatively,
     bromobenzene might be an immediate precursor because we could carry out a Friedel-Crafts methylation and
     obtain a mixture of ortho and para products. Both answers are satisfactory, although both would also lead
     unavoidably to a mixture of products that would have to be separated.

     "What is an immediate precursor of toluene?" Benzene, which could be methylated in a Friedel-Crafts reaction.
     Alternatively, "What is an immediate precursor of bromobenzene?" Benzene, which could be brominated.

The retrosynthetic analysis has provided two valid routes from benzene to 4-bromo-2-nitrotoluene.

        WORKED EXAMPLE 16.5

Synthesizing a Polysubstituted Benzene

Synthesize 4-chloro-2-propylbenzenesulfonic acid from benzene.

Strategy
Draw the target molecule, identify its substituents, and recall how each of the three can be introduced. Then
plan retrosynthetically.

The three substituents on the ring are a chlorine, a propyl group, and a sulfonic acid group. A chlorine can
be introduced by chlorination with Cl2/FeCl3, a propyl group can be introduced by Friedel-Crafts acylation
with CH3CH2COCl/AlCl3 followed by reduction with H2/Pd, and a sulfonic acid group can be introduced by
sulfonation with SO3/H2SO4.
Solution
"What is an immediate precursor of the target?" The final step will involve introduction of one of three
groups--chlorine, propyl, or sulfonic acid--so we have to consider three possibilities. Of the three, the
chlorination of o-propylbenzenesulfonic acid can't be used because the reaction would occur at the wrong
position. Similarly, a Friedel-Crafts reaction can't be used as the final step because this reaction doesn't work
on sulfonic-acid-substituted (strongly deactivated) benzenes. Thus, the immediate precursor of the desired
product is probably m-chloropropylbenzene, which can be sulfonated to give a mixture of product isomers that
must then be separated.
556  16 · Chemistry of Benzene: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

     "What is an immediate precursor of m-chloropropylbenzene?" Because the two substituents have a meta
     relationship, the first substituent placed on the ring must be a meta director so that the second substitution
     will take place at the proper position. Furthermore, because primary alkyl groups such as propyl can't be
     introduced directly by Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the precursor of m-chloropropylbenzene is probably
     m-chloropropiophenone, which could be catalytically reduced.

     "What is an immediate precursor of m-chloropropiophenone?" Propiophenone, which could be chlorinated in
     the meta position.

     "What is an immediate precursor of propiophenone?" Benzene, which could undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation
     with propanoyl chloride and AlCl3.

     CHEMISTRY MATTERS

Combinatorial Chemistry

Traditionally, organic compounds have been synthesized one at a time. This works well for preparing large
amounts of a few substances, but it doesn't work so well for preparing small amounts of a great many
substances. This latter goal is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, where vast numbers of
structurally similar compounds must be synthesized and screened to find an optimum drug candidate.
To speed the process of drug discovery, combinatorial chemistry has been developed to prepare what are
called combinatorial libraries, in which anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred thousand substances
are prepared simultaneously. Among the early successes of combinatorial chemistry is the development of a
benzodiazepine library, a class of aromatic compounds commonly used as antianxiety agents.

Two main approaches to combinatorial chemistry are used--parallel synthesis and split synthesis. In parallel
synthesis, each compound is prepared independently. Typically, a reactant is first linked to the surface of
polymer beads, which are then placed into small wells on a 96-well glass plate. Programmable robotic
instruments add different sequences of building blocks to the different wells, thereby making 96 different
products. When the reaction sequences are complete, the polymer beads are washed and their products are
released.
In split synthesis, the initial reactant is again linked to the surface of polymer beads, which are then divided into
several groups. A different building block is added to each group of beads, the different groups are combined,
and the reassembled mix is again split to form new groups. Another building block is added to each group, the
groups are again combined and redivided, and the process continues. If, for example, the beads are divided into
four groups at each step, the number of compounds increases in the progression 4  16  64  256. After 10
steps, more than 1 million compounds have been prepared (FIGURE 16.23).
Of course, with so many different final products mixed together, the problem is to identify them. What structure
is linked to what bead? Several approaches to this problem have been developed, all of which involve the
attachment of encoding labels to each polymer bead to keep track of the chemistry each has undergone.
Encoding labels used thus far have included proteins, nucleic acids, halogenated aromatic compounds, and
even computer chips.

Summary

We've continued the coverage of aromatic molecules in this chapter, shifting focus to concentrate on reactions.
In particular, we've looked at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity, a relationship critical
to understanding how numerous biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they
behave as they do.

An electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction takes place in two steps--initial reaction of an electrophile,
E+, with the aromatic ring, followed by loss of H+ from the resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate to

regenerate the aromatic ring.

Many variations of the reaction can be carried out, including halogenation, nitration, and sulfonation.
Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation reactions, which involve reaction of an aromatic ring with carbocation
electrophiles, are particularly useful. They are limited, however, by the fact that the aromatic ring must be at
least as reactive as a halobenzene. In addition, polyalkylation and carbocation rearrangements often occur in
Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

Substituents on the benzene ring affect both the reactivity of the ring toward further substitution and the
orientation of that substitution. Groups can be classified as ortho- and para-directing activators, ortho- and
para-directing deactivators, or meta-directing deactivators. Substituents influence aromatic rings by a
combination of resonance and inductive effects. Resonance effects are transmitted through  bonds; inductive
effects are transmitted through  bonds.
560 16 · Summary of Reactions

Halobenzenes undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution through either of two mechanisms. If the
halobenzene has a strongly electron-withdrawing substituent in the ortho or para position, substitution occurs
by addition of a nucleophile to the ring, followed by elimination of halide from the intermediate anion. If the
halobenzene is not activated by an electron-withdrawing substituent, substitution can occur by elimination of
HX to give a benzyne, followed by addition of a nucleophile.
The benzylic position of an alkylbenzene can be brominated by reaction with N-bromosuccinimide, and the
entire side chain can be degraded to a carboxyl group by oxidation with aqueous KMnO4. Aromatic rings can
also be reduced to cyclohexanes by hydrogenation over a platinum or rhodium catalyst, and aryl alkyl ketones
are reduced to alkylbenzenes by hydrogenation over a platinum catalyst.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Up to this point, we've focused on developing some general ideas of organic reactivity,
looking at the chemistry of hydrocarbons and alkyl halides, and examining some of the tools used in structural
studies. With that background, it's now time to begin a study of the oxygen-containing functional groups that lie
at the heart of organic and biological chemistry. We'll look at alcohols in this chapter and move on to carbonyl
compounds in Chapters 19 through 23.
Alcohols and phenols can be thought of as organic derivatives of water in which one of water's hydrogens is
replaced by an organic group: H-O-H versus R-O-H and Ar-O-H. In practice, the name alcohol is restricted to
572  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     compounds that have their -OH group bonded to a saturated, sp3-hybridized carbon atom, while compounds
     with their -OH group bonded to a vinylic, sp2-hybridized carbon are called enols. We'll look at enols in Chapter

     22.

     Alcohols occur widely in nature and have many industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Methanol, for
     instance, is one of the most important of all industrial chemicals. Historically, methanol was prepared by
     heating wood in the absence of air and thus came to be called wood alcohol. Today, approximately 173 million
     tons (50 billion gallons) of methanol is manufactured worldwide each year, most of it by catalytic reduction of
     carbon monoxide with hydrogen gas. Methanol is toxic to humans, causing blindness in small doses (15 mL)
     and death in larger amounts (100-250 mL). Industrially, it is used both as a solvent and as a starting material
     for production of formaldehyde (CH2O) and acetic acid (CH3CO2H).

     Ethanol was one of the first organic chemicals to be prepared and purified. Its production by fermentation of
     grains and sugars has been carried out for perhaps 9000 years, and its purification by distillation goes back at
     least as far as the 12th century. Today, approximately 88 million tons (26 billion gallons) of ethanol are produced
     worldwide each year, most of it by fermentation of corn, barley, sorghum, and other plant sources. Almost all of
     this ethanol is used for bus and automobile fuel.

     Ethanol for industrial use as a solvent or chemical intermediate is largely obtained by acid-catalyzed hydration
     of ethylene at high temperature.

     Phenols occur widely throughout nature and also serve as intermediates in the industrial synthesis of products
     as diverse as adhesives and antiseptics. Phenol itself is a general disinfectant found in coal tar; methyl salicylate
     is a flavoring agent found in oil of wintergreen; and urushiols are the allergenic constituents of poison oak and
     poison ivy. Note that the word phenol is the name both of the specific compound (hydroxybenzene) and of the
     class of compounds.

     17.1 Naming Alcohols and Phenols

     Alcohols are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°), depending on the number of organic
     groups bonded to the hydroxyl-bearing carbon.

Simple alcohols are named in the IUPAC system as derivatives of the parent alkane, using the suffix -ol.

RULE 1
Select the longest carbon chain containing the hydroxyl group, and derive the parent name by replacing the -e
ending of the corresponding alkane with -ol. The -e is deleted to prevent the occurrence of two adjacent vowels:
propanol rather than propaneol, for example.

RULE 2
Number the alkane chain beginning at the end nearer the hydroxyl group.

RULE 3
Number the substituents according to their position on the chain, and write the name, listing the substituents
in alphabetical order and identifying the position to which the -OH is bonded. Note that in naming
cis-1,4-cyclohexanediol, the final -e of cyclohexane is not deleted because the next letter, d, is not a vowel;
that is, cyclohexanediol rather than cyclohexandiol. Also, as with alkenes (Section 7.3), newer IUPAC naming
recommendations place the locant immediately before the suffix rather than before the parent.

Some simple and widely occurring alcohols have common names that are accepted by IUPAC. For example:

Phenols are named as described previously for aromatic compounds according to the rules discussed in Section
15.1, with -phenol used as the parent name rather than -benzene.

     17.2 Properties of Alcohols and Phenols

     Alcohols and phenols have nearly the same geometry around the oxygen atom as water. The R-O-H bond
     angle has an approximately tetrahedral value (108.5° in methanol, for instance), and the oxygen atom is
     sp3-hybridized.

     Also like water, alcohols and phenols have higher boiling points than might be expected, because of hydrogen-
     bonding (Section 2.12). A positively polarized -OH hydrogen atom from one molecule is attracted to a lone pair
     of electrons on the electronegative oxygen atom of another molecule, resulting in a weak force that holds the
     molecules together (FIGURE 17.2). These intermolecular attractions must be overcome for a molecule to break
     free from the liquid and enter the vapor state, so the boiling temperature is raised. For example, 1-propanol
     (MW = 60), butane (MW = 58), and chloroethane (MW = 65) have similar molecular weights, yet 1-propanol boils
     at 97 °C, compared with -0.5 °C for the alkane and 12.5 °C for the chloroalkane.

     FIGURE 17.2 Hydrogen-bonding in alcohols and phenols. Attraction between a positively polarized -OH hydrogen and a negatively
     polarized oxygen holds molecules together. The electrostatic potential map of methanol shows the positively polarized -OH hydrogen and
     the negatively polarized oxygen.

     Another similarity with water is that alcohols and phenols are both weakly basic and weakly acidic. As weak
     bases, they are reversibly protonated by strong acids to yield oxonium ions, ROH2+.

     As weak acids, they dissociate slightly in dilute aqueous solution by donating a proton to water, generating H3O+
     and an alkoxide ion, RO-, or a phenoxide ion, ArO-.

Recall from the earlier discussion of acidity in Section 2.7 to Section 2.11 that the strength of any acid HA in
water can be expressed by an acidity constant, Ka.

Compounds with a smaller Ka and larger pKa are less acidic, whereas compounds with a larger Ka and smaller
pKa are more acidic. As shown in TABLE 17.1, simple alcohols like methanol and ethanol are about as acidic
as water, but the more highly substituted tert-butyl alcohol is somewhat weaker. Substituent groups also have

a significant effect: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is approximately 3700 times stronger than ethanol, for instance.
Phenols and thiols, the sulfur analogs of alcohols, are substantially more acidic than water.

The effect of alkyl substitution on alcohol acidity is due primarily to solvation of the alkoxide ion formed on acid
dissociation. The more readily the alkoxide ion is solvated by water, the more stable it is, the more its formation
is energetically favored, and the greater the acidity of the parent alcohol. For example, the oxygen atom of an
unhindered alkoxide ion, such as that from methanol, is sterically accessible and is easily solvated by water. The
oxygen atom of a hindered alkoxide ion, however, such as that from tert-butyl alcohol, is less easily solvated and
is therefore less stable.
576  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     Inductive effects (Section 16.4) are also important in determining alcohol acidities. Electron-withdrawing
     halogen substituents, for instance, stabilize an alkoxide ion by spreading the charge over a larger volume,
     thus making the alcohol more acidic. Compare, for instance, the acidities of ethanol (pKa = 16) and
     2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (pKa = 12.43), or of tert-butyl alcohol (pKa = 18) and nonafluoro-tert-butyl alcohol (pKa =
     5.4).

     Because alcohols are weak acids, they don't react with weak bases, such as amines or bicarbonate ion, and they
     only react to a limited extent with metal hydroxides such as NaOH. Alcohols do, however, react with alkali metals
     and with strong bases such as sodium hydride (NaH), sodium amide (NaNH2), and Grignard reagents (RMgX).
     Alkoxides are themselves bases that are frequently used as reagents in organic chemistry. They are named
     systematically by adding the -ate suffix to the name of the alcohol. Methanol becomes methanolate, for instance.

     Phenols are about a million times more acidic than alcohols (TABLE 17.1). They are therefore soluble in dilute
     aqueous NaOH and can often be separated from a mixture simply by basic extraction into aqueous solution,
     followed by reacidification.

Phenols are more acidic than alcohols because the phenoxide anion is resonance-stabilized. Delocalization of

the negative charge over the ortho and para positions of the aromatic ring results in increased stability of the

phenoxide anion relative to undissociated phenol and in a consequently lower G° for dissociation. FIGURE
17.3 compares electrostatic potential maps of an alkoxide ion (CH3O-) with phenoxide ion to show how the
negative charge in phenoxide ion is delocalized from oxygen to the ring.

FIGURE 17.3 The resonance-stabilized phenoxide ion is more stable than an alkoxide ion. Electrostatic potential maps show how the
negative charge is concentrated on oxygen in the methoxide ion but is spread over the aromatic ring in the phenoxide ion.

Substituted phenols can be either more acidic or less acidic than phenol itself, depending on whether the
substituent is electron-withdrawing or electron-donating (Section 16.4). Phenols with an electron-withdrawing
substituent are more acidic because these substituents delocalize the negative charge; phenols with an
electron-donating substituent are less acidic because these substituents concentrate the charge. The acidifying
effect of an electron-withdrawing substituent is particularly noticeable in phenols with a nitro group at the ortho
or para position.

        WORKED EXAMPLE 17.1
Predicting the Relative Acidity of a Substituted Phenol

Is p-hydroxybenzaldehyde more acidic or less acidic than phenol?
Strategy
Identify the substituent on the aromatic ring, and decide whether it is electron-donating or electron-
withdrawing. Electron-withdrawing substituents make the phenol more acidic by stabilizing the phenoxide
anion, and electron-donating substituents make the phenol less acidic by destabilizing the anion.
Solution
We saw in Section 16.4 that a carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. Thus, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde is more
578  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     acidic (pKa = 7.9) than phenol (pKa = 9.89).

     17.3 Preparation of Alcohols: A Review

     Alcohols occupy a central position in organic chemistry. They can be prepared from many other kinds of
     compounds (alkenes, alkyl halides, ketones, esters, and aldehydes, among others), and they can be transformed
     into an equally wide assortment of compounds (FIGURE 17.4).

     FIGURE 17.4 The central position of alcohols in organic chemistry. Alcohols can be prepared from, and converted into, many other kinds
     of compounds.

     We've already seen several methods of alcohol synthesis:
       · Alcohols can be prepared by hydration of alkenes. Because the direct hydration of alkenes with aqueous
           acid is generally a poor reaction in the laboratory, two indirect methods are commonly used.
           Hydroboration-oxidation yields the syn, non-Markovnikov hydration product (Section 8.5), whereas
           oxymercuration-demercuration yields the Markovnikov hydration product (Section 8.4).

· 1,2-Diols can be prepared either by direct hydroxylation of an alkene with OsO4 followed by reduction with
   NaHSO3 or by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an epoxide (Section 8.7). The OsO4 reaction occurs with syn
   stereochemistry to give a cis diol, and epoxide opening occurs with anti stereochemistry to give a trans diol.

17.4 Alcohols from Carbonyl Compounds: Reduction

The most general method for preparing alcohols, both in the laboratory and in living organisms, is by reduction

of a carbonyl compound. Just as reduction of an alkene adds hydrogen to a  bond to give an alkane (Section

8.6), reduction of a carbonyl compound adds hydrogen to a  bond to give an alcohol. All kinds of carbonyl

compounds can be reduced, including aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters.
580  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones

     Aldehydes are easily reduced to give primary alcohols, and ketones are reduced to give secondary alcohols.

     Dozens of reagents are used in the laboratory to reduce aldehydes and ketones, depending on the
     circumstances, but sodium borohydride, NaBH4, is usually chosen because of its safety and ease of handling.
     Sodium borohydride is a white, crystalline solid that can be weighed in the open atmosphere and used in either
     water or alcohol solution.

     Lithium aluminum hydride, LiAlH4, is another reducing agent often used for reduction of aldehydes and
     ketones. A grayish powder that is soluble in ether and tetrahydrofuran, LiAlH4 is much more reactive than
     NaBH4 but also much more dangerous. It reacts violently with water and decomposes explosively when heated
     above 120 °C.

     We'll defer a detailed discussion of these reductions until Chapter 19. For the moment, we'll simply note that
     they involve the addition of a nucleophilic hydride ion (:H-) to the positively polarized, electrophilic carbon
     atom of the carbonyl group. The initial product is an alkoxide ion, which is protonated by addition of H3O+ in a
     second step to yield the alcohol product.

In living organisms, aldehyde and ketone reductions are carried out by either of the coenzymes NADH (reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) or NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).
Although these biological "reagents" are much more complex structurally than NaBH4 or LiAlH4, the
mechanisms of laboratory and biological reactions are similar. The coenzyme acts as a hydride-ion donor to
give an alkoxide anion, and the intermediate anion is then protonated by acid. An example is the reduction of
acetoacetyl ACP to -hydroxybutyryl ACP, a step in the biological synthesis of fats (FIGURE 17.5). Note that the
pro-R hydrogen of NADPH is the one transferred in this example. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions usually occur
with high specificity, although it's not usually possible to predict the stereochemical result before the fact.

            FIGURE 17.5 The biological reduction of a ketone (acetoacetyl ACP) to an alcohol (-hydroxybutyryl ACP) by NADPH.

Reduction of Carboxylic Acids and Esters

Carboxylic acids and esters are reduced to give primary alcohols.

These reactions aren't as rapid as the reductions of aldehydes and ketones. NaBH4 reduces esters very slowly
and does not reduce carboxylic acids at all. Instead, carboxylic acid and ester reductions are usually carried
out with the more reactive reducing agent LiAlH4. All carbonyl groups, including acids, esters, ketones, and
aldehydes, are reduced by LiAlH4. Note that one hydrogen atom is delivered to the carbonyl carbon atom
during aldehyde and ketone reductions but that two hydrogens become bonded to the former carbonyl carbon
during carboxylic acid and ester reductions. We'll defer a discussion of the mechanisms of these reactions until
Chapter 21.

17.5 Alcohols from Carbonyl Compounds: Grignard Reaction

Grignard reagents (RMgX), prepared by reaction of organohalides with magnesium (Section 10.6), react with

carbonyl compounds to yield alcohols in much the same way that hydride reducing agents do. Just as carbonyl

reduction involves addition of a hydride ion nucleophile to the  bond, Grignard reaction involves addition
of a carbanion nucleophile (R:-+MgX).

The nucleophilic addition reaction of Grignard reagents to carbonyl compounds has no direct counterpart
in biological chemistry because organomagnesium compounds are too strongly basic to exist in an aqueous
medium. Nevertheless, the reaction is worth understanding for two reasons. First, the reaction is an unusually
broad and useful method of alcohol synthesis and demonstrates again the relative freedom with which chemists
can operate in the laboratory. Second, the reaction does have an indirect biological counterpart, for we'll see
in Chapter 23 that the addition of stabilized carbon nucleophiles to carbonyl compounds is used in almost all
metabolic pathways as the major process for forming carbon-carbon bonds.

As examples of their addition to carbonyl compounds, Grignard reagents react with formaldehyde,                , to

give primary alcohols, with aldehydes to give secondary alcohols, and with ketones to give tertiary alcohols.
584  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     Esters react with Grignard reagents to yield tertiary alcohols in which two of the substituents bonded to the
     hydroxyl-bearing carbon have come from the Grignard reagent, just as LiAlH4 reduction of an ester adds two
     hydrogens.

     Carboxylic acids don't give addition products when treated directly with Grignard reagents because the acidic
     carboxyl hydrogen reacts with the basic Grignard reagent to yield a hydrocarbon and the magnesium salt of the
     acid.

     Carboxylic acids do, however, react with Grignard reagents to give ketones if they are first treated with
     i-Pr2NMgCl-LiCl, called the turbo-Hauser base, to form a complex and increase the electrophilicity of the
     carboxylate anion toward nucleophilic addition with a Grignard reagent.

The Grignard reaction, although useful, does have limitations. One major problem is that a Grignard reagent
can't be prepared from an organohalide if other reactive functional groups are present in the same molecule.
For example, a compound that is both an alkyl halide and a ketone can't form a Grignard reagent because it
would react with itself. Similarly, a compound that is both an alkyl halide and a carboxylic acid, alcohol, or
amine can't form a Grignard reagent because the acidic RCO2H, ROH, or RNH2 hydrogen present in the same
molecule would react with the basic Grignard reagent as rapidly as it forms. In general, Grignard reagents can't
be prepared from alkyl halides that contain the following functional groups (FG):

As with the reduction of carbonyl compounds discussed in the previous section, we'll defer a detailed treatment
of the Grignard reactions until Chapter 19. For the moment, it's sufficient to note that Grignard reagents act as
nucleophilic carbanions (:R-) and that their addition to a carbonyl compound is analogous to the addition of
hydride ion. The intermediate is an alkoxide ion, which is protonated by addition of H3O+ in a second step.

17.6 Reactions of Alcohols

We've already seen several reactions of alcohols--their conversion into alkyl halides and tosylates in Section
10.5 and their dehydration to give alkenes in Section 8.1--albeit without mechanistic details. Let's now look at
those details.

Conversion of Alcohols into Alkyl Halides

Tertiary alcohols react with either HCl or HBr at 0 °C by an SN1 mechanism through a carbocation intermediate.
Primary and secondary alcohols are much more resistant to acid, however, and are best converted into halides
by treatment with either SOCl2 or PBr3 through an SN2 mechanism.
The reaction of a tertiary alcohol with HX takes place by an SN1 mechanism when acid protonates the hydroxyl
oxygen atom. Water is expelled to generate a carbocation, and the cation reacts with nucleophilic halide ion to
give the alkyl halide product.

The reactions of primary and secondary alcohols with SOCl2 and PBr3 take place by SN2 mechanisms.
Hydroxide ion itself is too poor a leaving group to be displaced by nucleophiles in SN2 reactions, but reaction of
an alcohol with SOCl2 or PBr3 converts the -OH into a much better leaving group, either a chlorosulfite (-OSOCl)
or a dibromophosphite (-OPBr2), which is readily expelled by backside nucleophilic substitution.

Conversion of Alcohols into Tosylates

Alcohols react with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (tosyl chloride, p-TosCl) in pyridine solution to yield alkyl
588  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     tosylates, ROTos (Section 11.1). Only the O-H bond of the alcohol is broken in this reaction; the C-O bond
     remains intact, so no change of configuration occurs if the oxygen is attached to a chirality center. The resultant
     alkyl tosylates behave much like alkyl halides, undergoing both SN1 and SN2 substitution reactions.

     One of the most important reasons for using tosylates in SN2 reactions is stereochemical. The SN2 reaction of
     an alcohol with an alkyl halide proceeds with two inversions of configuration--one to make the halide from the
     alcohol and one to substitute the halide--and yields a product with the same stereochemistry as the starting
     alcohol. The SN2 reaction of an alcohol with a tosylate, however, proceeds with only one inversion and yields a
     product of opposite stereochemistry to the starting alcohol. FIGURE 17.6 shows a series of reactions on the R
     enantiomer of 2-octanol that illustrates these stereochemical relationships.

     FIGURE 17.6 Stereochemical consequences of SN2 reactions on derivatives of (R)-2-octanol. Substitution through the halide gives
     a product with the same stereochemistry as the starting alcohol; substitution through the tosylate gives a product with opposite
     stereochemistry to the starting alcohol.

     Dehydration of Alcohols to Yield Alkenes

     A third important reaction of alcohols, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways, is their dehydration
     to give alkenes. Because of the usefulness of the reaction, a number of methods have been devised for carrying
     out dehydrations. One method that works particularly well for tertiary alcohols is the acid-catalyzed reaction
     discussed in Section 8.1. For example, treatment of 1-methylcyclohexanol with warm, aqueous sulfuric acid in
     a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran results in loss of water and formation of 1-methylcyclohexene.

     Acid-catalyzed dehydrations usually follow Zaitsev's rule (Section 11.7) and yield the more stable alkene as
     the major product. Thus, 2-methyl-2-butanol gives primarily 2-methyl-2-butene (trisubstituted double bond)

rather than 2-methyl-1-butene (disubstituted double bond).

This reaction is an E1 process (Section 11.10) and occurs by the three-step mechanism shown in FIGURE 17.7
on the next page. Protonation of the alcohol oxygen is followed by unimolecular loss of water to generate a
carbocation intermediate and final loss of a proton from the neighboring carbon atom to complete the process.
As with most E1 reactions, tertiary alcohols react fastest because they lead to stabilized, tertiary carbocation
intermediates. Secondary alcohols can be made to react, but the conditions are severe (75% H2SO4, 100 °C) and
sensitive molecules don't survive.

                      FIGURE 17.7 MECHANISM

To circumvent the need for strong acid and allow the dehydration of secondary alcohols in a gentler way,
reagents have been developed that are effective under mild, basic conditions. One such reagent, phosphorus
oxychloride (POCl3) in the basic amine solvent pyridine, is often able to effect the dehydration of secondary and
590  17 · Alcohols and Phenols

     tertiary alcohols at 0 °C.

     Alcohol dehydrations carried out with POCl3 in pyridine take place by an E2 mechanism, as shown in FIGURE
     17.8. Because hydroxide ion is a poor leaving group (Section 11.3), direct E2 elimination of water from an
     alcohol does not occur. On reaction with POCl3, however, the -OH group is converted into a dichlorophosphate
     (-OPOCl2), which is a good leaving group and is readily eliminated. Pyridine is both the reaction solvent and the
     base that removes a neighboring proton in the E2 elimination step.

     As noted in Section 11.11, biological dehydrations are also common and usually occur by an E1cB mechanism
     on a substrate in which the -OH group is two carbons away from a carbonyl group. One example occurs in the
     biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. A base (:B) first abstracts a proton from the carbon adjacent
     to the carbonyl group, and the anion intermediate then expels the -OH group with simultaneous protonation by
     an acid (HA) to form water.

Conversion of Alcohols into Esters

Alcohols react with carboxylic acids to give esters, a reaction that is common in both the laboratory and living
organisms. In the laboratory, the reaction can be carried out in a single step if a strong acid is used as catalyst.
More frequently, though, the reactivity of the carboxylic acid is enhanced by first converting it into a carboxylic
acid chloride, which then reacts with the alcohol.

In living organisms, a similar process occurs, though a thioester or acyl adenosyl phosphate acts as substrate
rather than a carboxylic acid chloride. We'll look at the mechanisms of these reactions in Chapter 21.

     17.7 Oxidation of Alcohols

     Perhaps the most valuable reaction of alcohols is their oxidation to give carbonyl compounds--the opposite of
     the reduction of carbonyl compounds to give alcohols. Primary alcohols are oxidized either to aldehydes or
     carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones, but tertiary alcohols don't normally react with
     most oxidizing agents.

     Primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidized by any of a number of reagents, including CrO3 in aqueous
     acetic acid and KMnO4 in aqueous NaOH, but chromium-based reagents are rarely used today because of
     their toxicity and fire danger. Today, primary and secondary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes and ketones,

     respectively, using the iodine-containing Dess-Martin periodinane in dichloromethane solution.

     Primary alcohols are oxidized to carboxylic acids by heating with KMnO4 in a basic aqueous solution. An
     aldehyde is involved as an intermediate in the KMnO4 reaction but can't usually be isolated because it is further
     oxidized too rapidly.

     All these oxidations occur by a mechanism that is closely related to the E2 reaction (Section 11.8). In the
     Dess-Martin oxidation, for instance, the first step involves a substitution reaction between the alcohol and the
     I(V) reagent to form a new periodinane intermediate, followed by expulsion of reduced I(III) as the leaving
     group. Similarly, when a Cr(VI) reagent, such as CrO3, is the oxidant, reaction with the alcohol gives a chromate

                                                                       17.7 · Oxidation of Alcohols                               593

intermediate followed by expulsion of a reduced Cr(VI) species.

Biological alcohol oxidations are the opposite of biological carbonyl reductions and are facilitated by the
coenzymes NAD+ and NADP+. A base removes the -OH proton, and the alkoxide ion transfers a hydride ion to

the coenzyme. An example is the oxidation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a step in
the biological metabolism of fats (FIGURE 17.9). Note that addition occurs exclusively on the Re face of the NAD+

ring, adding a hydrogen with pro-R stereochemistry.

mechanism is the exact opposite of the ketone reduction shown previously in FIGURE 17.5.

     17.8 Protection of Alcohols

     It often happens, particularly during the synthesis of complex molecules, that one functional group in a
     molecule interferes with an intended reaction on another functional group elsewhere in the same molecule. We
     saw earlier in this chapter, for instance, that a Grignard reagent can't be prepared from an alcohol-containing
     halidel because the C-Mg bond is not compatible with the presence of an acidic -OH group in the same
     molecule.

     When this kind of incompatibility arises, it's sometimes possible to circumvent the problem by protecting the
     interfering functional group. Protection involves three steps: (1) introducing a protecting group to block the
     interfering function, (2) carrying out the desired reaction, and (3) removing the protecting group.

     One of the more common methods of alcohol protection involves reaction with a chlorotrialkylsilane, Cl-SiR3,
     to yield a trialkylsilyl ether, R-O-SiR3. (Chloro-tert-butyldimethylsilane), usually abbreviated either TBS or
     TBDMS is often used, as is chlorotrimethylsilane (TMS), and the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base,
     such as triethylamine, to help form the alkoxide anion from the alcohol and to remove the HCl by-product from
     the reaction.

     The ether-forming step is an SN2-like reaction of the alkoxide ion on the silicon atom, with concurrent loss of
     the leaving chloride anion. Unlike most SN2 reactions, though, this reaction takes place at a tertiary center--a
     trialkyl-substituted silicon atom. The reaction occurs because silicon, a third-row atom, is larger than carbon
     and forms longer bonds. In addition, three alkyl substituents attached to silicon offer little steric hindrance to
     ether formation.

Like most other ethers, which we'll study in the next chapter, trialkylsilylethers are relatively unreactive. They
have no acidic hydrogens and don't react with oxidizing agents, reducing agents, or Grignard reagents. They do,
however, react with aqueous acid or with fluoride ion to regenerate the alcohol. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride
is often used.

To solve the problem posed at the beginning of this section, note that it's possible to use an alcohol-containing
halide in a Grignard reaction by employing a protection sequence. For example, we can add
3-bromo-1-propanol to acetaldehyde by the route shown in FIGURE 17.10.

     17.9 Phenols and Their Uses

     The outbreak of World War I provided a stimulus for the industrial preparation of large amounts of synthetic
     phenol, which was needed as a raw material to manufacture the explosive, picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol).
     Today, approximately 132 million tons of phenol is manufactured worldwide each year for use in such products
     as Bakelite resin and adhesives for binding plywood.

     Phenol was manufactured for many years by the Dow process, in which chlorobenzene reacts with NaOH at
     high temperature and pressure (Section 16.7). Now, however, an alternative synthesis uses isopropylbenzene,
     commonly called cumene. Cumene reacts with air at high temperature by benzylic oxidation through a radical
     mechanism to form cumene hydroperoxide, which is converted into phenol and acetone by treatment with acid.
     This is a particularly efficient process because two valuable chemicals are prepared at the same time.

     As shown in FIGURE 17.11, the reaction occurs by protonation of oxygen followed by shift of the phenyl group
     from carbon to oxygen with simultaneous loss of water. Replacement of the water then yields an intermediate
     called a hemiacetal--a compound that contains one -OR group and one -OH group bonded to the same carbon
     atom--which breaks down to phenol and acetone.

FIGURE 17.11 MECHANISM

Mechanism for the formation of phenol by acid-catalyzed rearrangement of

In addition to its use in making resins and adhesives, phenol is also the starting material for the synthesis
of chlorinated phenols and the food preservatives BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and BHA (butylated
hydroxyanisole). Pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative, is prepared by reaction of phenol with
excess Cl2. The herbicide 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is prepared from 2,4-dichlorophenol, and the
hospital antiseptic agent hexachlorophene is prepared from 2,4,5-trichlorophenol.

     The food preservative BHT is prepared by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of p-methylphenol (p-cresol) with

     17.10 Reactions of Phenols

     Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions

     The hydroxyl group is a strongly activating, ortho- and para-directing substituent in electrophilic aromatic
     substitution reactions (Section 16.4). As a result, phenols are highly reactive substrates for electrophilic
     halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and Friedel-Crafts reactions.

     Oxidation of Phenols: Quinones

     Phenols don't undergo oxidation in the same way as alcohols because they don't have a hydrogen atom on the
     hydroxyl-bearing carbon. Instead, oxidation of a phenol yields a 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione, or quinone.
     Many different oxidizing agents will accomplish the transformation, but potassium nitrosodisulfonate
     [(KSO3)2NO], called Fremy's salt, is often used.

     Quinones are a valuable class of compounds because of their oxidation-reduction, or redox, properties. They
     can be easily reduced to hydroquinones (p-dihydroxybenzenes) by reagents such as NaBH4 and SnCl2, and
     hydroquinones can be easily reoxidized back to quinones.

The redox properties of quinones are crucial to the functioning of living cells, where compounds called
ubiquinones act as biochemical oxidizing agents to mediate the electron-transfer processes involved in energy
production. Ubiquinones, also called coenzymes Q, are components of the cells in all aerobic organisms, from
the simplest bacterium to humans. They are so named because of their ubiquitous occurrence throughout
nature.

Ubiquinones function within the mitochondria of cells to mediate the respiration process in which electrons are
transported from the biological reducing agent NADH to molecular oxygen. Through a complex series of steps,
the ultimate result is a cycle whereby NADH is oxidized to NAD+, O2 is reduced to water, and energy is produced.
Ubiquinone acts only as an intermediary and is itself unchanged.

Infrared Spectroscopy

Alcohols have a strong C-O stretching absorption near 1050 cm-1 and a characteristic O-H stretching
absorption at 3300 to 3600 cm-1. The exact position of the O-H stretch depends on the extent of hydrogen-
bonding in the molecule. Unassociated alcohols show a fairly sharp absorption near 3600 cm-1, whereas
hydrogen-bonded alcohols show a broader absorption in the 3300 to 3400 cm-1 range. The hydrogen-bonded
hydroxyl absorption appears at 3350 cm-1 in the IR spectrum of cyclohexanol (FIGURE 17.12).

occur in the range 3.4 to 4.5 . Spin-spin splitting, however, is not usually observed between the O-H proton of
an alcohol and the neighboring protons on carbon. Most samples contain small amounts of acidic impurities,
which catalyze an exchange of the O-H proton on a timescale so rapid that the effect of spin-spin splitting is
removed. It's often possible to take advantage of this rapid proton exchange to identify the position of the O-H
absorption. If a small amount of deuterated water, D2O, is added to an NMR sample tube, the O-H proton is
rapidly exchanged for deuterium and the hydroxyl absorption disappears from the spectrum.

Typical spin-spin splitting is observed between protons on the oxygen-bearing carbon and other neighbors.
For example, the signal of the two -CH2O- protons in 1-propanol is split into a triplet by coupling with the
neighboring -CH2- protons (FIGURE 17.14).

FIGURE 17.14 1H NMR spectrum of 1-propanol. The protons on the oxygen-bearing carbon are split into a triplet at 3.58 .

Phenols, like all aromatic compounds, show 1H NMR absorptions near 7 to 8 , the expected position for
aromatic-ring protons (Section 15.7). In addition, phenol O-H protons absorb at 3 to 8 . In neither case are

these absorptions uniquely diagnostic for phenols, since other kinds of protons absorb in the same range.

PROBLEM      When the 1H NMR spectrum of an alcohol is run in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent rather than
      17-19  in chloroform, exchange of the O-H proton is slow and spin-spin splitting is seen between the O-H
             proton and C-H protons on the adjacent carbon. What spin multiplicities would you expect for the

Mass Spectrometry

As noted in Section 12.3, alcohols undergo fragmentation in the mass spectrometer by two characteristic
pathways, alpha cleavage and dehydration. In the alpha-cleavage pathway, a C-C bond nearest the hydroxyl
group is broken, yielding a neutral radical plus a resonance-stabilized, oxygen-containing cation.

In the dehydration pathway, water is eliminated, yielding an alkene radical cation.

Both fragmentation modes are apparent in the mass spectrum of 1-butanol (FIGURE 17.15). The peak at m/z =
56 is due to loss of water from the molecular ion, and the peak at m/z = 31 is due to an alpha cleavage.

Ethanol: Chemical, Drug, and Poison

The production of ethanol by fermentation of grains and sugars is one of the oldest known organic reactions,
going back at least 8000 years in the Middle East and perhaps as many as 9000 years in China. Fermentation
is carried out by adding yeast to an aqueous sugar solution, where enzymes break down carbohydrates into
ethanol and CO2. As noted in the chapter introduction, approximately 26 billion gallons of ethanol is produced
each year by fermentation of corn and sugar, with essentially the entire amount used to make bus and
automobile fuel.

Ethanol is classified medically as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Its effects--that is, being
drunk--resemble the human response to anesthetics. There is an initial excitability and increase in sociable
behavior, but this results from depression of inhibition rather than from stimulation. At a blood alcohol
concentration of 0.1% to 0.3%, motor coordination is affected, accompanied by loss of balance, slurred speech,
and amnesia. When blood alcohol concentration rises to between 0.3% and 0.4%, nausea and loss of
consciousness occur. Above 0.6%, spontaneous respiration and cardiovascular regulation are affected,
ultimately leading to death. The LD50 of ethanol is 10.6 g/kg (Chapter 1 Chemistry Matters).
The passage of ethanol through the body begins with its absorption in the stomach and small intestine, followed
by rapid distribution to all body fluids and organs. In the pituitary gland, ethanol inhibits the production of
a hormone that regulates urine flow, causing increased urine production and dehydration. In the stomach,
ethanol stimulates production of acid. Throughout the body, ethanol causes blood vessels to dilate, resulting in
flushing of the skin and a sensation of warmth as blood moves into capillaries beneath the surface. The result is
not a warming of the body, but an increased loss of heat at the surface.

Ethanol metabolism occurs mainly in the liver and proceeds by oxidation in two steps, first to acetaldehyde
(CH3CHO) and then to acetic acid (CH3CO2H). When continuously present in the body, ethanol and acetaldehyde
are toxic, leading to the devastating physical and metabolic deterioration seen in people with chronic alcohol
use disorder. The liver usually suffers the worst damage since it is the major site of alcohol metabolism.
Approximately 17,000 people are killed each year in the United States in alcohol-related automobile accidents.
Thus, all 50 states have made it illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above 0.08%.

Fortunately, simple tests have been devised for measuring blood alcohol concentration. The original breath
analyzer test measured alcohol concentration in expired air by the color change occurring when the bright-
orange oxidizing agent potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) reduced to blue-green chromium(III). Current
consumer devices use a conductivity sensor, and tests used by law-enforcement agencies use IR spectroscopy
to measure blood-alcohol levels in expired air. Just breathe into the machine, and let the spectrum tell the tale.

Summary

In previous chapters, we focused on developing general ideas of organic reactivity, looking at the chemistry of
hydrocarbons and alkyl halides and seeing some of the tools used in structural studies. With that accomplished,
we have now begun to study the oxygen-containing functional groups that lie at the heart of organic and
biological chemistry.

Alcohols are among the most versatile of all organic compounds. They occur widely in nature, are important
industrially, and have an unusually rich chemistry. The most widely used methods of alcohol synthesis start
with carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids are reduced by reaction with LiAlH4 to give
primary alcohols (RCH2OH); ketones are reduced to yield secondary alcohols (R2CHOH).

Alcohols are also prepared by reaction of carbonyl compounds with Grignard reagents, RMgX. Addition of a
Grignard reagent to formaldehyde yields a primary alcohol, addition to an aldehyde yields a secondary alcohol,
and addition to a ketone or an ester yields a tertiary alcohol. The Grignard reaction is limited by the fact that
Grignard reagents can't be prepared from alkyl halides that contain reactive functional groups in the same
molecule. This problem can sometimes be avoided by protecting the interfering functional group. Alcohols are
often protected by formation of trialkylsilyl ethers.

Alcohols undergo many reactions and can be converted into many other functional groups. They can be
dehydrated to give alkenes by treatment with POCl3 and can be transformed into alkyl halides by treatment
with PBr3 or SOCl2. Furthermore, alcohols are weakly acidic (pKa  16-18) and react with strong bases and
with alkali metals to form alkoxide anions, which are used frequently in organic synthesis. Perhaps the most
important reaction of alcohols is their oxidation to carbonyl compounds. Primary alcohols yield either
aldehydes or carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols yield ketones, but tertiary alcohols are not normally oxidized.

Phenols are aromatic counterparts of alcohols but are more acidic (pKa  10) because their corresponding
phenoxide anions are resonance stabilized by delocalization of the negative charge into the aromatic ring.
Substitution of the aromatic ring by an electron-withdrawing group increases phenol acidity, and substitution
by an electron-donating group decreases acidity. Phenols can be oxidized to quinones, and quinones can be
reduced back to hydroquinones.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? This chapter finishes the coverage of functional groups with C-O and C-S single bonds

that was begun in the chapter on Alcohols and Phenols. We'll focus primarily on ethers and take only a brief look

at thiols and sulfides before going on to an extensive coverage of compounds with  double bonds in

Chapters 19 through 23.

Ethers (R-O-R), like the alcohols we saw in the preceding chapter, are organic derivatives of water, but they
have two organic groups bonded to the same oxygen atom rather than one. The organic groups might be alkyl,
aryl, or vinylic, and the oxygen atom might be in an open chain or a ring.

Perhaps the most well-known ether is diethyl ether, which has a long history of medicinal use as an anesthetic
and industrial use as a solvent. Other useful ethers include anisole, a pleasant-smelling aromatic ether used in
perfumery, and tetrahydrofuran (THF), a cyclic ether often used as a solvent.
620  18 · Ethers and Epoxides; Thiols and Sulfides

     Thiols (R-S-H) and sulfides (R-S-R) are sulfur analogs of alcohols and ethers, respectively. Both functional
     groups are found in various biomolecules, although not as commonly as their oxygen-containing relatives.

     18.1 Names and Properties of Ethers

     Simple ethers with no other functional groups are named by identifying the two organic substituents and
     adding the word ether.

     If other functional groups are present, the ether part is considered an alkoxy substituent. For example:

     Like alcohols, ethers have nearly the same geometry as water. The R-O-R bonds have an approximately
     tetrahedral bond angle (112° in dimethyl ether), and the oxygen atom is sp3-hybridized.

     The electronegative oxygen atom gives ethers a slight dipole moment, and the boiling points of ethers are often
     slightly higher than the boiling points of comparable alkanes. TABLE 18.1 compares the boiling points of some
     common ethers and their corresponding hydrocarbons.

     TABLE 18.1 Comparison of Boiling Points of Ethers and Hydrocarbons

Ethers are relatively stable and unreactive in many respects, but some ethers react slowly with the oxygen in
air to give peroxides, compounds that contain an O-O bond. The peroxides from low-molecular-weight ethers
such as diisopropyl ether and tetrahydrofuran are explosive and extremely dangerous, even in small amounts.
Ethers are very useful as solvents in the laboratory, but they must always be used cautiously and should not be
stored for long periods of time.

18.2 Preparing Ethers

Diethyl ether and other simple symmetrical ethers are prepared industrially by the sulfuric-acid-catalyzed
reaction of alcohols. The reaction occurs by SN2 displacement of water from a protonated ethanol molecule by
the oxygen atom of a second ethanol. Unfortunately, this method is limited to use with primary alcohols because
secondary and tertiary alcohols dehydrate by an E1 mechanism to yield alkenes (Section 17.6).

The Williamson Ether Synthesis

The most generally useful method of preparing ethers is the Williamson ether synthesis, in which an alkoxide
ion reacts with a primary alkyl halide or tosylate in an SN2 reaction. As we saw in Section 17.2, the alkoxide ion
is normally prepared by reaction of an alcohol with a strong base such as sodium hydride, NaH.

A useful variation of the Williamson synthesis involves silver oxide, Ag2O, as a mild base rather than NaH. Under
these conditions, the free alcohol reacts directly with the alkyl halide, so there is no need to preform the metal
622  18 · Ethers and Epoxides; Thiols and Sulfides

     alkoxide intermediate. Sugars react particularly well; glucose, for example, reacts with excess iodomethane in
     the presence of Ag2O to generate a pentaether in 85% yield.

     Because the Williamson synthesis is an SN2 reaction, it is subject to all the usual constraints, as discussed
     in Section 11.3. Primary halides and tosylates work best because competitive E2 elimination can occur with
     more hindered substrates. Unsymmetrical ethers should therefore be synthesized by reaction between the
     more hindered alkoxide partner and less hindered halide partner rather than vice versa. For example, tert-butyl
     methyl ether, a substance used in the 1990s as an octane booster in gasoline, is best prepared by reaction of
     tert-butoxide ion with iodomethane rather than by reaction of methoxide ion with 2-chloro-2-methylpropane.

     PROBLEM       Why do you suppose only symmetrical ethers are prepared by the sulfuric-acid-catalyzed
             18-2  dehydration procedure? What product(s) would you expect if ethanol and 1-propanol were allowed
                   to react together? In what ratio would the products be formed if the two alcohols were of equal

     Alkoxymercuration of Alkenes

     We saw in Section 8.4 that alkenes react with water in the presence of mercuric acetate to yield a
     hydroxymercuration product. Subsequent treatment with NaBH4 breaks the C-Hg bond and yields the alcohol.
     A similar alkoxymercuration reaction occurs when an alkene is treated with an alcohol in the presence
     of mercuric acetate or, even better, mercuric trifluoroacetate, (CF3CO2)2Hg. Demercuration by reaction with
     NaBH4 then yields an ether. The net result is Markovnikov addition of the alcohol to the alkene.

The mechanism of the alkoxymercuration reaction is similar to that described in Section 8.4 for
hydroxymercuration. The reaction is initiated by electrophilic addition of Hg2+ to the alkene, followed by
reaction of the intermediate cation with alcohol and reduction of the C-Hg bond by NaBH4. A variety of alcohols
and alkenes can be used in alkoxymercuration. Primary, secondary, and even tertiary alcohols react well, but
ditertiary ethers can't be prepared because of steric hindrance.

     18.3 Reactions of Ethers: Acidic Cleavage

     Ethers are unreactive to many reagents used in organic chemistry, a property that accounts for their wide use as
     reaction solvents. Halogens, dilute acids, bases, and nucleophiles have no effect on most ethers. In fact, ethers
     undergo only one truly general reaction--they are cleaved by strong acids. Aqueous HBr and HI both work well,
     but HCl does not cleave ethers.

     Acidic ether cleavages are typical nucleophilic substitution reactions and take place by either SN1 or SN2
     mechanisms, depending on the structure of the substrate. Ethers with only primary and secondary alkyl groups
     react by an SN2 mechanism, in which I- or Br- reacts with the protonated ether at the less hindered site. This
     usually results in a selective cleavage into a single alcohol and a single alkyl halide. For example, ethyl isopropyl

     ether exclusively yields isopropyl alcohol and iodoethane on cleavage by HI because nucleophilic attack by

     iodide ion occurs at the less hindered primary site rather than at the more hindered secondary site.

     Ethers with a tertiary, benzylic, or allylic group cleave by either an SN1 or E1 mechanism because these
     substrates can produce stable intermediate carbocations. These reactions are often fast and take place at
     moderate temperatures. tert-Butyl ethers, for example, react by an E1 mechanism on treatment with
     trifluoroacetic acid at 0 °C. We'll see in Section 26.7 that this reaction is often used in the laboratory synthesis
     of peptides.

18.4 Cyclic Ethers: Epoxides

For the most part, cyclic ethers behave like acyclic ethers. The chemistry of the ether functional group is the
same, whether it's in an open chain or in a ring. Common cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane are
often used as solvents because of their inertness, yet they can be cleaved by strong acids.

The one group of cyclic ethers that behaves differently from open-chain ethers are the three-membered-ring
compounds called epoxides, or oxiranes, which we saw in Section 8.7. The strain of the three-membered ring
gives epoxides unique chemical reactivity.

Ethylene oxide, the simplest epoxide, is an intermediate in the manufacture of both ethylene glycol, used for
automobile antifreeze, and polyester polymers. Approximately 37 million tons of ethylene oxide is produced
worldwide each year, most of it by air oxidation of ethylene over a silver oxide catalyst at 300 °C. This process is
not useful for other epoxides, however, and is of little value in the laboratory.

Note that the name ethylene oxide is not a systematic one because the -ene ending implies the presence of a
double bond in the molecule. The name is frequently used, however, because ethylene oxide is derived from
ethylene by addition of an oxygen atom. Other simple epoxides are named similarly. The systematic name for
ethylene oxide is 1,2-epoxyethane.

In the laboratory, as we saw in Section 8.7, epoxides are usually prepared by treatment of an alkene with a
626  18 · Ethers and Epoxides; Thiols and Sulfides

     peroxyacid (RCO3H), typically m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid.

     Epoxides can also be prepared from halohydrins, themselves produced by electrophilic addition of Cl2 or Br2 to
     an alkene in the presence of water (Section 8.3). When a halohydrin is treated with base, HX is eliminated and
     an epoxide is produced by an intramolecular Williamson ether synthesis. That is, the nucleophilic alkoxide ion
     and the electrophilic alkyl halide are in the same molecule.

     18.5 Reactions of Epoxides: Ring-Opening

     Acid-Catalyzed Epoxide Opening

     Epoxides are cleaved by treatment with acid just as other ethers are, but under much milder conditions because
     of ring strain. As we saw in Section 8.7, dilute aqueous acid at room temperature is sufficient for facilitating the
     hydrolysis of epoxides to give 1,2-diols, also called vicinal glycols. (The word vicinal means "adjacent," and a
     glycol is a diol.) The epoxide cleavage takes place by SN2-like backside attack of a nucleophile on the protonated
     epoxide, giving a trans-1,2-diol as product.

     Epoxides can also be opened by reaction with acids other than H3O+. If anhydrous HX is used, for instance, an
     epoxide is converted into a trans halohydrin.

18.5 · Reactions of Epoxides: Ring-Opening                                                                         627

The regiochemistry of acid-catalyzed ring-opening depends on the epoxide's structure, and a mixture of
products is often formed. When both epoxide carbon atoms are either primary or secondary, attack of the
nucleophile occurs primarily at the less highly substituted site: an SN2-like result. When one of the epoxide
carbon atoms is tertiary, however, nucleophilic attack occurs primarily at the more highly substituted site--an
SN1-like result. Thus, 1,2-epoxypropane reacts with HCl to give primarily 1-chloro-2-propanol, but
2-methyl-1,2-epoxypropane gives 2-chloro-2-methyl-1- propanol as the major product.

The mechanisms of these acid-catalyzed epoxide openings are more complex than they initially appear. They
seem to be neither purely SN1 nor SN2 but instead to be midway between the two extremes and to have
characteristics of both. For instance, take the reaction of 1,2-epoxy-1-methylcyclohexane with HBr, shown in
FIGURE 18.2. The reaction yields only a single stereoisomer of 2-bromo-2-methylcyclohexanol in which the -Br
and -OH groups are trans, an SN2-like result caused by backside displacement of the epoxide oxygen. But the
fact that Br- attacks the more hindered tertiary side of the epoxide rather than the less hindered secondary side
is an SN1-like result in which the more stable, tertiary carbocation is involved.

Evidently, the transition state for acid-catalyzed epoxide opening has an SN2-like geometry but also has a high
degree of SN1-like carbocationic character. Because the positive charge in the protonated epoxide is shared by
the more highly substituted carbon atom, backside attack of Br- occurs at the more highly substituted site.

     FIGURE 18.2 Ring-opening of 1,2-epoxy-1-methylcyclohexane with HBr. There is a high degree of SN1-like carbocation character in the

Base-Catalyzed Epoxide Opening

Unlike other ethers, epoxide rings can be cleaved by bases and nucleophiles as well as by acid. Although
an ether oxygen is normally a poor leaving group in an SN2 reaction (Section 11.3), the strain of the three-
membered ring causes epoxides to react with hydroxide ion at elevated temperatures.

Base-catalyzed epoxide opening is a typical SN2 reaction in which attack of the nucleophile takes place at the
less hindered epoxide carbon. For example, 1,2-epoxypropane reacts with ethoxide ion exclusively at the less
highly substituted, primary carbon to give 1-ethoxy-2-propanol.

Many different nucleophiles can be used for epoxide opening, including amines (RNH2 or R2NH) and Grignard
reagents (RMgX). An example of an amine reacting with an epoxide occurs in the commercial synthesis of
metoprolol, a so-called -blocker that is used for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and heart
attacks. -Blockers are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world.

A similar nucleophilic ring-opening occurs when epoxides are treated with Grignard reagents. Ethylene oxide is
frequently used, thereby allowing the conversion of a Grignard reagent into a primary alcohol having two more
carbons than the starting alkyl halide. 1-Bromobutane, for example, is converted into 1-hexanol by reaction of
its Grignard reagent with ethylene oxide.

     18.6 Crown Ethers

     Crown ethers, discovered in the early 1960s by Charles Pedersen at the DuPont Company, are a relatively recent
     addition to the ether family. They are named according to the general format x-crown-y, where x is the total
     number of atoms in the ring and y is the number of oxygen atoms. Thus, 18-crown-6 ether is an 18-membered
     ring containing 6 ether oxygen atoms. Note the size and negative (red) character of the crown ether cavity in the
     following electrostatic potential map.

     The importance of crown ethers stems from their ability to sequester specific metal cations in the center
     of the polyether cavity. 18-Crown-6, for example, binds strongly with potassium ion. As a result, a solution
     of 18-crown-6 in a nonpolar organic solvent will dissolve many potassium salts. Potassium permanganate,
     KMnO4, dissolves in toluene in the presence of 18-crown-6, for instance, and the resulting solution is a valuable
     reagent for oxidizing alkenes.
     The effect of using a crown ether to dissolve an inorganic salt in a hydrocarbon or ether solvent is similar
     to the effect of dissolving the salt in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMSO, DMF, or HMPA (Section 11.3). In
     both cases, the metal cation is strongly solvated, leaving the anion bare. Thus, the SN2 reactivity of an anion is
     tremendously enhanced in the presence of a crown ether.
     Although crown ethers do not occur naturally, a group of compounds called ionophores have similar ion-
     binding properties. Produced by various microorganisms, ionophores are fat-soluble molecules that bind to
     specific ions and facilitate transport of the ions through biological membranes. The antibiotic valinomycin, for
     instance, binds specifically to K+ ions with a ten-thousandfold selectivity over Na+.

18.7 Thiols and Sulfides

Thiols

Thiols, also called mercaptans, are sulfur analogs of alcohols. They are named by the same system used for
alcohols, with the suffix -thiol used in place of -ol. The -SH group itself is referred to as a mercapto group. Like
alcohols, thiols are weakly acidic; the pKa of CH3SH, for instance, is 10.3. Unlike alcohols, however, thiols don't
typically form hydrogen bonds because the sulfur atom is not sufficiently electronegative.

The most striking characteristic of thiols is their appalling odor. Skunk scent, for instance, is caused primarily
by the simple thiols 3-methyl-1-butanethiol and 2-butene-1-thiol. Volatile thiols such as ethanethiol are also
added to natural gas and liquefied propane to serve as an easily detectable warning in case of leaks.

Thiols are usually prepared from alkyl halides by SN2 displacement with a sulfur nucleophile such as
hydrosulfide anion, -SH.

The reaction often works poorly unless an excess of the nucleophile is used because the product thiol can

undergo a second SN2 reaction with alkyl halide to give a sulfide (R-S-R) as by-product. To circumvent this

problem, thiourea,  , is often used as the nucleophile in the preparation of a thiol from an alkyl

halide. The reaction occurs by displacement of the halide ion to yield an intermediate alkyl isothiourea salt,

which is hydrolyzed by subsequent reaction with aqueous base.
632  18 · Ethers and Epoxides; Thiols and Sulfides

     Thiols can be oxidized by Br2 or I2 to yield disulfides (R-S-S-R). The reaction is easily reversed, and a disulfide
     can be reduced back to a thiol by treatment with zinc and acid.

     This thiol-disulfide interconversion is a key part of numerous biological processes. We'll see in Chapter 26, for
     instance, that disulfide formation is involved in defining the structure and three-dimensional conformations
     of proteins, where disulfide "bridges" often form cross-links between cysteine amino-acid units in the protein
     chains. Disulfide formation is also involved in the process by which cells protect themselves from oxidative
     degradation. A cellular component called glutathione removes potentially harmful oxidants and is itself
     oxidized to glutathione disulfide in the process. Reduction back to the thiol requires the coenzyme reduced
     flavin adenine dinucleotide, abbreviated FADH2.

     Sulfides

     Sulfides are the sulfur analogs of ethers just as thiols are the sulfur analogs of alcohols. Sulfides are named by
     following the same rules used for ethers, with sulfide used in place of ether for simple compounds and alkylthio
     used in place of alkoxy for more complex substances.

     Treatment of a thiol with a base, such as NaH, gives the corresponding thiolate ion (RS-), which undergoes
     reaction with a primary or secondary alkyl halide to give a sulfide. The reaction occurs by an SN2 mechanism,
     analogous to the Williamson synthesis of ethers (Section 18.2).

     Access for free at openstax.org
18.7 · Thiols and Sulfides                                                                                          633

Despite their close structural similarity, sulfides and ethers differ substantially in their chemistry. Because
the valence electrons on sulfur are farther from the nucleus and are less tightly held than those on oxygen
(3p electrons versus 2p electrons), sulfur compounds are more nucleophilic than their oxygen analogs. Unlike
dialkyl ethers, dialkyl sulfides react rapidly with primary alkyl halides by an SN2 mechanism to give sulfonium
ions (R3S+).

The most common example of this process in living organisms is the reaction of the amino acid methionine with
adenosine triphosphate (ATP; Section 6.8) to give S-adenosylmethionine. The reaction is somewhat unusual in
that the biological leaving group in this SN2 process is the triphosphate ion rather than the more frequently seen
diphosphate ion (Section 11.6).

Sulfonium ions are themselves useful alkylating agents because a nucleophile can attack one of the groups
bonded to the positively charged sulfur, displacing a neutral sulfide as leaving group. We saw an example of this
in Section 11.6 (FIGURE 11.17), in which S-adenosylmethionine transferred a methyl group to norepinephrine
to give adrenaline.
Another difference between sulfides and ethers is that sulfides are easily oxidized. Treatment of a sulfide
with hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, at room temperature yields the corresponding sulfoxide (R2SO), and further
oxidation of the sulfoxide with a peroxyacid yields a sulfone (R2SO2).

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a particularly well-known sulfoxide that is often used as a polar aprotic solvent.
It must be handled with care, however, because it has a remarkable ability to penetrate the skin, carrying along
whatever is dissolved in it.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

Hydrogens on carbon next to an ether oxygen are shifted downfield from the normal alkane resonance and show
1H NMR absorptions in the region 3.4 to 4.5 . This downfield shift is clearly seen in the spectrum of dipropyl
ether shown in FIGURE 18.5.

             FIGURE 18.5 The 1H NMR spectrum of dipropyl ether. Protons on carbon next to oxygen are shifted downfield to 3.4 .

Epoxides absorb at a slightly higher field than other ethers and show characteristic resonances at 2.5 to 3.5
 in their 1H NMR spectra, as indicated for 1,2-epoxypropane in FIGURE 18.6. The methylene protons of this
epoxide are diastereotopic, and display complex splitting (see Section 13.7 and Section 13.8).

Ether carbon atoms also exhibit a downfield shift in the 13C NMR spectrum, where they usually absorb in the 50
to 80  range. For example, the carbon atoms next to oxygen in methyl propyl ether absorb at 58.5 and 74.8 .
Similarly, the methyl carbon in anisole absorbs at 54.8 .

Epoxy Resins and Adhesives

Few nonchemists know exactly what an epoxide is, but practically everyone has used an "epoxy glue" for
household repairs or an epoxy resin for a protective coating. Worldwide, approximately 14 billion dollars'
worth of epoxy resins and adhesives are used annually for a vast number of applications, including many in
the aerospace industry. Much of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for instance, is held together with epoxy-based
adhesives.
Epoxy resins and adhesives generally consist of two components that are mixed just prior to use. One
component is a liquid "prepolymer," and the second is a "curing agent" that reacts with the prepolymer and
causes it to solidify.
The most widely used epoxy resins and adhesives are based on a prepolymer made from bisphenol A and
epichlorohydrin. On treatment with base, bisphenol A is converted into its anion, which acts as a nucleophile
in an SN2 reaction with epichlorohydrin. Each epichlorohydrin molecule can react with two molecules of
bisphenol A, once by SN2 displacement of chloride ion and once by nucleophilic opening of the epoxide ring.
At the same time, each bisphenol A molecule can react with two epichlorohydrins, leading to a long polymer
chain. Each end of a prepolymer chain has an unreacted epoxy group, and each chain has numerous secondary
alcohol groups spaced regularly along its midsection.

Falls Kayak Race" by Watts/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
638 18 · Key Terms

When an epoxide is to be used, a basic curing agent such as a tertiary amine, R3N, is added to cause the
individual prepolymer chains to link together. This cross-linking of chains is simply a base-catalyzed, SN2
epoxide ring-opening of an -OH group in the middle of one chain with an epoxide group on the end of another
chain. The result of such cross-linking is formation of a vast, three-dimensional tangle that has enormous
strength and chemical resistance.

Summary

This chapter has finished the coverage of functional groups with C-O and C-S single bonds, focusing primarily
on ethers, epoxides, thiols, and sulfides. Ethers are compounds that have two organic groups bonded to the
same oxygen atom, ROR. The organic groups can be alkyl, vinylic, or aryl, and the oxygen atom can be in a ring
or in an open chain. Ethers are prepared by either Williamson ether synthesis, which involves SN2 reaction of
an alkoxide ion with a primary alkyl halide, or the alkoxymercuration reaction, which involves Markovnikov
addition of an alcohol to an alkene.

Ethers are inert to most reagents but react with strong acids to give cleavage products. Both HI and HBr are

often used. The cleavage reaction takes place by an SN2 mechanism at the less highly substituted site if only
primary and secondary alkyl groups are bonded to the ether oxygen, but by an SN1 or E1 mechanism if one of
the alkyl groups bonded to oxygen is tertiary.

Epoxides are cyclic ethers with a three-membered, oxygen-containing ring. Because of the strain in the ring,
epoxides undergo a cleavage reaction with both acids and bases. Acid-catalyzed ring-opening occurs with a
regiochemistry that depends on the structure of the epoxide. Cleavage of the C-O bond at the less highly
substituted site occurs if both epoxide carbons are primary or secondary, but cleavage of the C-O bond to
the more highly substituted site occurs if one of the epoxide carbons is tertiary. Base-catalyzed epoxide ring-
opening occurs by SN2 reaction of a nucleophile at the less hindered epoxide carbon.

Thiols, the sulfur analogs of alcohols, are usually prepared by SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with thiourea. Mild
oxidation of a thiol yields a disulfide, and mild reduction of a disulfide returns the thiol. Sulfides, the sulfur
analogs of ethers, are prepared by an SN2 reaction between a thiolate anion and a primary or secondary alkyl
halide. Sulfides are more nucleophilic than ethers and can be alkylated by reaction with a primary alkyl halide
to yield a sulfonium ion. Sulfides can also be oxidized to sulfoxides and to sulfones.

Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry

Carbonyl compounds are everywhere. Most biological molecules contain carbonyl groups, as do most
pharmaceutical agents and many of the synthetic chemicals that affect our everyday lives. Citric acid, found in
lemons and oranges; acetaminophen, the active ingredient in many over-the-counter headache remedies; and
Dacron, the polyester material used in clothing, all contain different kinds of carbonyl groups.

To a great extent, the chemistry of living organisms is the chemistry of carbonyl compounds. Thus, we'll

spend the next five chapters discussing the chemistry of the carbonyl group,  (pronounced car-bo-neel).

There are many different kinds of carbonyl compounds and many different reactions, but there are only a few

fundamental principles that tie the entire field together. The purpose of this brief preview is not to show details

of specific reactions but rather to provide a framework for learning carbonyl-group chemistry. Read through

this preview now, and return to it on occasion to remind yourself of the larger picture.

I Kinds of Carbonyl Compounds

TABLE 18.2 shows some of the many different kinds of carbonyl compounds. All contain an acyl group

(  ) bonded to another substituent. The R part of the acyl group can be practically any organic part/

structure, and the other substituent to which the acyl group is bonded might be a carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,

halogen, nitrogen, or sulfur.

It's useful to classify carbonyl compounds into two categories based on the kinds of chemistry they undergo. In
one category are aldehydes and ketones; in the other are carboxylic acids and their derivatives. The acyl group
in an aldehyde or ketone is bonded to an atom (H or C, respectively) that can't stabilize a negative charge and
therefore can't act as a leaving group in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The acyl group in a carboxylic acid
or its derivative, however, is bonded to an atom (oxygen, halogen, sulfur, nitrogen) that can stabilize a negative
charge and therefore can act as a leaving group in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.

II Nature of the Carbonyl Group

The carbon-oxygen double bond of a carbonyl group is similar in many respects to the carbon-carbon double
bond of an alkene. The carbonyl carbon atom is sp2-hybridized and forms three  bonds. The fourth valence
electron remains in a carbon p orbital and forms a  bond to oxygen by overlapping with an oxygen p orbital.

The oxygen atom also has two nonbonding pairs of electrons, which occupy its remaining two orbitals.

Like alkenes, carbonyl compounds are planar about the double bond and have bond angles of approximately
120°. FIGURE 18.8 shows the structure of acetaldehyde and indicates its bond lengths and angles. As you might
expect, the carbon-oxygen double bond is both shorter (122 pm versus 143 pm) and stronger [732 kJ/mol (175
kcal/mol) versus 385 kJ/mol (92 kcal/mol)] than a C-O single bond.

                                                                  FIGURE 18.8 Structure of acetaldehyde.

As indicated by the electrostatic potential map in FIGURE 18.8, the carbon-oxygen double bond is strongly
polarized because of the high electronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Thus, the carbonyl carbon atom
carries a partial positive charge, is an electrophilic (Lewis acidic) site, and reacts with nucleophiles. Conversely,
the carbonyl oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge, is a nucleophilic (Lewis basic) site, and reacts
with electrophiles. We'll see in the next five chapters that the majority of carbonyl-group reactions can be
rationalized by simple polarity arguments.

III General Reactions of Carbonyl Compounds

Both in the laboratory and in living organisms, most reactions of carbonyl compounds take place by one of four
general mechanisms: nucleophilic addition, nucleophilic acyl substitution, alpha substitution, and carbonyl
condensation. These mechanisms have many variations, just as alkene electrophilic addition reactions and SN2
reactions do, but the variations are much easier to learn when the fundamental features of the mechanisms are
made clear. Let's see what the four mechanisms are and what kinds of chemistry carbonyl compounds undergo.

Nucleophilic Addition Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones (Chapter 19)

The most common reaction of aldehydes and ketones is the nucleophilic addition reaction, in which a
nucleophile, :Nu-, adds to the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group. Because the nucleophile uses an
electron pair to form a new bond to carbon, two electrons from the carbon-oxygen double bond must move
toward the electronegative oxygen atom to give an alkoxide anion. The carbonyl carbon rehybridizes from sp2
to sp3 during the reaction, and the alkoxide ion product therefore has tetrahedral geometry.

Once formed, and depending on the nature of the nucleophile, the tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate can
undergo one of two further reactions, as shown in FIGURE 18.9. Often, the tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate
is simply protonated by water or acid to form an alcohol product. Alternatively, the tetrahedral intermediate
652 18 · Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry

can be protonated and expel the oxygen to form a new double bond between the carbonyl carbon and the
nucleophile. We'll study both processes in detail in Chapter 19.

FIGURE 18.9 The addition reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a nucleophile. Depending on the nucleophile, either an alcohol or a

compound with a  double bond is formed.

FORMATION OF AN ALCOHOL

The simplest reaction of a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is protonation to yield an alcohol. We've already
seen two examples of this kind of process during reduction of aldehydes and ketones with hydride reagents
such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4 (Section 17.4) and during Grignard reactions (Section 17.5). During a reduction,
the nucleophile that adds to the carbonyl group is a hydride ion, H:-, while during a Grignard reaction, the
nucleophile is a carbanion, R3C:-.

FORMATION OF

The second mode of nucleophilic addition, which often occurs with amine nucleophiles, involves elimination of

oxygen and formation of a        double bond. For example, aldehydes and ketones react with primary amines,

RNH2, to form imines,            . These reactions use the same kind of tetrahedral intermediate as that formed

during hydride reduction and Grignard reaction, but the initially formed alkoxide ion is not isolated. Instead, it

is protonated and then loses water to form an imine, as shown in FIGURE 18.10.

                      ketone.

Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives (Chapter 21)

The second fundamental reaction of carbonyl compounds, nucleophilic acyl substitution, is related to the
nucleophilic addition reaction just discussed but occurs only with carboxylic acid derivatives rather than with
aldehydes and ketones. When the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid derivative reacts with a nucleophile,
addition occurs in the usual way, but the initially formed tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is not isolated.
Because carboxylic acid derivatives have a leaving group bonded to the carbonyl-group carbon, the tetrahedral
intermediate can react further by expelling the leaving group and forming a new carbonyl compound:

The net effect of nucleophilic acyl substitution is the replacement of the leaving group by the entering
nucleophile. We'll see in Chapter 21, for instance, that acid chlorides are rapidly converted into esters by
treatment with alkoxide ions (FIGURE 18.11).

                      Nucleophilic acyl substitution of an acid chloride with an alkoxide ion yields an
                      ester.

Alpha-Substitution Reactions (Chapter 22)

The third major reaction of carbonyl compounds, alpha substitution, occurs at the position next to the carbonyl
group--the alpha () position. This reaction results in the substitution of an  hydrogen by an electrophile
through the formation of an intermediate enol or enolate ion:

For reasons that we'll explore in Chapter 22, the presence of a carbonyl group renders the hydrogens on the 
carbon acidic. Carbonyl compounds therefore react with strong base to yield enolate ions.

Because they're negatively charged, enolate ions act as nucleophiles and undergo many of the reactions we've
already studied. For example, enolates react with primary alkyl halides in the SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic
enolate ion displaces halide ion, and a new C-C bond forms:

The SN2 alkylation reaction between an enolate ion and an alkyl halide is a powerful method for making C-C
bonds, thereby building up larger molecules from smaller precursors. We'll study the alkylation of many kinds
of carbonyl compounds in Chapter 22.

Carbonyl Condensation Reactions (Chapter 23)

The fourth and last fundamental reaction of carbonyl groups, carbonyl condensation, takes place when two
carbonyl compounds react with each other. When acetaldehyde is treated with base, for instance, two molecules
combine to yield the hydroxy aldehyde product known as aldol (aldehyde + alcohol):

Although carbonyl condensation appears to be different from the three processes already discussed, it's
actually quite similar. A carbonyl condensation reaction is simply a combination of a nucleophilic addition step
and an -substitution step. The initially formed enolate ion of one acetaldehyde molecule acts as a nucleophile
and adds to the carbonyl group of another acetaldehyde molecule, as shown in FIGURE 18.12.

IV Summary

To a great extent, the chemistry of living organisms is the chemistry of carbonyl compounds. We have not
looked at the details of specific carbonyl reactions in this short preview but rather have laid the groundwork for
the next five chapters. All the carbonyl-group reactions we'll be studying in Chapters 19 through 23 fall into one
of the four fundamental categories discussed in this preview. Knowing where we'll be heading should help you
keep matters straight in understanding this most important of all functional groups.

660  19 · Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

     pathways, and in numerous industrial processes, so an understanding of their properties and reactions is
     essential. In this chapter, we'll look at some of their most important reactions.

     Aldehydes (RCHO) and ketones (R2CO) are among the most widely occurring of all compounds. In nature,
     many substances required by living organisms are aldehydes or ketones. The aldehyde pyridoxal phosphate,
     for instance, is a coenzyme involved in a large number of metabolic reactions; the ketone hydrocortisone is a
     steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal glands to regulate fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism.

     In the chemical industry, simple aldehydes and ketones are produced in large quantities for use as solvents and

     as starting materials to prepare a host of other compounds. For example, more than 50 million tons per year

     of formaldehyde,  , is produced worldwide for use in building insulation materials and in the adhesive

     resins that bind particle board and plywood. Acetone,        , is widely used as an industrial solvent,

     with approximately 8 million tons per year produced worldwide. Formaldehyde is synthesized industrially

     by catalytic oxidation of methanol, and one method of acetone preparation involves oxidation of 2-propanol

     produced by hydration of propylene.

     19.1 Naming Aldehydes and Ketones

     Aldehydes are named by replacing the terminal -e of the corresponding alkane name with -al. The parent chain
     must contain the -CHO group, and the -CHO carbon is numbered as carbon 1. Note in the following examples
     that the longest chain in 2-ethyl-4-methylpentanal is actually a hexane, but this chain does not include the
     -CHO group and thus is not the parent.

     For cyclic aldehydes in which the -CHO group is directly attached to a ring, the ring name followed by
     carbaldehyde is used.

A few simple and well-known aldehydes have common names that are recognized by IUPAC. Several that you
might encounter are listed in TABLE 19.1.

TABLE 19.1 Common Names of Some Simple Aldehydes

Formula                              Common name Systematic name

HCHO                                 Formaldehyde Methanal

CH3CHO                               Acetaldehyde  Ethanal
                                     Acrolein      Propenal

                                     Crotonaldehyde 2-Butenal

                                     Benzaldehyde Benzenecarbaldehyde

Ketones are named by replacing the terminal -e of the corresponding alkane name with -one. The parent chain
is the longest one that includes the ketone group, and the numbering begins at the end nearer the carbonyl
carbon. As with alkenes (Section 7.3) and alcohols (Section 17.1), the locant is placed before the parent name
using older rules but before the suffix with the newer IUPAC guidelines. For example:

A few ketones are allowed by IUPAC to retain their common names.

When it's necessary to refer to the  group as a substituent, the name acyl (a-sil) group is used and the

name ending -yl is attached. Thus, -COCH3 is an acetyl group, -CHO is a formyl group, -COAr is an aroyl group,

and -COC6H5 is a benzoyl group.

If other functional groups are present and the double-bonded oxygen is considered a substituent on a parent
chain, the prefix oxo- is used. For example:

     19.2 Preparing Aldehydes and Ketones

     Preparing Aldehydes

     Perhaps the best method of aldehyde synthesis is by oxidation of a primary alcohol, as we saw in Section 17.7.
     The reaction is usually carried out using the Dess-Martin periodinane reagent in dichloromethane solvent at
     room temperature:

     Another method of aldehyde synthesis is one that we'll mention here just briefly and then return to in Section
     21.6. Certain carboxylic acid derivatives can be partially reduced to yield aldehydes. The partial reduction of
     an ester by diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAH, or DIBAL-H), for instance, is an important laboratory-scale
     method of aldehyde synthesis, and mechanistically related processes also occur in biological pathways. The
     reaction is normally carried out at -78 °C (dry-ice temperature) in toluene solution.

oxidized by a variety of reagents to give ketones (Section 17.7). The choice of oxidant depends on such factors
as reaction scale, cost, and acid or base sensitivity of the alcohol. The Dess-Martin periodinane is a common
choice although chromic acid (H2CrO4) was frequently used in older work.

Other methods include the ozonolysis of alkenes in which one of the unsaturated carbon atoms is disubstituted
(Section 8.8) and Friedel-Crafts acylation of an aromatic ring with an acid chloride in the presence of AlCl3
catalyst (Section 16.3).

In addition to those methods already discussed, ketones can also be prepared from certain carboxylic acid
derivatives, just as aldehydes can. Among the most useful reactions of this sort is that between an acid chloride
and a lithium diorganocopper reagent, as we saw in Section 10.7. We'll discuss this reaction in more detail in
Section 21.4.

19.3 Oxidation of Aldehydes and Ketones

Aldehydes are easily oxidized to yield carboxylic acids, but ketones are generally inert toward oxidation. The
difference is a consequence of structure: aldehydes have a -CHO proton that can be abstracted during
oxidation, but ketones do not.

Many oxidizing agents, including alkaline KMnO4 and hot HNO3, convert aldehydes into carboxylic acids. The
oxidation occurs rapidly at room temperature and generally works well.
664  19 · Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

     Aldehyde oxidations occur through intermediate 1,1-diols, or hydrates, which are formed by a reversible
     nucleophilic addition of water to the carbonyl group. Even though it's formed to only a small extent at
     equilibrium, the hydrate reacts like any typical primary or secondary alcohol and is oxidized to a carbonyl
     compound (Section 17.7).

     Ketones are inert to most oxidizing agents but undergo a slow cleavage reaction of the C-C bond next to
     the carbonyl group when treated with hot alkaline KMnO4. The reaction is not often used, however, and is
     mentioned here only for completeness.

     19.4 Nucleophilic Addition Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones

     As we saw in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, the most general reaction of aldehydes and ketones is the
     nucleophilic addition reaction. As shown in FIGURE 19.2, a nucleophile, :Nu-, approaches the carbonyl group

     from an angle of about 105° opposite the carbonyl oxygen and forms a bond to the electrophilic C-O carbon
     atom. At the same time, rehybridization of the carbonyl carbon from sp2 to sp3 occurs, an electron pair from

     the  bond moves toward the electronegative oxygen atom, and a tetrahedral alkoxide ion intermediate is

     produced. Protonation of the alkoxide by addition of acid then gives an alcohol.

                the sp2 orbitals, the carbonyl carbon rehybridizes from sp2 to sp3, and an alkoxide
                ion is formed. Protonation by addition of acid then gives an alcohol.

The nucleophile can be either negatively charged (:Nu-) or neutral (:Nu). If it's neutral, however, it usually
carries a hydrogen atom that can subsequently be eliminated, :Nu-H. For example:

Nucleophilic additions to aldehydes and ketones have two general variations, as shown in FIGURE 19.3. In one

variation, the tetrahedral intermediate is protonated by water or acid to give an alcohol as the final product.
In the second variation, the carbonyl oxygen atom is protonated and then eliminated as HO- or H2O to give a

product with a  double bond.

     FIGURE 19.3 Two general reaction pathways following addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone. The top pathway leads to an

     alcohol product; the bottom pathway leads to a product with a   double bond.

     Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions for both steric and

     electronic reasons. Sterically, the presence of only one large substituent bonded to the  carbon in an

     aldehyde versus two large substituents in a ketone means that a nucleophile is able to approach an aldehyde

     more readily. Thus, the transition state leading to the tetrahedral intermediate is less crowded and lower in

     energy for an aldehyde than for a ketone (FIGURE 19.4).

     FIGURE 19.4 Steric hindrance in nucleophilic addition reactions. (a) Nucleophilic addition to an aldehyde is sterically less hindered

     because only one relatively large substituent is attached to the carbonyl-group carbon. (b) A ketone, however, has two large substituents and

     is more hindered. The approach of the nucleophile is along the

     Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because of the greater polarization of aldehyde
     carbonyl groups. To see this polarity difference, recall the stability order of carbocations (Section 7.9). A
     primary carbocation is higher in energy and thus more reactive than a secondary carbocation since it has only
     one alkyl group inductively stabilizing the positive charge rather than two. In the same way, an aldehyde has
     only one alkyl group inductively stabilizing the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon rather than two,
     and is a bit more electrophilic, and, therefore, more reactive than a ketone.

     One further comparison: aromatic aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, are less reactive in nucleophilic addition
     reactions than aliphatic aldehydes because the electron-donating resonance effect of the aromatic ring makes
     the carbonyl group less electrophilic. Comparing electrostatic potential maps of formaldehyde and
     benzaldehyde, for example, shows that the carbonyl carbon atom is less positive (less blue) in the aromatic

19.5 Nucleophilic Addition of H2O: Hydration

Aldehydes and ketones react with water to yield 1,1-diols, or geminal (gem) diols. The hydration reaction is
reversible, and a gem diol can eliminate water to regenerate an aldehyde or ketone.

The position of the equilibrium between a gem diol and an aldehyde or ketone depends on the structure of the
carbonyl compound. Equilibrium generally favors the carbonyl compound for steric reasons, but the gem diol
is favored for a few simple aldehydes. For example, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde consists of 99.9% gem
diol and 0.1% aldehyde at equilibrium, whereas an aqueous solution of acetone consists of only about 0.1% gem
diol and 99.9% ketone.

The hydrate is also favored for -keto carboxylic acids, which have adjacent positively charged carbons that
destabilize the keto form and favor the hydrate. Such compounds occur commonly in many biological pathways.
Pyruvic acid, which is 60% hydrate at equilibrium, and -ketoglutaric acid, which is 50% hydrate, are examples.
668  19 · Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

     The nucleophilic addition of water to an aldehyde or ketone is slow under neutral conditions but is catalyzed
     by both base and acid. Under basic conditions (FIGURE 19.5a), the nucleophile is negatively charged (OH-) and

     uses a pair of its electrons to form a bond to the electrophilic carbon atom of the  group. At the same time,
                                                                                           bond are pushed onto
     the  carbon atom rehybridizes from sp2 to sp3 and two electrons from the

     the oxygen atom, giving an alkoxide ion. Protonation of the alkoxide ion by water then yields a neutral addition
     product plus regenerated OH-.

     Under acidic conditions (FIGURE 19.5b), the carbonyl oxygen atom is first protonated by H3O+ to make the

     carbonyl group more strongly electrophilic. A neutral nucleophile, H2O, then uses a pair of electrons to bond

     to the carbon atom of the        group, and two electrons from the   bond move onto the oxygen atom.

     The positive charge on oxygen is thereby neutralized, while the nucleophile gains a positive charge. Finally,
     deprotonation by water gives the neutral addition product and regenerates the H3O+ catalyst.

     Note the key difference between the base-catalyzed and acid-catalyzed reactions. The base-catalyzed reaction
     takes place rapidly because water is converted into hydroxide ion, a much better nucleophile. The acid-
     catalyzed reaction takes place rapidly because the carbonyl compound is converted by protonation into a much
     better electrophile.

FIGURE 19.5 MECHANISM

The mechanism for a nucleophilic addition reaction of aldehydes and ketones under both basic and acidic
conditions. (a) Under basic conditions, a negatively charged nucleophile adds to the carbonyl group to give an
alkoxide ion intermediate, which is subsequently protonated. (b) Under acidic conditions, protonation of the
carbonyl group occurs first, followed by addition of a neutral nucleophile and subsequent deprotonation.

The hydration reaction just described is typical of what happens when an aldehyde or ketone is treated with a
nucleophile of the type H-Y, where the Y atom is electronegative and can stabilize a negative charge (oxygen,
halogen, or sulfur, for instance). In such reactions, the nucleophilic addition is reversible, with the equilibrium
generally favoring the carbonyl reactant rather than the tetrahedral addition product. In other words, treatment
of an aldehyde or ketone with CH3OH, H2O, HCl, HBr, or H2SO4 does not normally lead to a stable alcohol
addition product.

     19.6 Nucleophilic Addition of HCN: Cyanohydrin Formation

     Aldehydes and unhindered ketones undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction with HCN to yield cyanohydrins,
                          . Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation

     is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small
     amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, CN-. Addition of CN- takes place by a
     typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give
     cyanohydrin product plus regenerated CN-.

     Cyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic
     acid (H-Y) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as H2O, HBr, HCl, and H2SO4
     don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN,
     however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.

     Cyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product.

     For example, a nitrile (  ) can be reduced with LiAlH4 to yield a primary amine (RCH2NH2) and can be

     hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for

     transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.

     Addition of Hydride Reagents: Reduction

     We saw in Section 17.4 that the most common method for preparing alcohols, both in the laboratory and in
     living organisms, is by the reduction of carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes are reduced with sodium borohydride
     (NaBH4) to give primary alcohols, and ketones are reduced similarly to give secondary alcohols.

Carbonyl reduction occurs by a typical nucleophilic addition mechanism under basic conditions, as shown
earlier in FIGURE 19.5a. Although the details of carbonyl-group reductions are complex, LiAlH4 and NaBH4
act as if they were donors of hydride ion nucleophile, :H-, and the initially formed alkoxide ion intermediate is
then protonated by addition of aqueous acid. The reaction is effectively irreversible because the reverse process
would require expulsion of a very poor leaving group.

                      FIGURE 19.6 MECHANISM
                      Mechanism of the Grignard reaction. Complexation of the carbonyl oxygen with
                      the Lewis acid Mg2+ and subsequent nucleophilic addition of a carbanion to an
                      aldehyde or ketone is followed by protonation of the alkoxide intermediate to yield
                      an alcohol.

Addition of Grignard Reagents, RMgX

Just as aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition with hydride ion to give alcohols, they undergo a
similar addition with Grignard reagent nucleophiles, R:- +MgX. Aldehydes give secondary alcohols on reaction
with Grignard reagents in ether solution, and ketones give tertiary alcohols.
672  19 · Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

     As shown in FIGURE 19.6, a Grignard reaction begins with an acid-base complexation of Mg2+ to the carbonyl
     oxygen atom of the aldehyde or ketone, thereby making the carbonyl group a better electrophile. Nucleophilic
     addition of R:- then produces a tetrahedral magnesium alkoxide intermediate, and protonation by addition of
     water or dilute aqueous acid in a separate step yields the neutral alcohol. Like reduction, Grignard additions are
     effectively irreversible because a carbanion is too poor a leaving group to be expelled in a reversal step.

     19.8 Nucleophilic Addition of Amines: Imine and Enamine Formation

     Primary amines, RNH2, add to aldehydes and ketones to yield imines,  . Secondary amines, R2NH, add

     similarly to yield enamines,         (ene + amine = unsaturated amine).

     Imines are particularly common as intermediates in biological pathways, where they are often called Schiff
     bases. The amino acid alanine, for instance, is metabolized in the body by reaction with the aldehyde pyridoxal
     phosphate (PLP), a derivative of vitamin B6, to yield a Schiff base that is further degraded.

     Imine formation and enamine formation seem different because one leads to a product with a  bond and

     the other leads to a product with a  bond. Actually, though, the reactions are quite similar. Both are typical

     examples of nucleophilic addition reactions in which water is eliminated from the initially formed tetrahedral

     intermediate and a new           double bond is formed.

     Imines are formed in a reversible, acid-catalyzed process (FIGURE 19.7) that begins with nucleophilic addition

     of the primary amine to the carbonyl group, followed by transfer of a proton from nitrogen to oxygen to yield

     a neutral amino alcohol, or carbinolamine. Protonation of the carbinolamine oxygen by an acid catalyst then
     converts the -OH into a better leaving group (-OH2+), and E1-like loss of water produces an iminium ion. Loss
     of a proton from nitrogen gives the final product and regenerates the acid catalyst.

FIGURE 19.7 MECHANISM

Imine formation with such reagents as hydroxylamine and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is sometimes useful
because the products of these reactions--oximes and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones (2,4-DNPs),
respectively--are often crystalline and easy to handle. Such crystalline derivatives are occasionally prepared as
a means of purifying and characterizing liquid ketones or aldehydes.
674  19 · Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

     Reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a secondary amine, R2NH, rather than a primary amine yields an
     enamine. As shown in FIGURE 19.8, the process is identical to imine formation up to the iminium ion stage, but

     at this point there is no proton on nitrogen that can be lost to form a neutral imine product. Instead, a proton is
     lost from the neighboring carbon (the  carbon), yielding an enamine.

FIGURE 19.8 MECHANISM

Mechanism for enamine formation by reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a
secondary amine, R2NH. The iminium ion intermediate formed in step 3 has no
hydrogen attached to N and so must lose H+ from the carbon two atoms away.

Imine and enamine formation are slow at both high pH and low pH but reach a maximum rate at a weakly acidic
pH around 4 to 5. For example, the profile of pH versus rate shown in FIGURE 19.9 for the reaction between
acetone and hydroxylamine, NH2OH, indicates that the maximum reaction rate occurs at pH 4.5.

We can explain the observed pH dependence of imine formation by looking at the individual steps in the
mechanism. As indicated in FIGURE 19.8, an acid catalyst is required in step 3 to protonate the intermediate
carbinolamine, thereby converting the -OH into a better leaving group. Thus, reaction will be slow if not enough
acid is present (that is, at high pH). On the other hand, if too much acid is present (low pH), the basic amine
nucleophile is completely protonated, so the initial nucleophilic addition step can't occur.

     Evidently, a pH of 4.5 represents a compromise between the need for some acid to catalyze the rate-limiting
     dehydration step but not too much acid so as to avoid complete protonation of the amine. Each nucleophilic
     addition reaction has its own requirements, and conditions must be optimized to obtain maximum reaction
     rates.

19.9 Nucleophilic Addition of Hydrazine: The Wolff-Kishner Reaction

A useful variant of the imine-forming reaction just discussed involves the treatment of an aldehyde or ketone

with hydrazine, H2N-NH2, in the presence of KOH. Called the Wolff-Kishner reaction, the process is a useful

and general method for converting an aldehyde or ketone into an alkane,  .

As shown in FIGURE 19.10, the Wolff-Kishner reaction involves formation of a hydrazone intermediate,
                    , followed by base-catalyzed double-bond migration, loss of N2 gas to give a carbanion, and

protonation to give the alkane product. The double-bond migration takes place when a base removes one of the
weakly acidic NH protons in step 2 to generate a hydrazone anion, which has an allylic resonance structure that
places the double bond between nitrogens and the negative charge on carbon. Reprotonation then occurs on
carbon to generate the double-bond rearrangement product. The next step--loss of nitrogen and formation of
an alkyl anion--is driven by the large thermodynamic stability of the N2 molecule.

19.10 Nucleophilic Addition of Alcohols: Acetal Formation

Aldehydes and ketones react reversibly with 2 equivalents of an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to
yield acetals, R2C(OR)2, which are often called ketals if derived from a ketone. Cyclohexanone, for instance,
reacts with methanol in the presence of HCl to give the corresponding dimethyl acetal.

Acetal formation is similar to the hydration reaction discussed in Section 19.5. Like water, alcohols are weak
nucleophiles that add to aldehydes and ketones slowly under neutral conditions. Under acidic conditions,
however, the reactivity of the carbonyl group is increased by protonation, so addition of an alcohol occurs
rapidly.

As shown in FIGURE 19.11, nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the carbonyl group initially yields a hydroxy

ether called a hemiacetal, analogous to the gem diol formed by addition of water. Hemiacetals are formed

reversibly, with equilibrium normally favoring the carbonyl compound. In the presence of acid, however, a

further reaction occurs. Protonation of the -OH group, followed by an E1-like loss of water, leads to an oxonium

ion,  , which undergoes a second nucleophilic addition of alcohol to yield the protonated acetal. Loss

of a proton completes the reaction.

forward reaction is favored by conditions that remove water from the medium and thus drive the equilibrium
to the right. In practice, this is often done by distilling off water as it forms. The reverse reaction is favored by
treating the acetal with a large excess of aqueous acid to drive the equilibrium to the left.

Acetals are useful because they can act as protecting groups for aldehydes and ketones in the same way that
trimethylsilyl ethers act as protecting groups for alcohols (Section 17.8). As we saw previously, it sometimes
happens that one functional group interferes with intended chemistry elsewhere in a complex molecule. For
example, if we wanted to reduce only the ester group of ethyl 4-oxopentanoate, the ketone would interfere.
Treatment of the starting keto ester with LiAlH4 would reduce both the keto group and the ester group to give a
diol product.

By protecting the keto group as an acetal, however, the problem can be circumvented. Like other ethers, acetals
are unreactive to bases, hydride reducing agents, Grignard reagents, and catalytic hydrogenation conditions,
but they are cleaved by acid. Thus, we can accomplish the selective reduction of the ester group in ethyl
4-oxopentanoate by first converting the keto group to an acetal, then reducing the ester with LiAlH4, and then
removing the acetal by treatment with aqueous acid. (In practice, it's often convenient to use 1 equivalent of
a diol such as ethylene glycol as the alcohol to form a cyclic acetal. The mechanism of cyclic acetal formation
using 1 equivalent of ethylene glycol is exactly the same as that using 2 equivalents of methanol or other
monoalcohols.)

Acetal and hemiacetal groups are particularly common in carbohydrate chemistry. Glucose, for instance, is a
polyhydroxy aldehyde that undergoes an internal nucleophilic addition reaction and exists primarily as a cyclic
hemiacetal.

     19.11 Nucleophilic Addition of Phosphorus Ylides: The Wittig Reaction

     Aldehydes and ketones are converted into alkenes by means of a nucleophilic addition called the Wittig
     reaction, after the German chemist Georg Wittig who won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The reaction has
     no direct biological counterpart but is important both because of its wide use in drug manufacture and because
     of its mechanistic similarity to reactions of the coenzyme thiamin diphosphate, which we'll see in Section 29.6.

     In the Wittig reaction, a triphenylphosphorus ylide,         also called a phosphorane and sometimes

     written in the resonance form  , adds to an aldehyde or ketone to yield a four-membered cyclic

     intermediate called an oxaphosphetane. The oxaphosphetane is not isolated, but instead spontaneously

     decomposes to give an alkene plus triphenylphosphine oxide,              . In effect, the oxygen atom of the

     aldehyde or ketone and the R2C= bonded to phosphorus exchange places. (An ylide--pronounced ill-id--is a

     neutral, dipolar compound with adjacent positive and negative charges.)

     The initial addition takes place by different pathways depending on the structure of the reactants and the exact
     experimental conditions. One pathway involves a one-step cycloaddition process analogous to the Diels-Alder
     cycloaddition reaction (Section 14.4). The other pathway involves a nucleophilic addition reaction to give a
     dipolar intermediate called a betaine (bay-ta-een), which undergoes ring closure.

The phosphorus ylides necessary for Wittig reaction are easily prepared by SN2 reaction of primary (and some
secondary) alkyl halides with triphenylphosphine, (Ph)3P, followed by treatment with base. Triphenylphosphine
is a good nucleophile in SN2 reactions, and yields of the resultant alkyltriphenylphosphonium salts are high.
Because of the positive charge on phosphorus, the hydrogen on the neighboring carbon is weakly acidic and can

be removed by a strong base such as butyllithium (BuLi) to generate the neutral ylide. For example:

The Wittig reaction is extremely general, and a great many monosubstituted, disubstituted, and trisubstituted
alkenes can be prepared from the appropriate combination of phosphorane and aldehyde or ketone.
Tetrasubstituted alkenes, however, can't be prepared this way because of steric hindrance.

The real value of the Wittig reaction is that it yields a pure alkene of predictable structure. The  bond in the

product is always exactly where the  group was in the reactant, and no alkene isomers (except E,Z isomers)

are formed. For example, Wittig reaction of cyclohexanone with methylenetriphenylphosphorane yields only

the single alkene product methylenecyclohexane. By contrast, addition of methylmagnesium bromide to

cyclohexanone, followed by dehydration with POCl3, yields a roughly 9 : 1 mixture of two alkenes.

Wittig reactions are used commercially in the synthesis of numerous pharmaceutical products. For example,
the German chemical company BASF prepares vitamin A by using a Wittig reaction between a 15-carbon ylide
and a 5-carbon aldehyde.

19.12 Biological Reductions

As a general rule, nucleophilic addition reactions are characteristic only of aldehydes and ketones, not of
carboxylic acid derivatives. The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview
of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a
nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl
substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or
ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One
exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.

FIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent Y = -Br, -Cl, -OR, -NR2 that can be expelled as a
leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition. Aldehydes and ketones have no such leaving group and
thus do not usually undergo this reaction.

The Cannizzaro reaction takes place by nucleophilic addition of OH- to an aldehyde to give a tetrahedral
intermediate, which expels hydride ion as a leaving group and is thereby oxidized. A second aldehyde molecule
accepts the hydride ion in another nucleophilic addition step and is thereby reduced. Benzaldehyde, for
instance, yields benzyl alcohol plus benzoic acid when heated with aqueous NaOH.

The Cannizzaro reaction is rarely used today but is interesting mechanistically because it is a simple laboratory

analogy for the primary biological pathway by which carbonyl reductions occur in living organisms. In nature,
as we saw in Section 17.4, one of the most important reducing agents is NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide. NADH donates H- to aldehydes and ketones, thereby reducing them, in much the same way that

the tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate in a Cannizzaro reaction does. The electron lone pair on a nitrogen atom
of NADH expels H- as leaving group, which adds to a carbonyl group in another molecule (FIGURE 19.13). As
an example, pyruvate is converted during intense muscle activity to (S)-lactate, a reaction catalyzed by lactate
dehydrogenase.

     19.13 Conjugate Nucleophilic Addition to ,Unsaturated Aldehydes and
     Ketones

     All the reactions we've been discussing to this point have involved the addition of a nucleophile directly to the

     carbonyl group, a so-called 1,2-addition. Closely related to this direct addition is the conjugate addition, or

     1,4-addition, of a nucleophile to the  bond of an ,-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone. (The carbon atom

     next to a carbonyl group is often called the  carbon, the next carbon is the  carbon, and so on. Thus, an

     ,-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone has a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group.) The initial product

     of conjugate addition is a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, which typically undergoes protonation on the 

     carbon to give a saturated aldehyde or ketone product (FIGURE 19.14).

FIGURE 19.14 A comparison of direct (1,2) and conjugate (1,4) nucleophilic addition reactions. In conjugate addition, a nucleophile adds
to the  carbon of an ,-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone and protonation occurs on the  carbon.

The conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an ,-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone is caused by the same
electronic factors that are responsible for direct addition. The electronegative oxygen atom of the
,-unsaturated carbonyl compound withdraws electrons from the  carbon, thereby making it electron-poor
and more electrophilic than a typical alkene carbon.

As noted, conjugate addition of a nucleophile to the  carbon of an ,-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone leads to
an enolate ion intermediate, which is protonated on the  carbon to give the saturated product (FIGURE 19.14).

The net effect is addition of the nucleophile to the  bond, with the carbonyl group itself unchanged. In fact,

of course, the carbonyl group is crucial to the success of the reaction. Without the carbonyl group, the  bond

would not be activated for addition, and no reaction would occur.

Conjugate Addition of Amines

Both primary and secondary amines add to ,-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones to yield -amino aldehydes
and ketones rather than the alternative imines. Under typical reaction conditions, both modes of addition occur
688  19 · Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions

     rapidly. But because the reactions are reversible, they generally proceed with thermodynamic control rather
     than kinetic control (Section 14.3), so the more stable conjugate addition product is often obtained with the
     complete exclusion of the less stable direct addition product.

     Conjugate Addition of Water

     Water can add reversibly to ,-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones to yield -hydroxy aldehydes and ketones,
     although the position of the equilibrium generally favors unsaturated reactant rather than saturated adduct.
     Related additions to ,-unsaturated carboxylic acids occur in numerous biological pathways, such as the citric
     acid cycle of food metabolism in which cis-aconitate is converted into isocitrate by conjugate addition of water
     to a double bond.

     Conjugate Addition of Alkyl Groups: Organocopper Reactions

     The conjugate addition of an alkyl or other organic group to an ,-unsaturated ketone (but not aldehyde) is one
     of the more useful 1,4-addition reactions, just as direct addition of a Grignard reagent is one of the more useful
     1,2-additions.

     Conjugate addition of an organic group is carried out by treating the ,-unsaturated ketone with a lithium
     diorganocopper reagent, R2CuLi. As we saw in Section 10.7, lithium diorganocopper (Gilman) reagents are
     prepared by reaction between 1 equivalent of copper(I) iodide and 2 equivalents of an organolithium regent,
     RLi. The organolithium reagent, in turn, is formed by reaction of lithium metal with an organohalide in the same
     way that a Grignard reagent is prepared by reaction of magnesium metal with an organohalide.

Primary, secondary, and even tertiary alkyl groups undergo the conjugate addition reaction, as do aryl and
alkenyl groups. Alkynyl groups, however, react poorly in the conjugate addition process. Diorganocopper
reagents are unique in their ability to give conjugate addition products. Other organometallic reagents, such
as Grignard reagents and organolithiums, normally result in direct carbonyl addition on reaction with
,-unsaturated ketones.

The mechanism of this reaction is thought to involve conjugate nucleophilic addition of the diorganocopper
anion, R2Cu-, to the unsaturated ketone to give a copper-containing intermediate. Transfer of an R group from
copper to carbon, followed by elimination of a neutral organocopper species, RCu, gives the final product.

     Infrared Spectroscopy

     Aldehydes and ketones show a strong       bond absorption in the IR region from 1660 to 1770 cm-1, as the

     spectra of benzaldehyde and cyclohexanone demonstrate (FIGURE 19.15). In addition, aldehydes show two
     characteristic C-H absorptions between 2700-2760 and 2800-2860 cm-1. These absorbances are important

     for distinguishing between aldehydes and ketones. The higher-frequency absorbance is sometimes obscured in

     cases where the compound has numerous saturated C-H groups, but the lower-frequency peak is almost always

     visible.

The exact position of the  absorption is diagnostic of the nature of the carbonyl group. As the data in TABLE

19.2 indicate, saturated aldehydes usually show carbonyl absorptions near 1730 cm-1 in the IR spectrum, but

conjugation of the aldehyde to an aromatic ring or a double bond lowers the absorption by 25 cm-1 to near

1705 cm-1. Saturated aliphatic ketones and cyclohexanones both absorb near 1715 cm-1, and conjugation with

a double bond or an aromatic ring again lowers the absorption by 30 cm-1 to 1685-1690 cm-1. Angle strain

in the carbonyl group, caused by reducing the ring size of cyclic ketones to four or five, raises the absorption

position. Cyclohexanone has its  stretch absorbance at 1715 cm-1 while cyclopentanone's carbonyl stretch

is at 1750 cm-1 and cyclobutanone's is at 1785 cm-1.

     The values given in TABLE 19.2 are remarkably constant from one aldehyde or ketone to another. As a result, IR
     spectroscopy is a powerful tool for identifying the kind of a carbonyl group in a molecule of unknown structure.
     An unknown that shows an IR absorption at 1730 cm-1 is almost certainly an aldehyde rather than a ketone; an
     unknown that shows an IR absorption at 1750 cm-1 is almost certainly a cyclopentanone, and so on.

     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     Aldehyde protons (RCHO) absorb near 10  in the 1H NMR spectrum and are very distinctive because no
     other absorptions occur in this region. The aldehyde proton shows spin-spin coupling with protons on the
     neighboring carbon, with coupling constant J  3 Hz. Acetaldehyde, for example, shows a quartet at 9.79  for
     the aldehyde proton, indicating that there are three protons neighboring the -CHO group (FIGURE 19.16).

        FIGURE 19.16 1H NMR spectrum of acetaldehyde. The absorption of the aldehyde proton appears at 9.79  and is split into a quartet.

     Hydrogens on the carbon next to a carbonyl group are slightly deshielded and usually absorb near 2.0 to 2.3 .
     The acetaldehyde methyl group in FIGURE 19.16, for instance, absorbs at 2.20 . Methyl ketones are particularly
     distinctive because they always show a sharp three-proton singlet near 2.1 .
     The carbonyl-group carbon atoms of aldehydes and ketones have characteristic 13C NMR resonances in the
     range 190 to 215 . Since no other kinds of carbons absorb in this range, the presence of an NMR absorption
     near 200  is clear evidence for a carbonyl group. Saturated aldehyde or ketone carbons usually absorb in the
     region from 200 to 215 , while aromatic and ,-unsaturated carbonyl carbons absorb in the 190 to 200 
     region.

     Mass Spectrometry

     As discussed in Section 12.3, aliphatic aldehydes and ketones that have hydrogens on their gamma () carbon
     atoms undergo a characteristic mass spectral cleavage called the McLafferty rearrangement. A hydrogen atom
     is transferred from the  carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, the bond between the  and  carbons is broken, and a
     neutral alkene fragment is produced. The charge remains with the oxygen-containing fragment.

In addition to fragmentation by the McLafferty rearrangement, aldehydes and ketones also undergo cleavage of
the bond between the carbonyl group and the  carbon, called an  cleavage. Alpha cleavage yields a neutral
radical and a resonance-stabilized acyl cation.

Fragment ions from both McLafferty rearrangement and  cleavage are visible in the mass spectrum of
5-methyl-2-hexanone shown in FIGURE 19.17. McLafferty rearrangement with loss of 2-methylpropene yields
a fragment with m/z = 58. Alpha cleavage occurs primarily at the more substituted side of the carbonyl group,
leading to a [CH3CO]+ fragment with m/z = 43.

FIGURE 19.17 Mass spectrum and the related reactions of 5-methyl-2-hexanone. The peak at m/z = 58 is due to McLafferty
rearrangement. The abundant peak at m/z = 43 is due to  cleavage at the more highly substituted side of the carbonyl group. Note that the
peak due to the molecular ion is very small.

Enantioselective Synthesis

Whenever a chiral product is formed by reaction between achiral reagents, the product is racemic; that is,
both enantiomers of the product are formed in equal amounts. The epoxidation reaction of geraniol with
m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, for instance, gives a racemic mixture of (2S,3S) and (2R,3R) epoxides.

Unfortunately, it's usually the case that only one enantiomer of a given drug or other important substance
has the desired biological properties. The other enantiomer might be inactive or even dangerous. Thus, much
work is currently being done on developing enantioselective methods of synthesis, which yield only one of
the two possible enantiomers. So important has enantioselective synthesis become that the 2001 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry was awarded to three pioneers in the field: William S. Knowles of the Monsanto Co., K. Barry
Sharpless of the Scripps Research Institute, and Ryoji Noyori of Nagoya University.
Several approaches to enantioselective synthesis have been developed, but the most efficient are those that use
chiral catalysts to temporarily hold a substrate molecule in an unsymmetrical environment--the same strategy
that nature uses when catalyzing reactions with chiral enzymes. While in that unsymmetrical environment, the
substrate may be more open to reaction on one side than on another, leading to an excess of one enantiomeric
product over another. As an analogy, think about picking up a coffee mug in your right hand to take a drink. The
mug by itself is achiral, but as soon as you pick it up by the handle, it becomes chiral. One side of the mug now
faces toward you so you can drink from it, but the other side faces away. The two sides are different, with one
side much more accessible to you than the other.

(CH3)3C-OOH, in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide and diethyl tartrate (DET) as a chiral auxiliary
reagent. When (R,R) tartrate is used, geraniol is converted into its 2S,3S epoxide with 98% selectivity, whereas
the use of (S,S) tartrate gives the 2R,3R epoxide enantiomer. We say that the major product in each case is
formed with an enantiomeric excess of 96%, meaning that 4% of the product is racemic (2% 2S,3S plus 2%
2R,3R) and an extra 96% of a single enantiomer is formed. The mechanistic details by which the chiral catalyst
works are a bit complex, although it appears that a chiral complex of two tartrate molecules with one titanium
is involved.

Summary

Aldehydes and ketones are among the most important of all functional groups, both in the chemical industry
and in biological pathways. In this chapter, we've looked at some of their typical reactions. Aldehydes are
normally prepared in the laboratory by oxidation of primary alcohols or by partial reduction of esters. Ketones
are similarly prepared by oxidation of secondary alcohols.

The nucleophilic addition reaction is the most common general reaction type for aldehydes and ketones. Many
different kinds of products can be prepared by nucleophilic additions. Aldehydes and ketones are reduced
by NaBH4 or LiAlH4 to yield primary and secondary alcohols, respectively. Addition of Grignard reagents to
aldehydes and ketones also gives alcohols (secondary and tertiary, respectively), and addition of HCN yields
cyanohydrins. Primary amines add to carbonyl compounds yielding imines, or Schiff bases, and secondary

amines yield enamines. Reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with hydrazine and base gives an alkane (the
Wolff-Kishner reaction). Alcohols add to carbonyl groups to yield acetals, which are valuable as protecting
groups. Phosphorus ylides add to aldehydes and ketones in the Wittig reaction to give alkenes.
,-Unsaturated aldehydes and ketones often react with nucleophiles to give the product of conjugate addition,
or 1,4-addition. Particularly useful are the conjugate addition of an amine and the conjugate addition of an
organic group by reaction with a diorganocopper reagent.
IR spectroscopy is helpful for identifying aldehydes and ketones. Carbonyl groups absorb in the IR range 1660 to
1770 cm-1, with the exact position highly diagnostic of the kind of carbonyl group present in the molecule. 13C
NMR spectroscopy is also useful for aldehydes and ketones because their carbonyl carbons show resonances in
the 190 to 215  range. 1H NMR is useful for aldehyde -CHO protons, which absorb near 10 . Aldehydes and
ketones undergo two characteristic kinds of fragmentation in the mass spectrometer:  cleavage and McLafferty
rearrangement.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Carboxylic acids are present in many industrial processes and most biological pathways

and are the starting materials from which other acyl derivatives are made. Thus, an understanding of their

properties and reactions is fundamental to understanding organic chemistry. We'll look both at acids and at

their close relatives, nitriles (  ), in this chapter and at carboxylic acid derivatives in the next chapter.

Carboxylic acids, RCO2H, occupy a central place among carbonyl compounds. Not only are they valuable in
themselves, they also serve as starting materials for preparing numerous carboxylic acid derivatives such
as acid chlorides, esters, amides, and thioesters. In addition, carboxylic acids are present in the majority of
biological pathways.
714  20 · Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     A great many carboxylic acids are found in nature: acetic acid, CH3CO2H, is the chief organic component of
     vinegar; butanoic acid, CH3CH2CH2CO2H, is responsible for the rancid odor of sour butter; and hexanoic acid
     (caproic acid), CH3(CH2)4CO2H, is responsible for the unmistakable aroma of goats and dirty gym socks (the
     name comes from the Latin caper, meaning "goat"). Other examples are cholic acid, a major component of
     human bile, and long-chain aliphatic acids such as palmitic acid, CH3(CH2)14CO2H, a biological precursor of
     fats and vegetable oils.

     Approximately 20 million tons of acetic acid is produced worldwide each year for a variety of purposes,
     including preparation of the vinyl acetate polymer used in paints and adhesives. About 20% of the acetic acid
     synthesized industrially is obtained by oxidation of acetaldehyde. Much of the remaining 80% is prepared by
     the rhodium-catalyzed reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide.

     20.1 Naming Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     Carboxylic Acids, RCO2H

     Simple carboxylic acids derived from open-chain alkanes are systematically named by replacing the terminal
     -e of the corresponding alkane name with -oic acid. The -CO2H carbon atom is numbered C1.

     Compounds that have a -CO2H group bonded to a ring are named using the suffix -carboxylic acid. The CO2H
     carbon is attached to C1 in this system and is not itself numbered. As a substituent, the CO2H group is called a
     carboxyl group.

Because many carboxylic acids were among the first organic compounds to be isolated and purified, quite a few
common names exist (TABLE 20.1). Biological chemists, in particular, make frequent use of these names, so you
may find yourself referring back to this list on occasion. We'll use systematic names in this book, with a few
exceptions such as formic (methanoic) acid and acetic (ethanoic) acid, whose names are accepted by IUPAC and
are so well known that it makes little sense to refer to them any other way.

Also listed in TABLE 20.1 are the names of acyl groups  derived from the parent acids. Except for the

eight entries at the top of TABLE 20.1, whose names have a -yl ending, all other acyl groups are named using an

-oyl ending.

20.2 Structure and Properties of Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylic acids are similar in some respects to both ketones and alcohols. Like ketones, the carboxyl carbon

is sp2-hybridized, and carboxylic acid groups are therefore planar with       and   bond angles of

approximately 120° (TABLE 20.2).

              TABLE 20.2 Physical Parameters for Acetic Acid

              Bond angle (degrees) Bond length (pm)

                                  119                                    152

Like alcohols, carboxylic acids are strongly associated because of hydrogen-bonding. Most carboxylic acids
exist as cyclic dimers held together by two hydrogen bonds. This strong hydrogen-bonding has a noticeable
effect on boiling points, making carboxylic acids boil far less easily than their corresponding alcohols. Acetic
acid, for instance, has a boiling point of 117.9 °C, versus 78.3 °C for ethanol, even though both compounds have
two carbons.

The most obvious property of carboxylic acids is implied by their name: carboxylic acids are acidic. They
therefore react with bases such as NaOH and NaHCO3 to give metal carboxylate salts, RCO2- M+. Carboxylic
acids with more than six carbons are only slightly soluble in water, but the alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids
are often highly water-soluble. In fact, it's often possible to purify an acid by extracting its salt into aqueous
base, then reacidifying and extracting the pure acid back into an organic solvent.

Like other Brønsted-Lowry acids discussed in Section 2.7, carboxylic acids dissociate slightly in dilute aqueous
solution to give H3O+ and the corresponding carboxylate anions, RCO2-. The extent of dissociation is given by
an acidity constant, Ka.
718  20 · Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     A list of Ka values for various carboxylic acids is given in TABLE 20.3. For most, Ka is approximately 10-4 to 10-5.
     Acetic acid, for instance, has Ka = 1.75 × 10-5 at 25 °C, which corresponds to a pKa of 4.76. In practical terms, a
     Ka value near 10-5 means that only about 0.1% of the molecules in a 0.1 M solution are dissociated, as opposed
     to the 100% dissociation found with strong mineral acids like HCl.

     Although much weaker than mineral acids, carboxylic acids are nevertheless much stronger acids than alcohols
     and phenols. The Ka of ethanol, for example, is approximately 10-16, making it a weaker acid than acetic acid
     by a factor of 1011.

     Why are carboxylic acids so much more acidic than alcohols, even though both contain -OH groups? An alcohol
     dissociates to give an alkoxide ion, in which the negative charge is localized on a single electronegative atom. A
     carboxylic acid, however, gives a carboxylate ion, in which the negative charge is delocalized over two equivalent
     oxygen atoms (FIGURE 20.2). In resonance terms (Section 2.4), a carboxylate ion is a stabilized resonance
     hybrid of two equivalent structures. Since a carboxylate ion is more stable than an alkoxide ion, it is lower in
     energy and more favored in the dissociation equilibrium.

FIGURE 20.2 An alkoxide ion has its charge localized on one oxygen atom and is less stable, while a carboxylate ion has the charge
spread equally over both oxygens and is therefore more stable.

Experimental evidence for the equivalence of the two carboxylate oxygens comes from X-ray crystallographic

studies on sodium formate. Both carbon-oxygen bonds are 127 pm in length, midway between the  double

bond (120 pm) and the C-O single bond (134 pm) of formic acid. An electrostatic potential map of the formate

20.3 Biological Acids and the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

In acidic solution, at low pH, a carboxylic acid is completely undissociated and exists entirely as RCOH. In basic
solution, at high pH, a carboxylic acid is completely dissociated and exists entirely as RCO2-. Inside living cells,
however, the pH is neither acidic nor basic but is instead buffered to a nearly neutral pH of 3.5-4.5 in humans,
a value often referred to as physiological pH. In what form, then, do carboxylic acids exist inside cells? The
question is an important one for understanding the acid catalysts so often found in biological reactions.

If the pKa value of a given acid and the pH of the medium are known, the percentages of dissociated and
720  20 · Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     undissociated forms can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
     For any acid HA, we have

     which can be rearranged to give

     so

     This equation says that the logarithm of the concentration of dissociated acid [A-] divided by the concentration
     of undissociated acid [HA] is equal to the pH of the solution minus the pKa of the acid. Thus, if we know both the
     pH of the solution and the pKa of the acid, we can calculate the ratio of [A-] to [HA]. Furthermore, when pH = pKa,
     then HA and A- are present in equal amounts because log 1 = 0.
     As an example of how to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, let's find out what species are present in a
     0.0010 M solution of acetic acid at pH = 7.3. According to Table 20-3, the pKa of acetic acid is 4.76. From the
     Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we have

     In addition, we know that

     Solving the two simultaneous equations gives [A-] = 0.0010 M and [HA] = 3 × 10-6 M. In other words, at a
     physiological pH of 7.3, essentially 100% of acetic acid molecules in a 0.0010 M solution are dissociated to the
     acetate ion.
     What is true for acetic acid is also true for other carboxylic acids: At the physiological pH that occurs inside cells,
     carboxylic acids are almost entirely dissociated. To reflect this fact, we always refer to cellular carboxylic acids
     by the name of their anion--acetate, lactate, citrate, and so forth, rather than acetic acid, lactic acid, and citric
     acid.
     PROBLEM Calculate the percentages of dissociated and undissociated forms present in the following

             20-5 solutions:
                     (a) 0.0010 M glycolic acid (HOCH2CO2H; pKa = 3.83) at pH = 4.50

     20.4 Substituent Effects on Acidity

     The listing of pKa values shown previously in TABLE 20.3 indicates that there are substantial differences in
     acidity from one carboxylic acid to another. For example, trifluoroacetic acid (Ka = 0.59) is 33,000 times as
     strong as acetic acid (Ka = 1.75 × 10-5). How can we account for such differences?
     Because the dissociation of a carboxylic acid is an equilibrium process, any factor that stabilizes the carboxylate
     anion relative to undissociated carboxylic acid will drive the equilibrium toward increased dissociation and
     result in increased acidity. For instance, three electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms delocalize the negative
     charge in the trifluoroacetate anion, thereby stabilizing the ion and increasing the acidity of CF3CO2H. In
     the same way, glycolic acid (HOCH2CO2H; pKa = 3.83) is stronger than acetic acid because of the electron-
     withdrawing effect of the electronegative oxygen atom.

Because inductive effects operate through  bonds and are dependent on distance, the effect of halogen
substitution decreases as the substituent moves farther from the carboxyl. Thus, 2-chlorobutanoic acid has
pKa = 2.86, 3-chlorobutanoic acid has pKa = 4.05, and 4-chlorobutanoic acid has pKa = 4.52, similar to that of
butanoic acid itself.

Substituent effects on acidity are also found in substituted benzoic acids. We said during the discussion of
electrophilic aromatic substitution in Section 16.4 that substituents on the aromatic ring strongly affect
reactivity. Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups are activated toward further electrophilic substitution,
and aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups are deactivated. Exactly the same effects can be observed
on the acidity of substituted benzoic acids (TABLE 20.4).

                                        TABLE 20.4 Substituent Effects on the Acidity of p-Substituted Benzoic

As TABLE 20.4 shows, an electron-donating (activating) group such as methoxy decreases acidity by
destabilizing the carboxylate anion, and an electron-withdrawing (deactivating) group such as nitro increases
acidity by stabilizing the carboxylate anion.
722  20 · Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     Because it's much easier to measure the acidity of a substituted benzoic acid than it is to determine the relative
     reactivity of an aromatic ring toward electrophilic substitution, the correlation between the two effects is useful
     for predicting reactivity. If we want to know the effect of a certain substituent on electrophilic reactivity, we can
     simply find the acidity of the corresponding benzoic acid. Worked Example 20.1 gives an illustration.

             WORKED EXAMPLE 20.1

     Predicting the Effect of a Substituent on the Reactivity of an Aromatic Ring toward
     Electrophilic Substitution

     The pKa of p-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid is 3.6. Is the trifluoromethyl substituent an activating or deactivating
     group in electrophilic aromatic substitution?

     Strategy
     Decide whether p-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid is stronger or weaker than benzoic acid. A substituent that
     strengthens the acid is a deactivating group because it withdraws electrons, and a substituent that weakens the
     acid is an activating group because it donates electrons.

     Solution
     A pKa of 3.6 means that p-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid is stronger than benzoic acid, whose pKa is 4.19. Thus,
     the trifluoromethyl substituent favors dissociation by helping stabilize the negative charge. Trifluoromethyl
     must therefore be an electron-withdrawing, deactivating group.

20.5 Preparing Carboxylic Acids

Let's review briefly some of the methods for preparing carboxylic acids that we've seen in previous chapters.

  · Oxidation of a substituted alkylbenzene with KMnO4 gives a substituted benzoic acid (Section 16.8). Both
      primary and secondary alkyl groups can be oxidized, but tertiary groups are not affected.

· Oxidation of a primary alcohol or an aldehyde yields a carboxylic acid (Section 17.7 and Section 19.3).
   Primary alcohols are often oxidized with the Dess Martin periodinane, and aldehydes are similarly oxidized
   with alkaline KMnO4.

Hydrolysis of Nitriles

Carboxylic acids can be prepared from nitriles on heating with aqueous acid or base by a mechanism that we'll

discuss in Section 20.7. Since nitriles themselves are usually made by SN2 reaction of a primary or secondary
alkyl halide with CN-, the two-step sequence of cyanide displacement followed by nitrile hydrolysis is a good

way to make a carboxylic acid from an alkyl halide (  ). Note that the product acid has

one more carbon than the starting alkyl halide. One example occurs in a commercial route for the synthesis of

the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. (See Chapter 15 Chemistry Matters.)

Carboxylation of Grignard Reagents

Another method for preparing carboxylic acids is by reaction of a Grignard reagent with CO2 to yield a metal

carboxylate, followed by protonation to give a carboxylic acid. This carboxylation reaction is usually carried out

by bubbling a stream of dry CO2 gas through a solution of the Grignard reagent. The organomagnesium halide

adds to a  bond of carbon dioxide in a typical nucleophilic carbonyl addition reaction, and protonation of
724  20 · Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     the carboxylate by addition of aqueous HCl in a separate step then gives the free carboxylic acid. For example:

     As noted previously, there are no Grignard reagents inside living cells, but there are other types of stabilized
     carbanions that are often carboxylated. One of the initial steps in fatty-acid biosynthesis, for instance, involves
     the formation of a carbanion from acetyl CoA, followed by carboxylation to yield malonyl CoA.

SN2 reactions. Like ketones, carboxylic acids undergo addition of nucleophiles to the carbonyl group. However,
carboxylic acids also undergo other reactions characteristic of neither alcohols nor ketones. FIGURE 20.3 shows
some of the general reactions of carboxylic acids.

20.7 Chemistry of Nitriles

Nitriles are analogous to carboxylic acids in that both have a carbon atom with three bonds to an electronegative
atom and both contain a  bond. Thus, some reactions of nitriles and carboxylic acids are similar. Both kinds of
compounds are electrophiles, for instance, and both undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.

Nitriles occur infrequently in living organisms, although several hundred examples are known. Cyanocycline
A, for instance, has been isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces lavendulae and was found to have both
antimicrobial and antitumor activity. In addition, more than 1000 compounds called cyanogenic glycosides
are known. Derived primarily from plants, cyanogenic glycosides contain a sugar with an acetal carbon, one
oxygen of which is bonded to a nitrile-bearing carbon (sugar-O-C-CN). On hydrolysis with aqueous acid, the
acetal is cleaved (Section 19.10), generating a cyanohydrin (HO-C-CN), which releases hydrogen cyanide. It's
thought that the primary function of cyanogenic glycosides is to protect the plant by poisoning any animal
foolish enough to eat it. Lotaustralin from the cassava plant is an example.
726  20 · Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     Preparation of Nitriles

     The simplest method of nitrile preparation is the SN2 reaction of CN- with a primary or secondary alkyl halide,
     as discussed in Section 20.5. Another method for preparing nitriles is by dehydration of a primary amide,
     RCONH2. Thionyl chloride is often used for this reaction, although other dehydrating agents such as POCl3 also
     work.

     The dehydration occurs by initial reaction of SOCl2 on the nucleophilic amide oxygen atom, followed by
     deprotonation and a subsequent E2-like elimination reaction.

     Both methods of nitrile synthesis--SN2 displacement by CN- on an alkyl halide and amide dehydration--are
     useful, but the synthesis from amides is more general because it is not limited by steric hindrance.

     Reactions of Nitriles

     Like a carbonyl group, a nitrile group is strongly polarized and has an electrophilic carbon atom. Nitriles
     therefore react with nucleophiles to yield sp2-hybridized imine anions in a reaction analogous to the formation
     of a sp3-hybridized alkoxide ion by nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group.

Hydrolysis: Conversion of Nitriles into Carboxylic Acids
Among the most useful reactions of nitriles is their hydrolysis to yield first an amide and then a carboxylic acid
plus ammonia or an amine. The reaction occurs in either basic or acidic aqueous solution:

As shown in FIGURE 20.5, base-catalyzed nitrile hydrolysis involves nucleophilic addition of hydroxide ion to

the polar  bond to give an imine anion in a process similar to the nucleophilic addition to a polar

bond to give an alkoxide anion. Protonation then gives a hydroxy imine, which tautomerizes (Section 9.4) to an

amide in a step similar to the tautomerization of an enol to a ketone. Further hydrolysis gives a carboxylate ion.

     Mechanism for the basic hydrolysis of a nitrile to yield an amide, which is then
     hydrolyzed further to a carboxylic acid anion.

     The further hydrolysis of the amide intermediate takes place by a nucleophilic addition of hydroxide ion to
     the amide carbonyl group, which yields a tetrahedral alkoxide ion. Expulsion of amide ion, NH2-, as leaving
     group gives the carboxylate ion, thereby driving the reaction toward the products. Subsequent acidification in a

     separate step yields the carboxylic acid. We'll look at this process in more detail in Section 21.7.

     Reduction: Conversion of Nitriles into Amines

     Reduction of a nitrile with LiAlH4 gives a primary amine, RNH2. The reaction occurs by nucleophilic addition

     of hydride ion to the polar         bond, yielding an imine anion, which still contains a  bond and therefore

     undergoes a second nucleophilic addition of hydride to give a dianion. Both monoanion and dianion

     intermediates are undoubtedly stabilized by Lewis acid-base complexation to an aluminum species, facilitating

     the second addition that would otherwise be difficult. Protonation of the dianion by addition of water in a

     subsequent step gives the amine.

Reaction of Nitriles with Grignard Reagents
Grignard reagents add to a nitrile to give an intermediate imine anion that is hydrolyzed by addition of water to

This reaction is similar to the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, except that only one nucleophilic addition
occurs rather than two and the attacking nucleophile is a carbanion (R:-) rather than a hydride ion. For example:

     20.8 Spectroscopy of Carboxylic Acids and Nitriles

     Infrared Spectroscopy

     Carboxylic acids have two characteristic IR absorptions that make the -CO2H group easily identifiable. The O-H
     bond of the carboxyl group gives rise to a very broad absorption over the range 2500 to 3300 cm-1. The

     bond shows an absorption between 1710 and 1760 cm-1. The exact position of                    absorption depends both

     on the structure of the molecule and on whether the acid is free (monomeric) or hydrogen-bonded (dimeric).

     Free carboxyl groups absorb at 1760 cm-1, but the more commonly encountered dimeric carboxyl groups

     absorb in a broad band centered around 1710 cm-1. As with other carbonyl-containing functional groups,

     conjugation with an alkene or benzene ring lowers the frequency of the  stretch by 20 to 30 cm-1.

     Both the broad O-H absorption and the    absorption at 1710 cm-1 (dimeric) are identified in the IR

     spectrum of butanoic acid shown in FIGURE 20.6.

     compounds and 2230 cm-1 for aromatic and conjugated molecules. Few other functional groups absorb in this

In the 1H NMR spectrum, the acidic -CO2H proton normally absorbs as a singlet near 12 . The chemical shift
of the carboxyl proton is concentration and solvent dependent, as these variables can change the extent of
hydrogen-bonding in the sample. In some cases, the carboxyl-proton resonance is broadened to the point of
being nearly undetectable. Traces of water in the sample can exacerbate the situation. As with alcohols (Section
17.11), the -CO2H proton can be replaced by deuterium when D2O is added to the sample tube, causing the
absorption to disappear from the NMR spectrum. FIGURE 20.7 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of phenylacetic
acid. Note that the -CO2H absorption occurs at 12.0 .

Vitamin C

The word vitamin, despite its common usage, is actually an imprecise term. Generally speaking, a vitamin
is an organic substance that a given organism requires in small amounts to live and grow but is unable to
synthesize and must obtain in its diet. Thus, to be considered a vitamin, only a small amount of the substance
is needed--anywhere from a few micrograms to 100 mg or so per day. Dietary substances needed in larger
amounts, such as some amino acids and unsaturated fats, are not considered vitamins.

FIGURE 20.8 In addition to the hazards of weather, participants in early polar expeditions often suffered from scurvy, caused by a dietary
vitamin C deficiency. (credit: "Shackleton's expedition to the Antarctic last moments of the Endurance" by Underwood & Underwood/
Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Furthermore, different organisms need different vitamins. More than 4000 species of mammals can synthesize
ascorbic acid in their bodies, for instance, but humans are not among them. Ascorbic acid is therefore a human
vitamin--what we all know as vitamin C--and must be provided by our diet. Small amounts of more than a dozen
other substances are similarly required by humans: retinol (vitamin A), thiamine (vitamin B1), and tocopherol
(vitamin E), for instance.
Vitamin C is surely the best known of all human vitamins. It was the first to be discovered (1912), the first to be
isolated (1928), the first to be structurally characterized (1933), and the first to be synthesized in the laboratory
(1933). Over 121,000 tons of vitamin C is synthesized worldwide each year, more than the total amount of all
other vitamins combined. In addition to its use as a supplement, vitamin C is used as a food preservative, a
"flour improver" in bakeries, and an animal-food additive.

Vitamin C is perhaps most well-known for its antiscorbutic properties, meaning that it prevents the onset of
scurvy, a bleeding disease affecting those with a deficiency of fresh vegetables and citrus fruits in their diet.
Sailors in the Age of Exploration were particularly susceptible to scurvy, and the death toll was high. The

Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama lost more than half his crew to scurvy during his two-year voyage around
the Cape of Good Hope in 1497-1499.

More recently, large doses of vitamin C have been claimed to prevent the common cold, cure infertility, delay
the onset of symptoms in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and inhibit the development of gastric
and cervical cancers. None of these claims have been backed by medical evidence, however. In the largest study
yet of the effect of vitamin C on the common cold, a meta-analysis of more than 100 separate trials covering
40,000 people found no difference in the incidence of colds between those who took supplemental vitamin C
regularly and those who did not. When taken during a cold, however, vitamin C does appear to decrease the
cold's duration by perhaps a day.

The industrial preparation of vitamin C involves an unusual blend of biological and laboratory organic
chemistry, beginning with glucose and following the five-step route shown in FIGURE 20.9. Glucose, a
pentahydroxy aldehyde, is first reduced to sorbitol, which is then oxidized by the microorganism Acetobacter
suboxydans. No chemical reagent is known that is selective enough to oxidize only one of the six alcohol groups
in sorbitol, so an enzymatic reaction is used. Treatment with acetone and an acid catalyst then converts four
of the other hydroxyl groups into acetal linkages, and the remaining hydroxyl group is chemically oxidized to a
carboxylic acid by reaction with aqueous NaOCl (household bleach). Hydrolysis with acid then removes the two
acetal groups and causes an internal ester-forming reaction to give ascorbic acid. Each of the five steps has a
yield better than 90%.

Summary

Carboxylic acids are among the most useful building blocks for synthesizing other molecules, both in nature

and in the laboratory. Thus, an understanding of their properties and reactions is fundamental to

understanding biological chemistry. In this chapter, we've looked both at acids and at their close relatives,

nitriles (  ).
734 20 · Summary of Reactions

Carboxylic acids are named systematically by replacing the terminal -e of the corresponding alkane name with
-oic acid. Like aldehydes and ketones, the carbonyl carbon atom is sp2-hybridized; like alcohols, carboxylic

acids are associated through hydrogen-bonding and therefore have high boiling points.

The distinguishing characteristic of carboxylic acids is their acidity. Although weaker than mineral acids such
as HCl, carboxylic acids dissociate much more readily than alcohols because the resultant carboxylate ions are
stabilized by resonance between two equivalent forms.

Most carboxylic acids have pKa values near 5, but the exact pKa of a given acid depends on structure. Carboxylic
acids substituted by electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic (have a lower pKa) because their carboxylate
ions are stabilized. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-donating groups are less acidic (have a higher pKa)
because their carboxylate ions are destabilized. The extent of dissociation of a carboxylic acid in a buffered

solution of a given pH can be calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Inside living cells, where

the physiological pH = 7.3, carboxylic acids are entirely dissociated and exist as their carboxylate anions.

Methods of synthesis for carboxylic acids include (1) oxidation of alkylbenzenes, (2) oxidation of primary

alcohols or aldehydes, (3) reaction of Grignard reagents with CO2 (carboxylation), and (4) hydrolysis of nitriles.
General reactions of carboxylic acids include (1) loss of the acidic proton, (2) nucleophilic acyl substitution at
the carbonyl group, (3) substitution on the  carbon, and (4) reduction.

Nitriles are similar in some respects to carboxylic acids and are prepared either by SN2 reaction of an alkyl
halide with cyanide ion or by dehydration of an amide. Nitriles undergo nucleophilic addition to the polar
bond in the same way that carbonyl compounds do. The most important reactions of nitriles are their hydrolysis
to carboxylic acids, reduction to primary amines, and reaction with Grignard reagents to yield ketones.

Carboxylic acids and nitriles are easily distinguished spectroscopically. Acids show a characteristic IR

absorption at 2500 to 3300 cm-1 due to the O-H bond and another at 1710 to 1760 cm-1 due to the  bond;

nitriles have an absorption at 2250 cm-1. Acids also show 13C NMR absorptions at 165 to 185  and 1H NMR

absorptions near 12 . Nitriles have a 13C NMR absorption in the range 115 to 130 .

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Carboxylic acid derivatives are among the most widely occurring of all molecules, both
in laboratory chemistry and in biological pathways. Thus, a study of them and their primary
reaction--nucleophilic acyl substitution--is fundamental to understanding organic chemistry. We'll begin this
chapter by first learning about carboxylic acid derivatives, and we'll then explore the chemistry of acyl
substitution reactions.
Closely related to the carboxylic acids and nitriles discussed in the previous chapter are the carboxylic acid
746  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     derivatives, compounds in which an acyl group is bonded to an electronegative atom or substituent that can act
     as a leaving group in the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction that we saw briefly in the Preview of Carbonyl
     Chemistry:

     Many kinds of acid derivatives are known, but we'll be concerned primarily with four of the most common
     ones: acid halides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides. Acid halides and acid anhydrides are used only in
     the laboratory, while esters and amides are common in both laboratory and biological chemistry. In addition,
     carboxylic acid derivatives called thioesters and acyl phosphates are encountered primarily in biological
     chemistry. Note the structural similarity between acid anhydrides and acyl phosphates.

     21.1 Naming Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

     Acid Halides, RCOX

     Acid halides are named by identifying first the acyl group and then the halide. As described in Section 20.1
     and shown in TABLE 20.1, the acyl group name is derived from the carboxylic acid name by replacing the -ic
     acid or -oic acid ending with -oyl, or the -carboxylic acid ending with -carbonyl. To keep things interesting,
     however, IUPAC recognizes eight exceptions for which a -yl rather than an -oyl ending is used: formic (formyl),
     acetic (acetyl), propionic (propionyl), butyric (butyryl), oxalic (oxalyl), malonic (malonyl), succinic (succinyl),
     and glutaric (glutaryl).

     Acid Anhydrides, RCO2COR

     Symmetrical anhydrides of unsubstituted monocarboxylic acids and cyclic anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids are
     named by replacing the word acid with anhydride.

     Unsymmetrical anhydrides--those prepared from two different carboxylic acids--are named by listing the two
     acids alphabetically and then adding anhydride.

Esters, RCO2R

Esters are named by first identifying the alkyl group attached to oxygen and then the carboxylic acid, with the
-ic acid ending replaced by -ate.

Amides, RCONH2

Amides with an unsubstituted -NH2 group are named by replacing the -oic acid or -ic acid ending with -amide,
or by replacing the -carboxylic acid ending with -carboxamide.

If the nitrogen atom is further substituted, the compound is named by first identifying the substituent groups
and then the parent amide. The substituents are preceded by the letter N to identify them as being directly
attached to nitrogen.

Thioesters, RCOSR

Thioesters are named like the corresponding esters. If the related ester has a common name, the prefix thio-
is added to the name of the carboxylate: acetate becomes thioacetate, for instance. If the related ester has a
systematic name, the -oate or -carboxylate ending is replaced by -thioate or -carbothioate: butanoate becomes
butanethioate and cyclohexanecarboxylate becomes cyclohexanecarbothioate, for instance.

Acyl Phosphates, RCO2PO32- and RCO2PO3R-

Acyl phosphates are named by citing the acyl group and adding the word phosphate. If an alkyl group is attached
to one of the phosphate oxygens, it is identified after the name of the acyl group. In biological chemistry, acyl

     adenosyl phosphates are particularly common.

21.2 Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

The addition of a nucleophile to a polar   bond is the key step in three of the four major carbonyl-group

reactions. We saw in the chapter on Aldehydes and Ketones: Nucleophilic Addition Reactions that when a

nucleophile adds to an aldehyde or ketone, the initially formed tetrahedral intermediate can be protonated to

yield an alcohol. When a nucleophile adds to a carboxylic acid derivative, however, a different reaction path is

taken. The initially formed tetrahedral intermediate eliminates one of the two substituents originally bonded to

the carbonyl carbon, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction (FIGURE 21.2).

FIGURE 21.2 The general mechanisms of nucleophilic addition and nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions. Both reactions begin with

addition of a nucleophile to a polar  bond to give a tetrahedral, alkoxide ion intermediate. (a) The intermediate formed from an aldehyde

or ketone is protonated to give an alcohol, but (b) the intermediate formed from a carboxylic acid derivative expels a leaving group to give a

new carbonyl compound.

The difference in behavior between aldehydes/ketones and carboxylic acid derivatives is a consequence of
structure. Carboxylic acid derivatives have an acyl carbon bonded to a group -Y that can act as a leaving group,
often as a stable anion. As soon as the tetrahedral intermediate is formed, the leaving group is expelled to
generate a new carbonyl compound. Aldehydes and ketones, however, have no such leaving group, however, and
therefore don't undergo substitution.
750  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     The net effect of the addition/elimination sequence is a substitution of the nucleophile for the -Y group that was
     originally bonded to the acyl carbon. Thus, the overall reaction is superficially similar to the kind of nucleophilic
     substitution that occurs during an SN2 reaction (Section 11.3), but the mechanisms of the two reactions are
     completely different. An SN2 reaction occurs in a single step by backside displacement of the leaving group,
     while a nucleophilic acyl substitution takes place in two steps and involves a tetrahedral intermediate.
     PROBLEM Show the mechanism of the following nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, using curved arrows

             21-3 to indicate the electron flow in each step:

     Relative Reactivity of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

     Both the initial addition step and the subsequent elimination step can affect the overall rate of a nucleophilic
     acyl substitution reaction, but the addition is usually the rate-limiting step. Thus, any factor that makes the
     carbonyl group more reactive toward nucleophiles favors the substitution process.
     Steric and electronic factors are both important in determining reactivity. Sterically, we find within a series of
     similar acid derivatives that unhindered, accessible carbonyl groups react with nucleophiles more readily than
     do sterically hindered carbonyl groups. The reactivity order is

     Electronically, we find that strongly polarized acyl compounds react more readily than less polar ones. Thus,

     acid chlorides are the most reactive because the electronegative chlorine atom withdraws electrons from

     the carbonyl carbon, whereas amides are the least reactive. Although subtle, electrostatic potential maps of

     various carboxylic acid derivatives indicate these differences by the relative blueness on the  carbons. Acyl

     phosphates are hard to place on this scale because they are not often used in the laboratory, but in biological

     systems they appear to be somewhat more reactive than thioesters.

21.2 · Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions                                                                                              751

The way in which various substituents affect the polarization of a carbonyl group is similar to the way they
affect the reactivity of an aromatic ring toward electrophilic substitution (Section 16.4). A chlorine substituent,
for example, inductively withdraws electrons from an acyl group in the same way that it withdraws electrons
from and thus deactivates an aromatic ring. Similarly, amino, methoxyl, and methylthio substituents donate
electrons to acyl groups by resonance in the same way that they donate electrons to, and thus activate, aromatic
rings.

As a consequence of these reactivity differences, it's usually possible to convert a more reactive acid derivative
into a less reactive one. Acid chlorides, for instance, can be directly converted into anhydrides, thioesters,
esters, and amides, but amides can't be directly converted into esters, thioesters, anhydrides, or acid chlorides.
Remembering the reactivity order is therefore a way to keep track of a large number of reactions (FIGURE
21.3). Another consequence, as noted previously, is that only acyl phosphates, thioesters, esters, and amides are
commonly found in nature. Acid halides and acid anhydrides react so rapidly with water that they can't exist for
long in living organisms.

FIGURE 21.3 Interconversions of carboxylic acid derivatives. A more reactive acid derivative can be converted into a less reactive one, but
not vice versa.

In studying the chemistry of carboxylic acid derivatives in the next few sections, we'll be concerned largely with
the reactions of just a few nucleophiles and will see that the same kinds of reactions tend to reoccur (FIGURE
21.4).

21.3 Reactions of Carboxylic Acids

The direct nucleophilic acyl substitution of a carboxylic acid is difficult because -OH is a poor leaving group
(Section 11.3). Thus, it's usually necessary to enhance the reactivity of the acid, either by using a strong
acid catalyst to protonate the carboxyl and make it a better acceptor or by converting the -OH into a better
leaving group. Under the right circumstances, however, acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, and amides can all
be prepared from carboxylic acids by nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions.

Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Acid Chlorides

In the laboratory, carboxylic acids are converted into acid chlorides by treatment with thionyl chloride, SOCl2.

This reaction occurs by a nucleophilic acyl substitution pathway in which the carboxylic acid is first converted
into an acyl chlorosulfite intermediate, thereby replacing the -OH of the acid with a much better leaving group.
The chlorosulfite then reacts with a nucleophilic chloride ion. You might recall from Section 17.6 that an
analogous chlorosulfite is involved in the reaction of an alcohol with SOCl2 to yield an alkyl chloride.

Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Acid Anhydrides

Acid anhydrides can be derived from two molecules of carboxylic acid by heating to remove 1 equivalent of
water. Because of the high temperatures needed, however, only acetic anhydride is commonly prepared this
754  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     way.

     Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Esters

     Perhaps the most useful reaction of carboxylic acids is their conversion into esters. There are many methods for
     accomplishing this, including the SN2 reaction of a carboxylate anion with a primary alkyl halide that we saw in
     Section 11.3.

     Esters can also be synthesized by an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of a carboxylic acid
     with an alcohol, a process called the Fischer esterification reaction. Unfortunately, the need for an excess of a
     liquid alcohol as solvent effectively limits the method to the synthesis of methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl esters.

     The mechanism of the Fischer esterification reaction is shown in FIGURE 21.5. Carboxylic acids are not reactive
     enough to undergo nucleophilic addition directly, but their reactivity is greatly enhanced in the presence of a
     strong acid such as HCl or H2SO4. The mineral acid protonates the carbonyl-group oxygen atom, thereby giving
     the carboxylic acid a positive charge and rendering it much more reactive toward nucleophiles. Subsequent loss
     of water from the tetrahedral intermediate yields the ester product.

FIGURE 21.5 MECHANISM

Mechanism of Fischer esterification. The reaction is an acid-catalyzed,
nucleophilic acyl substitution of a carboxylic acid.

The net effect of Fischer esterification is substitution of an -OH group by -OR. All steps are reversible, and the
reaction typically has an equilibrium constant close to 1. Thus, the reaction can be driven in either direction by
the choice of reaction conditions. Ester formation is favored when a large excess of alcohol is used as solvent,
but carboxylic acid formation is favored when a large excess of water is present.

Evidence in support of the mechanism shown in FIGURE 21.5 comes from isotope-labeling experiments. When
18O-labeled methanol reacts with benzoic acid, the methyl benzoate produced is found to be 18O-labeled
whereas the water produced is unlabeled. Thus, it is the C-OH bond of the carboxylic acid that is broken during
the reaction rather than the CO-H bond and the RO-H bond of the alcohol that is broken rather than the R-OH
bond.

     Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Amides

     Amides are difficult to prepare by direct reaction of carboxylic acids with amines because amines are bases

     that convert acidic carboxyl groups into their unreactive carboxylate anions. Thus, the -OH must be replaced

     by a better, nonacidic leaving group to carry out a nucleophilic acyl substitution. In practice, amides are

     often prepared by activating the carboxylic acid with a carbodiimide (            ), followed by addition

     of the amine. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDEC) are

     commonly used.

As shown in FIGURE 21.6, the acid first adds to a    double bond of DCC, and nucleophilic acyl substitution by

amine then ensues. Alternatively, and depending on the reaction solvent, the reactive acyl intermediate might

also react with a second equivalent of carboxylate ion to generate an acid anhydride that then reacts with the

amine. The product from either pathway is the same.

Conversion of Carboxylic Acids into Alcohols

We said in Section 17.4 that carboxylic acids are reduced by LiAlH4 to give primary alcohols, but we deferred
a discussion of the reaction mechanism at that time. In fact, the reduction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution
reaction in which -H replaces -OH to give an aldehyde that is further reduced by nucleophilic addition to
produce a primary alcohol. The aldehyde intermediate is much more reactive than the starting acid, so it reacts
instantly and is not isolated.

Because hydride ion is a base as well as a nucleophile, the actual nucleophilic acyl substitution step takes place
on the carboxylate ion rather than on the free carboxylic acid and gives a high-energy dianion intermediate.
In this intermediate, the two oxygens are complexed to a Lewis acidic aluminum species. Thus, the reaction is
relatively difficult, and acid reductions require higher temperatures and extended reaction times.

Alternatively, borane in tetrahydrofuran (BH3/THF) is a useful reagent for reducing carboxylic acids to primary
alcohols. Reaction of an acid with BH3/THF occurs rapidly at room temperature, and the procedure is often
preferred to reduction with LiAlH4 because of its relative ease and safety. Borane reacts with carboxylic acids
faster than with any other functional group, thereby allowing selective transformations such as that on
p-nitrophenylacetic acid. If the reduction of p-nitrophenylacetic acid were done with LiAlH4, both the nitro and
carboxyl groups would be reduced.

Biological Conversions of Carboxylic Acids

The direct conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl derivative by nucleophilic acyl substitution does not occur
in biological chemistry. As in the laboratory, the acid must first be activated by converting the -OH into a better
leaving group. This activation is often accomplished in living organisms by reaction of the acid with adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) to give an acyl adenosyl phosphate, or acyl adenylate, a mixed anhydride combining a
carboxylic acid and adenosine monophosphate (AMP, also known as adenylic acid). In the biosynthesis of fats,
for example, a long-chain carboxylic acid reacts with ATP to give an acyl adenylate, followed by subsequent
nucleophilic acyl substitution of a thiol group in coenzyme A to give the corresponding acyl CoA (FIGURE 21.7).

a nucleophilic acyl substitution on phosphorus. The carboxylate first adds to a     double bond, giving a five-

21.4 Chemistry of Acid Halides

Preparation of Acid Halides

Acid chlorides are prepared from carboxylic acids by reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl2), as we saw in
the previous section. Similar reaction of a carboxylic acid with phosphorus tribromide (PBr3) yields the acid
bromide.

Reactions of Acid Halides

Acid halides are among the most reactive of carboxylic acid derivatives and can be converted into many other
kinds of compounds by nucleophilic acyl substitution mechanisms. The halogen can be replaced by -OH to
yield an acid, by -OCOR to yield an anhydride, by -OR to yield an ester, by -NH2 to yield an amide, or by R to
yield a ketone. In addition, the reduction of an acid halide yields a primary alcohol, and reaction with a Grignard
reagent yields a tertiary alcohol. Although the reactions we'll be discussing in this section are illustrated only
for acid chlorides, similar processes take place with other acid halides.

Conversion of Acid Halides into Carboxylic Acids: Hydrolysis
Acid chlorides react with water to yield carboxylic acids. This hydrolysis reaction is a typical nucleophilic acyl
substitution process and is initiated by attack of water on the acid chloride carbonyl group. The tetrahedral
intermediate undergoes elimination of Cl- and loss of H+ to give the product carboxylic acid plus HCl.

Because HCl is formed during hydrolysis, the reaction is often carried out in the presence of a base such as
pyridine or NaOH to remove the HCl and prevent it from causing side reactions.
Conversion of Acid Halides into Anhydrides
Nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of an acid chloride with a carboxylate anion gives an acid anhydride.
Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical acid anhydrides can be prepared.

     Conversion of Acid Halides into Esters: Alcoholysis
     Acid chlorides react with alcohols to yield esters in a process analogous to their reaction with water to yield
     acids. In fact, this reaction is probably the most common method for preparing esters in the laboratory. As with
     hydrolysis, alcoholysis reactions are usually carried out in the presence of pyridine or NaOH to react with the
     HCl formed.

     The reaction of an alcohol with an acid chloride is strongly affected by steric hindrance. Bulky groups on
     either partner slow down the reaction considerably, resulting in a reactivity order among alcohols of primary >
     secondary > tertiary. As a result, it's often possible to selectively esterify an unhindered alcohol in the presence
     of a more hindered one. This can be important in complex syntheses in which it's sometimes necessary to
     distinguish between similar functional groups. For example,

     Conversion of Acid Halides into Amides: Aminolysis
     Acid chlorides react rapidly with ammonia and amines to give amides. As with the acid chloride-plus-alcohol
     method for preparing esters, this reaction of acid chlorides with amines is the most commonly used laboratory
     method for preparing amides. Both monosubstituted and disubstituted amines can be used, but not
     trisubstituted amines (R3N).

Because HCl is formed during the reaction, two equivalents of the amine must be used. One equivalent reacts
with the acid chloride, and one equivalent reacts with the HCl by-product to form an ammonium chloride salt.
If, however, the amine component is valuable, amide synthesis is often carried out using one equivalent of
the amine plus one equivalent of an inexpensive base such as NaOH. For example, the sedative trimetozine
is prepared commercially by reaction of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride with the amine morpholine in the
presence of one equivalent of NaOH.

Conversion of Acid Chlorides into Alcohols: Reduction and Grignard Reaction
Acid chlorides are reduced by LiAlH4 to yield primary alcohols. The reaction is of little practical value, however,
because the parent carboxylic acids are generally more readily available and can themselves be reduced by
LiAlH4 to yield alcohols.
764  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     Reduction occurs via a typical nucleophilic acyl substitution mechanism in which a hydride ion (H:-) adds to
     the carbonyl group, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that expels Cl-. The net effect is a substitution of -Cl by

     -H to yield an aldehyde, which is then further reduced by LiAlH4 in a second step to yield the primary alcohol.

     Grignard reagents react with acid chlorides to yield tertiary alcohols with two identical substituents. The
     mechanism of the reaction is similar to that of LiAlH4 reduction. The first equivalent of Grignard reagent adds
     to the acid chloride, loss of Cl- from the tetrahedral intermediate yields a ketone, and a second equivalent of
     Grignard reagent immediately adds to the ketone to produce an alcohol.

     Conversion of Acid Chlorides into Ketones: Diorganocopper Reaction
     The ketone intermediate formed in the reaction of an acid chloride with a Grignard reagent can't usually
     be isolated because addition of the second equivalent of organomagnesium reagent occurs too rapidly. A
     ketone can, however, be isolated from the reaction of an acid chloride with a lithium diorganocopper (Gilman)
     reagent, Li+ R2Cu-. The reaction occurs by initial nucleophilic acyl substitution on the acid chloride by the
     diorganocopper anion to yield an acyl diorganocopper intermediate, followed by loss of RCu and formation of
     the ketone.

     The reaction is generally carried out at -78 °C in ether solution, and yields are often excellent. For example,
     manicone, a substance secreted by male ants to coordinate ant pairing and mating, has been synthesized by
     reaction of lithium diethylcopper with (E)-2,4-dimethyl-2-hexenoyl chloride.

     Note that the diorganocopper reaction occurs only with acid chlorides. Carboxylic acids, esters, acid anhydrides,
     and amides do not react with lithium diorganocopper reagents.

21.5 Chemistry of Acid Anhydrides

Preparation of Acid Anhydrides

Acid anhydrides are typically prepared by nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of an acid chloride with a
carboxylate anion, as we saw in the previous section. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical acid anhydrides can
be prepared in this way.

Reactions of Acid Anhydrides

The chemistry of acid anhydrides is similar to that of acid chlorides, although anhydrides react more slowly.
Thus, acid anhydrides react with water to form acids, with alcohols to form esters, with amines to form amides,
and with LiAlH4 to form primary alcohols. Only the ester- and amide-forming reactions are commonly used,
however.

Conversion of Acid Anhydrides into Esters
Acetic anhydride is often used to prepare acetate esters from alcohols. For example, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)
is prepared commercially by the acetylation of o-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid) with acetic anhydride.
766  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     Conversion of Acid Anhydrides into Amides
     Acetic anhydride is also commonly used to prepare N-substituted acetamides from amines. For example,
     acetaminophen, a drug used in over-the-counter analgesics such as Tylenol, is prepared by reaction of
     p-hydroxyaniline with acetic anhydride. Only the more nucleophilic -NH2 group reacts rather than the less
     nucleophilic -OH group.

     Notice in both of the previous reactions that only "half" of the anhydride molecule is used, while the other
     half acts as the leaving group during the nucleophilic acyl substitution step and produces acetate ion as a
     by-product. Thus, anhydrides are inefficient, and acid chlorides are normally preferred for introducing acyl
     substituents other than acetyl groups.

     21.6 Chemistry of Esters

     Esters are among the most widespread of all naturally occurring compounds. Many simple esters are pleasant-
     smelling liquids that are responsible for the fragrant odors of fruits and flowers. For example, methyl butanoate
     is found in pineapple oil, and isopentyl acetate is a constituent of banana oil. The ester linkage is also present
     in animal fats and in many biologically important molecules.

     The chemical industry uses esters for a variety of purposes. Ethyl acetate, for instance, is a commonly used
     solvent, and dialkyl phthalates are used as plasticizers to keep polymers from becoming brittle. You may be
     aware that there is current concern about the possible toxicity of phthalates at high concentrations, although a
     recent assessment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found the risk to be minimal for most people, with
     the possible exception of male infants.

Preparation of Esters

Esters are usually prepared from carboxylic acids by the methods already discussed. Thus, carboxylic acids
are converted directly into esters by SN2 reaction of a carboxylate ion with a primary alkyl halide or by Fischer
esterification of a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid catalyst. In addition, acid
chlorides are converted into esters by treatment with an alcohol in the presence of base (Section 21.4).

Reactions of Esters

Esters undergo the same kinds of reactions that we've seen for other carboxylic acid derivatives, but they are
less reactive toward nucleophiles than either acid chlorides or anhydrides. All their reactions are applicable to
both acyclic and cyclic esters, called lactones.

Conversion of Esters into Carboxylic Acids: Hydrolysis
An ester is hydrolyzed, either by aqueous base or aqueous acid, to yield a carboxylic acid plus an alcohol.

Ester hydrolysis in basic solution is called saponification, after the Latin word sapo, meaning "soap." We'll see
in Section 27.2 that soap is in fact made by boiling animal fat with aqueous base to hydrolyze the ester linkages.
As shown in FIGURE 21.8, ester hydrolysis occurs through a typical nucleophilic acyl substitution pathway in
which hydroxide ion is the nucleophile that adds to the ester carbonyl group to give a tetrahedral intermediate.
Loss of alkoxide ion then gives a carboxylic acid, which is deprotonated to give the carboxylate ion. Addition of
aqueous HCl, in a separate step after the saponification is complete, protonates the carboxylate ion and gives
the carboxylic acid.
768  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     FIGURE 21.8 MECHANISM
     Mechanism of base-induced ester hydrolysis (saponification).

     The mechanism shown in FIGURE 21.8 is supported by isotope-labeling studies. When ethyl propanoate labeled
     with 18O in the ether-like oxygen is hydrolyzed in aqueous NaOH, the 18O label shows up exclusively in the
     ethanol product. None of the label remains with the propanoic acid, indicating that saponification occurs by
     cleavage of the C-OR bond rather than the CO-R bond.

     Acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis can occur by more than one mechanism, depending on the structure of the
     ester. The usual pathway, however, is just the reverse of a Fischer esterification reaction (Section 21.3). As
     shown in FIGURE 21.9, the ester is first activated toward nucleophilic attack by protonation of the carboxyl
     oxygen atom, and nucleophilic addition of water then occurs. Transfer of a proton and elimination of alcohol
     yields the carboxylic acid. Because this hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of a Fischer esterification reaction,
     FIGURE 21.9 is the reverse of FIGURE 21.5.

FIGURE 21.9 MECHANISM

Mechanism of acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis. The forward reaction is a

Ester hydrolysis is common in biological chemistry, particularly in the digestion of dietary fats and oils. We'll
save a complete discussion of the mechanistic details of fat hydrolysis until Section 29.2 but will note for
now that the reaction is catalyzed by various lipase enzymes and involves two sequential nucleophilic acyl
substitution reactions. The first is a transesterification reaction in which an alcohol group on the lipase adds
to an ester linkage in the fat molecule to give a tetrahedral intermediate that expels alcohol and forms an
acyl enzyme intermediate. The second is an addition of water to the acyl enzyme, followed by expulsion of the
enzyme to give a hydrolyzed acid and a regenerated enzyme.

     PROBLEM Why is the saponification of an ester irreversible? In other words, why doesn't treatment of a
           21-16 carboxylic acid with an alkoxide ion yield an ester?

     Conversion of Esters into Amides: Aminolysis
     Esters react with ammonia and amines to yield amides. The reaction is not often used, however, because it's
     usually easier to prepare an amide by starting with an acid chloride (Section 21.4).

     Conversion of Esters into Alcohols: Reduction
     Esters are easily reduced by treatment with LiAlH4 to yield primary alcohols (Section 17.4).

     The mechanism of ester reduction is similar to that of acid chloride reduction in that a hydride ion first adds
     to the carbonyl group, followed by elimination of alkoxide ion to yield an aldehyde. Further reduction of the
     aldehyde gives the primary alcohol.

     The aldehyde intermediate can be isolated if 1 equivalent of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAH, or DIBAL-
     H) is used as the reducing agent instead of LiAlH4. The reaction has to be carried out at -78 °C to avoid
     further reduction to the alcohol. Such partial reductions of carboxylic acid derivatives to aldehydes also occur

21.7 Chemistry of Amides

Amides, like esters, are abundant in all living organisms. Proteins, nucleic acids, and many pharmaceutical
agents have amide functional groups. The reason for this abundance of amides is that they are stable in the
aqueous conditions found in living organisms. Amides are the least reactive of the common acid derivatives and
undergo relatively few nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions.
772  21 · Carboxylic Acid Derivatives: Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution Reactions

     Preparation of Amides

     Amides are usually prepared by reaction of an amine with an acid chloride (Section 21.4). Ammonia,
     monosubstituted amines, and disubstituted amines all undergo the reaction.

     Reactions of Amides

     Conversion of Amides into Carboxylic Acids: Hydrolysis
     Amides undergo hydrolysis to yield carboxylic acids plus ammonia or an amine upon heating in either aqueous
     acid or aqueous base. The conditions required for amide hydrolysis are more extreme than those required for
     the hydrolysis of acid chlorides or esters, but the mechanisms are similar. Acidic hydrolysis reaction occurs by
     nucleophilic addition of water to the protonated amide, followed by transfer of a proton from oxygen to nitrogen
     to make the nitrogen a better leaving group, and subsequent elimination. The steps are reversible, with the
     equilibrium shifted toward product by protonation of NH3 in the final step.

     Basic hydrolysis occurs by nucleophilic addition of OH- to the amide carbonyl group, followed by elimination of
     amide ion (-NH2) and subsequent deprotonation of the initially formed carboxylic acid by ammonia. The steps
     are reversible, with the equilibrium shifted toward product by the final deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.
     Basic hydrolysis is substantially more difficult than the analogous acid-catalyzed reaction because amide ion is
     a very poor leaving group, making the elimination step difficult.

Amide hydrolysis is common in biological chemistry. Just as the hydrolysis of esters is the initial step in the
digestion of dietary fats, the hydrolysis of amides is the initial step in the digestion of dietary proteins. The
reaction is catalyzed by protease enzymes and occurs by a mechanism almost identical to what we just saw for
fat hydrolysis. That is, an initial nucleophilic acyl substitution of an alcohol group in the enzyme on an amide
linkage in the protein gives an acyl enzyme intermediate, which then undergoes hydrolysis.

Conversion of Amides into Amines: Reduction

Like other carboxylic acid derivatives, amides can be reduced by LiAlH4. The product of the reduction, however,
is an amine rather than an alcohol. The net effect of an amide reduction is thus the conversion of the amide

carbonyl group into a methylene group (        ). This kind of reaction is specific to amides and does not

occur with other carboxylic acid derivatives.

Amide reduction occurs by nucleophilic addition of hydride ion to the amide carbonyl group, followed by
expulsion of the oxygen atom as an aluminate anion leaving group to give an iminium ion intermediate. The
intermediate iminium ion is further reduced by LiAlH4 to yield the amine.

The reaction is effective with both acyclic and cyclic amides, or lactams, and is a good method for preparing
cyclic amines.

     21.8 Chemistry of Thioesters and Acyl Phosphates: Biological Carboxylic
     Acid Derivatives

     As mentioned in the chapter introduction, the substrate for a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction in living
     organisms is generally either a thioester (RCOSR) or an acyl phosphate (RCO2PO32- or RCO2PO3R-). Neither is
     as reactive as an acid chloride or acid anhydride, yet both are stable enough to exist in living organisms while

     still reactive enough to undergo acyl substitution.

     Acyl CoA's, such as acetyl CoA, are the most common thioesters in nature. Coenzyme A, abbreviated CoA, is a

     thiol formed by a phosphoric anhydride linkage (                            ) between phosphopantetheine and adenosine

     3,5-bisphosphate. (The prefix bis- means "two" and indicates that adenosine 3,5-bisphosphate has two

     phosphate groups, one on C3 and one on C5.) Reaction of coenzyme A with an acyl phosphate or acyl adenylate

     gives acyl CoA (FIGURE 21.10). As we saw in Section 21.3 (FIGURE 21.7), formation of the acyl adenylate occurs

     by reaction of a carboxylic acid with ATP and is itself a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction that takes place

     on phosphorus.

     21.9 Polyamides and Polyesters: Step-Growth Polymers

     When an amine reacts with an acid chloride, an amide is formed. What would happen, though, if a diamine
     and a diacid chloride were allowed to react? Each partner would form two amide bonds, linking more and more
     molecules together until a giant polyamide resulted. In the same way, reaction of a diol with a diacid would lead
     to a polyester.

     There are two main classes of synthetic polymers: chain-growth polymers and step-growth polymers. The
     polyethylene and other alkene and diene polymers that we saw in Section 8.10 and Section 14.6 are called
     chain-growth polymers because they are produced in chain-reaction processes. An initiator adds to a
     bond to give a reactive intermediate, which adds to a second alkene molecule to produce a new intermediate,
     which adds to a third molecule, and so on. By contrast, polyamides and polyesters are step-growth polymers
     because each bond in the polymer is formed independently in a discrete step, often the nucleophilic acyl
     substitution reaction of a carboxylic acid derivative. Some commercially important step-growth polymers are
     shown in TABLE 21.2.

The best known step-growth polymers are the polyamides, or nylons, first prepared in 1930 by Wallace

reaction of adipic acid (hexanedioic acid) with hexamethylenediamine (1,6-hexanediamine) at 280 °C. The
designation "66" indicates the number of carbon atoms in the diamine (the first 6) and the diacid (the second
6).

Nylons are used both in engineering applications and in making fibers. A combination of high impact strength
and abrasion resistance makes nylon an excellent metal substitute for bearings and gears. As fiber, nylon is
used in a variety of applications, from clothing to tire cord to ropes.

Polyesters

The most generally useful polyester is made by reaction between dimethyl terephthalate (dimethyl
1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and ethylene glycol (1,2-ethanediol). The product is used under the trade name
Dacron to make clothing fiber or tire cord and under the name Mylar to make recording tape. The tensile
strength of poly(ethylene terephthalate) film is nearly equal to that of steel.

     Lexan, a polycarbonate prepared from diphenyl carbonate and bisphenol A, is another commercially valuable
     polyester. Lexan has an unusually high impact strength, making it valuable for use in bicycle helmets and laptop
     cases.

     Sutures and Biodegradable Polymers

     Because plastics are too often thrown away rather than recycled, much work has been carried out on developing
     biodegradable polymers, which can be broken down rapidly in landfills by soil microorganisms. Among the
     most common biodegradable polymers are poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and
     poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). All are polyesters and are therefore susceptible to hydrolysis of their ester links.
     Copolymers of PGA with PLA have found a particularly wide range of uses. A 90/10 copolymer of poly(glycolic
     acid) with poly(lactic acid) is used to make absorbable sutures, for instance. The sutures are entirely hydrolyzed
     and absorbed by the body within 90 days after surgery.

     In Europe, interest has centered particularly on poly(hydroxybutyrate), which can be made into films for
     packaging as well as into molded items. The polymer degrades within four weeks in landfills, both by ester
     hydrolysis and by an E1cB elimination reaction of the oxygen atom  to the carbonyl group. The use of
     poly(hydroxybutyrate) is limited at present by its cost--about four times that of polypropylene.

21.10 Spectroscopy of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

Infrared Spectroscopy

All carbonyl-containing compounds have intense IR absorptions in the range 1650 to 1850 cm-1. As shown in
TABLE 21.3 the exact position of the absorption provides information about the specific kind of carbonyl group.
For comparison, the IR absorptions of aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids are included in the table, along
with values for carboxylic acid derivatives.

     TABLE 21.3 Infrared Absorptions of Some Carbonyl Compounds

     Saturated carboxylic acid Acetic acid                       1710

Acid chlorides are easily detected by their characteristic absorption near 1810 cm-1. Acid anhydrides can be
identified by a pair of absorptions in the carbonyl region, one at 1820 cm-1 and another at 1760 cm-1. Note

that each of these functional groups has a strong electron-withdrawing group attached to the carbonyl. The

inductive withdrawal of electron density shortens the C=O bond, thereby raising its stretching frequency. Esters
are detected by their absorption at 1735 cm-1, a position somewhat higher than that for either aldehydes or

ketones. Amides, by contrast, absorb near the low-wavenumber end of the carbonyl region, with the degree of

substitution on nitrogen affecting the exact position of the IR band. That is, for amides, the delocalization of

     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     Hydrogens on the carbon next to a carbonyl group are slightly deshielded and absorb near 2  in the 1H NMR
     spectrum, although the exact identity of the carbonyl group can't be determined. FIGURE 21.11 shows the 1H

     Although 13C NMR is useful for determining the presence or absence of a carbonyl group in a molecule, the
     identity of the carbonyl group is difficult to determine. Aldehydes and ketones absorb near 200 , while the
     carbonyl carbon atoms of various acid derivatives absorb in the range 160 to 180  (TABLE 21.4).

     CHEMISTRY MATTERS

-Lactam Antibiotics

You should never underestimate the value of hard work and logical thinking, but it's also true that blind luck
often plays a role in most real scientific breakthroughs. What has been called "the supreme example of luck in
all scientific history" occurred in the late summer of 1928, when the Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming
went on vacation, leaving in his lab a culture plate recently inoculated with the bacterium Staphylococcus
aureus.
While Fleming was away, an extraordinary chain of events occurred. First, a nine-day cold spell lowered the
laboratory temperature to a point where the Staphylococcus in the culture plate could not grow. During this
time, spores from a colony of the mold Penicillium notatum, being grown in a lab on the floor below, wafted
up into Fleming's lab and landed in the culture plate. The temperature then rose, and both Staphylococcus and
Penicillium began to grow. On returning from vacation, Fleming discarded the plate into a tray of antiseptic,
intending to sterilize it. Evidently, though, the plate did not sink deeply enough into the antiseptic, because
when Fleming happened to glance at it a few days later, what he saw changed the course of history. He noticed
that the growing Penicillium mold appeared to dissolve the colonies of staphylococci.
Fleming realized that the Penicillium mold must be producing a chemical that killed the Staphylococcus
bacteria, and he spent several years trying to isolate the substance. Finally, in 1939, the Australian pathologist
Howard Florey and the German refugee Ernst Chain managed to isolate the active substance, called penicillin.
The dramatic ability of penicillin to cure infections in mice was soon demonstrated, and successful tests in
humans followed shortly thereafter. By 1943, penicillin was being produced on a large scale for military use in
World War II, and by 1944 it was being used on civilians. Fleming, Florey, and Chain shared the 1945 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Now called benzylpenicillin, or penicillin G, the substance first discovered by Fleming is but one member of
a large class of so-called -lactam antibiotics, compounds with a four-membered lactam (cyclic amide) ring.
The four-membered lactam ring is fused to a five-membered, sulfur-containing ring, and the carbon atom next
to the lactam carbonyl group is bonded to an acylamino substituent, RCONH-. This acylamino side chain can
be varied in the laboratory to provide many hundreds of penicillin analogs with different biological activity
profiles. Ampicillin, for instance, has an -aminophenylacetamido substituent [PhCH(NH2)CONH-].

Closely related to the penicillins are the cephalosporins, a group of -lactam antibiotics that contain an
unsaturated, six-membered, sulfur-containing ring. Cephalexin, marketed under the trade name Keflex, is
an example. Cephalosporins generally have much greater antibacterial activity than penicillins, particularly
against resistant strains of bacteria.
782 21 · Key Terms

The biological activity of penicillins and cephalosporins is due to the presence of the strained -lactam ring,
which reacts with and deactivates the transpeptidase enzyme needed to synthesize and repair bacterial cell
walls. With the wall either incomplete or weakened, the bacterial cell ruptures and dies.

Summary

Carboxylic acid derivatives--compounds in which the -OH group of a carboxylic acid has been replaced by
another substituent--are among the most widely occurring of all molecules and are involved in almost all
biological pathways. In this chapter, we covered the chemistry necessary for understanding them and thus
also necessary for understanding living organisms. Acid halides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides are the
most common such derivatives in the laboratory; thioesters and acyl phosphates are common in biological
molecules.

The chemistry of carboxylic acid derivatives is dominated by the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction.
Mechanistically, these substitutions take place by addition of a nucleophile to the polar carbonyl group of the
acid derivative to give a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by expulsion of a leaving group.

The reactivity of an acid derivative toward substitution depends both on the steric environment near the
carbonyl group and on the electronic nature of the substituent, Y. The reactivity order is acid halide > acid
anhydride > thioester > ester > amide.
The most common reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives are substitution by water to yield an acid (hydrolysis),
by an alcohol to yield an ester (alcoholysis), by an amine to yield an amide (aminolysis), by hydride ion to yield

an alcohol (reduction), and by an organomagnesium halide to yield an alcohol (Grignard reaction).
Step-growth polymers, such as polyamides and polyesters, are prepared by reactions between difunctional
molecules. Polyamides (nylons) are formed by reaction between a diacid and a diamine; polyesters are formed
from a diacid and a diol.
IR spectroscopy is a valuable tool for the structural analysis of acid derivatives. Acid chlorides, anhydrides,
esters, and amides all show characteristic IR absorptions that can be used to identify these functional groups.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? As with nucleophilic additions and nucleophilic acyl substitutions, many laboratory
schemes, pharmaceutical syntheses, and biochemical pathways make frequent use of carbonyl -substitution
reactions. Their great value comes from the fact that they constitute one of the few general methods for forming
carbon-carbon bonds, thereby making it possible to build larger molecules from smaller precursors. In this
chapter, we'll see how and why these reactions occur.
We said in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry that much of the chemistry of carbonyl compounds can be
explained by just four fundamental reaction types: nucleophilic additions, nucleophilic acyl substitutions, 
substitutions, and carbonyl condensations. Having studied the first two of these reactions in the past three
chapters, let's now look in more detail at the third major carbonyl-group process--the -substitution reaction.
Alpha-substitution reactions occur at the position next to the carbonyl group--the  position--and involve the
substitution of an  hydrogen atom by an electrophile, E, through either an enol or enolate ion intermediate.
Let's begin by learning more about these two species.
798  22 · Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions

     22.1 Keto-Enol Tautomerism

     A carbonyl compound with a hydrogen atom on its  carbon is in equilibrium with its corresponding enol
     isomer (Section 9.4). This spontaneous interconversion between two isomers, usually with the change in
     position of a hydrogen, is called tautomerism, from the Greek tauto, meaning "the same," and meros, meaning
     "part." The individual keto and enol isomers are called tautomers.

     Note the difference between tautomers and resonance forms. Tautomers are constitutional isomers--different
     compounds with different structures--while resonance forms are different representations of a single
     compound. Tautomers have their atoms arranged differently, while resonance forms differ only in the position
     of their  and nonbonding electrons.
     Most monocarbonyl compounds exist almost entirely in their keto form at equilibrium, and it's usually difficult
     to isolate the pure enol. Cyclohexanone, for example, contains only about 0.0001% of its enol tautomer at
     room temperature. The percentage of enol tautomer is even lower for carboxylic acids, esters, and amides.
     The enol can only predominate when stabilized by conjugation or intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Thus,
     2,4-pentanedione is about 76% enol tautomer. Although enols are scarce at equilibrium, they are nevertheless
     responsible for much of the chemistry of carbonyl compounds because they are so reactive.

     Keto-enol tautomerism of carbonyl compounds is catalyzed by both acids and bases. Acid catalysis occurs by
     protonation of the carbonyl oxygen atom to give an intermediate cation that loses H+ from its  carbon to yield
     a neutral enol (FIGURE 22.2a). This proton loss from the cation intermediate is similar to what occurs during an
     E1 reaction when a carbocation loses H+ to form an alkene (Section 11.10).
     Base-catalyzed enol formation occurs because the presence of a carbonyl group makes the hydrogens on the
      carbon weakly acidic. Thus, a carbonyl compound can act as an acid and donate one of its  hydrogens

to a sufficiently strong base. The resultant resonance-stabilized anion, an enolate ion, is then protonated to
yield a neutral compound. If protonation of the enolate ion takes place on the  carbon, the keto tautomer
is regenerated and no net change occurs. If, however, protonation takes place on the oxygen atom, an enol
tautomer is formed (FIGURE 22.2b).

  FIGURE 22.2 MECHANISM

Note that only the hydrogens on the  position of carbonyl compounds are acidic. Hydrogens at , , , and so
on, aren't acidic and can't be removed by base because the resulting anions can't be resonance-stabilized by the
carbonyl group.

     22.2 Reactivity of Enols: -Substitution Reactions

     What kind of chemistry do enols have? Because their double bonds are electron-rich, enols behave as

     nucleophiles and react with electrophiles in much the same way that alkenes do. But because of resonance-

     electron donation of a lone pair of electrons on the neighboring oxygen, enols are more electron-rich and

     correspondingly more reactive than alkenes. Notice in the following electrostatic potential map of ethenol

     (  ) how there is a substantial electron density (yellow-red) on the  carbon.

     When an alkene reacts with an electrophile, E+, initial addition gives an intermediate cation and subsequent
     reaction with a nucleophile, such as a halide ion, yields an addition product (Section 7.7). When an enol reacts
     with an electrophile, however, only the initial addition step is the same (FIGURE 22.3). Instead of reacting with a
     nucleophile to give an addition product, the intermediate cation loses the -OH proton to give an -substituted
     carbonyl compound.

FIGURE 22.3 MECHANISM

22.3 Alpha Halogenation of Aldehydes and Ketones

A particularly common -substitution reaction in the laboratory is the halogenation of aldehydes and ketones
at their  positions by reaction with Cl2, Br2, or I2 in acidic solution. Bromine in acetic acid solvent is often used.

Remarkably, ketone halogenation also occurs in biological systems, particularly in marine alga, where
dibromoacetaldehyde, bromoacetone, 1,1,1-tribromoacetone, and other related compounds have been found.

This form of halogenation is a typical -substitution reaction that proceeds by acid-catalyzed formation of an
enol intermediate, as shown in FIGURE 22.4.
802  22 · Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions

     FIGURE 22.4 MECHANISM
     Mechanism of the acid-catalyzed bromination of acetone.

     Evidence for the mechanism shown in FIGURE 22.4 includes the observation that acid-catalyzed halogenations
     show second-order kinetics and follow the rate law

     In other words, the rate of halogenation depends only on the concentrations of ketone and acid and is
     independent of halogen concentration. Since halogen is not involved in the rate-limiting step, chlorination,
     bromination, and iodination of a given substrate all occur at the same rate.
     Furthermore, if an aldehyde or ketone is treated with D3O+, the acidic  hydrogens are replaced by deuterium.
     For a given ketone, the rate of deuterium exchange is identical to the rate of halogenation, implying that a
     common intermediate--presumably the enol--is involved in both processes.

-Bromo ketones are useful in the laboratory because they can be dehydrobrominated by base treatment to
yield ,-unsaturated ketones. For example, 2-methylcyclohexanone gives 2-bromo-2-methylcyclohexanone
on halogenation, and the -bromo ketone gives 2-methyl-2-cyclohexenone when heated in pyridine. The
reaction takes place by an E2 elimination pathway (Section 11.8) and is a good method for introducing a
bond into a molecule. Note that bromination of 2-methylcyclohexanone occurs primarily on the more highly
substituted  position because the more highly substituted enol is favored over the less highly substituted one
(Section 7.6).

22.4 Alpha Bromination of Carboxylic Acids

The  bromination of carbonyl compounds by Br2 in acetic acid is limited to aldehydes and ketones because
acids, esters, and amides don't enolize to a sufficient extent. Carboxylic acids, however, can be  brominated by
a mixture of Br2 and PBr3 in the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii (HVZ) reaction.

The Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction is a bit more complex than it looks and actually involves  substitution
of an acid bromide enol rather than a carboxylic acid enol. The process begins by reaction of the carboxylic
acid with PBr3 to form an acid bromide plus HBr (Section 21.4). The HBr then catalyzes enolization of the
acid bromide, and the resultant enol reacts with Br2 in an -substitution reaction to give an -bromo acid
bromide. Addition of water hydrolyzes the acid bromide in a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction and yields
the -bromo carboxylic acid product.

     22.5 Acidity of Alpha Hydrogen Atoms: Enolate Ion Formation

     As noted in Section 22.1, a hydrogen on the  position of a carbonyl compound is weakly acidic and can be
     removed by a strong base to yield an enolate ion. In comparing acetone (pKa = 19.3) with ethane (pKa  60), for
     instance, the presence of a neighboring carbonyl group increases the acidity of the ketone over the alkane by a
     factor of 1040.

     Proton abstraction from a carbonyl compound occurs when the  C-H bond is oriented roughly parallel to the
     p orbitals of the carbonyl group. The  carbon atom of the enolate ion is sp2-hybridized and has a p orbital that
     overlaps the neighboring carbonyl p orbitals. Thus, the negative charge is shared by the electronegative oxygen
     atom, and the enolate ion is stabilized by resonance (FIGURE 22.5).

     FIGURE 22.5 Mechanism of enolate-ion formation by abstraction of an  proton from a carbonyl compound. The enolate ion is stabilized
     by resonance, and the negative charge (red) is shared by the oxygen and the  carbon atom, as indicated in the electrostatic potential map.

     Because carbonyl compounds are only weakly acidic, a strong base is needed for the formation of an enolate-
     ion. If an alkoxide ion, such as sodium ethoxide, is used as base, deprotonation of acetone only takes place to
     the extent of about 0.1% because acetone is a weaker acid than ethanol (pKa = 16). If, however, a more powerful
     base is used, then a carbonyl compound is completely converted into its enolate ion.

In practice, the strong base lithium diisopropylamide [LiN(i-C3H7)2; abbreviated LDA] is commonly used for
making enolate ions. As the lithium salt of the weak acid diisopropylamine, pKa = 36, LDA can readily
deprotonate most carbonyl compounds. It is easily prepared by reaction of butyllithium with diisopropylamine

and is soluble in organic solvents because of its two alkyl groups.

Many types of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, esters, thioesters, acids, and amides, can be
converted into enolate ions by reaction with LDA. TABLE 22.1 lists the approximate pKa values of different types
of carbonyl compounds and shows how these values compare to other acidic substances we've seen. Note that
nitriles, too, are acidic and can be converted into enolate-like anions.

     When a hydrogen atom is flanked by two carbonyl groups, its acidity is enhanced further. TABLE 22.1 thus
     shows that 1,3-diketones (-diketones), 3-oxo esters (-keto esters), and 1,3-diesters (malonic esters) are more
     acidic than water. The enolate ions derived from these -dicarbonyl compounds are stabilized by sharing the

     negative charge of the two neighboring carbonyl oxygens. The enolate ion of 2,4-pentanedione, for instance, has

     three resonance forms. Similar resonance forms can be drawn for other doubly stabilized enolate ions.

22.6 Reactivity of Enolate Ions

Enolate ions are more useful than enols for two reasons. First, pure enols can't normally be isolated but are
instead generated only as short-lived intermediates in low concentration. By contrast, stable solutions of pure
enolate ions are easily prepared from most carbonyl compounds by reaction with a strong base. Second, enolate
ions are more reactive than enols and undergo many reactions that enols don't. Whereas enols are neutral,
enolate ions are negatively charged, making them much better nucleophiles.

Because they are resonance hybrids of two nonequivalent forms, enolate ions can be looked at either as vinylic

alkoxides (   ) or as -keto carbanions (  ). Thus, enolate ions can react with electrophiles either

on oxygen or on carbon. Reaction on oxygen yields an enol derivative, while reaction on carbon yields an
-substituted carbonyl compound (FIGURE 22.6). Both kinds of reactivity are known, but reaction on carbon is

more common.

FIGURE 22.6 The electrostatic potential map of acetone enolate ion shows how the negative charge is delocalized over both the oxygen
and the  carbon. As a result, two modes of reaction of an enolate ion with an electrophile E+ are possible. Reaction on carbon to yield an
-substituted carbonyl product is more common.

As an example of enolate ion reactivity, aldehydes and ketones undergo base-promoted  halogenation. Even
relatively weak bases such as hydroxide ion are effective for halogenation because it's not necessary to convert
the ketone completely into its enolate ion. As soon as a small amount of enolate is generated, halogen reacts
with it immediately, removing it from the reaction and driving the equilibrium toward further enolate ion
808  22 · Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions

     formation.

     Base-promoted halogenation of aldehydes and ketones is seldom used in practice because it's difficult to
     stop the reaction at the monosubstituted product. An -halogenated ketone is generally more acidic than the
     starting, unsubstituted ketone because of the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the halogen atom. Thus,
     the monohalogenated products are themselves rapidly turned into enolate ions and further halogenated.

     If excess base and halogen are used, a methyl ketone is triply halogenated and then cleaved by base in the
     haloform reaction. The products are a carboxylic acid plus a so-called haloform (chloroform, CHCl3;
     bromoform, CHBr3; or iodoform, CHI3). Note that the second step of the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl
     substitution of -CX3 by -OH. That is, a halogen-stabilized carbanion acts as a leaving group.

     PROBLEM Why do you suppose ketone halogenations in acidic media are referred to as being acid-catalyzed,
             22-9 whereas halogenations in basic media are base-promoted? In other words, why is a full equivalent
                      of base required for halogenation?

     22.7 Alkylation of Enolate Ions

     Perhaps the most useful reaction of enolate ions is their alkylation by treatment with an alkyl halide, thereby
     forming a new C-C bond and joining two smaller pieces into one larger molecule. Alkylation occurs when the
     nucleophilic enolate ion reacts with the electrophilic alkyl halide in an SN2 reaction and displaces the leaving
     group by backside attack.

     Alkylation reactions are subject to the same constraints that affect all SN2 reactions (Section 11.3). Thus, the
     leaving group X in the alkylating agent R-X can be chloride, bromide, or iodide. The alkyl group R should be
     primary or methyl, and preferably should be allylic or benzylic. Secondary halides react poorly, and tertiary
     halides don't react at all because a competing E2 elimination of HX occurs instead. Vinylic and aryl halides are
     also unreactive because a backside approach is sterically prevented.

     The Malonic Ester Synthesis

     One of the oldest and best known carbonyl alkylation reactions is the malonic ester synthesis, a method for
     preparing a carboxylic acid from an alkyl halide while lengthening the carbon chain by two atoms.

Diethyl propanedioate, commonly called diethyl malonate, or malonic ester, is relatively acidic (pKa = 13)
because its  hydrogens are flanked by two carbonyl groups. Thus, malonic ester is easily converted into its

enolate ion by reaction with sodium ethoxide in ethanol. The enolate ion, in turn, is a good nucleophile that
reacts rapidly with an alkyl halide to give an -substituted malonic ester. Note in the following examples that

the abbreviation "Et" is used for an ethyl group, -CH2CH3.

The product of a malonic ester alkylation has one acidic  hydrogen remaining, so the alkylation process can be
repeated to yield a dialkylated malonic ester.

On heating with aqueous hydrochloric acid, the alkylated (or dialkylated) malonic ester undergoes hydrolysis of
its two ester groups followed by decarboxylation (loss of CO2) to yield a substituted monocarboxylic acid.

Decarboxylation is not a general reaction of carboxylic acids. Rather, it is unique to compounds that have a
second carbonyl group two atoms away from the -CO2H. That is, only substituted malonic acids and -keto acids
undergo loss of CO2 on heating. The decarboxylation reaction occurs by a cyclic mechanism and involves initial
formation of an enol, thereby accounting for the need to have a second carbonyl group appropriately positioned.

As noted previously, the overall effect of malonic ester synthesis is to convert an alkyl halide into a carboxylic
acid while lengthening the carbon chain by two atoms (RX  RCH2CO2H).
810  22 · Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions

     A malonic ester synthesis can also be used to prepare cycloalkanecarboxylic acids. For example, when
     1,4-dibromobutane is treated with diethyl malonate in the presence of two equivalents of sodium ethoxide base,
     the second alkylation step occurs intramolecularly to yield a cyclic product. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation
     then give cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Three-, four-, five-, and six-membered rings can be prepared in this way,
     but yields decrease for larger ring sizes.

      22-12

The Acetoacetic Ester Synthesis

Just as the malonic ester synthesis converts an alkyl halide into a carboxylic acid, the acetoacetic ester
synthesis converts an alkyl halide into a methyl ketone having three more carbons.

Ethyl 3-oxobutanoate, commonly called ethyl acetoacetate, or acetoacetic ester, is much like malonic ester in
that its  hydrogens are flanked by two carbonyl groups. It is therefore readily converted into its enolate ion,
which can be alkylated by reaction with an alkyl halide. A second alkylation can also be carried out if desired,
since acetoacetic ester has two acidic  hydrogens.

On heating with aqueous HCl, the alkylated (or dialkylated) acetoacetic ester is hydrolyzed to a -keto acid,
which then undergoes decarboxylation to yield a ketone product. The decarboxylation occurs in the same way
as in the malonic ester synthesis and involves a ketone enol as the initial product.

The three-step sequence of (1) enolate ion formation, (2) alkylation, and (3) hydrolysis/decarboxylation is
applicable to all -keto esters with acidic  hydrogens, not just to acetoacetic ester itself. For example, cyclic
-keto esters, such as ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate, can be alkylated and decarboxylated to give
2-substituted cyclohexanones.

necessary enolate ions. Alternatively, however, it's also possible in many cases to directly alkylate the  position
of monocarbonyl compounds. A strong, sterically hindered base such as LDA is needed so that complete
conversion to the enolate ion takes place rather than a nucleophilic addition, and a nonprotic solvent must be
used.

Ketones, esters, and nitriles can all be alkylated using LDA or related dialkylamide bases in tetrahydrofuran
(THF). Aldehydes, however, rarely give high yields of pure products because their enolate ions undergo carbonyl
condensation reactions instead of alkylation. (We'll study this condensation reaction in the next chapter.) Some
specific examples of alkylation reactions are shown.
814  22 · Carbonyl Alpha-Substitution Reactions

     Note in the ketone example that alkylation of 2-methylcyclohexanone leads to a mixture of products because
     both possible enolate ions are formed. In general, the major product in such cases occurs by alkylation at
     the less hindered, more accessible position. Thus, alkylation of 2-methylcyclohexanone occurs primarily at C6
     (secondary) rather than C2 (tertiary).

     identify any methyl or primary alkyl groups attached to an  carbon. In the present instance, the target has an
      methyl group, which might be introduced by alkylation of an ester enolate ion with iodomethane.

     Alkylations are rare but not unknown in biological chemistry. One example occurs during biosynthesis of the

Barbiturates

The use of herbal remedies to treat illness and disease goes back thousands of years, but the medical use of
chemicals prepared in the laboratory has a much shorter history. Barbiturates, a large class of drugs with a
wide variety of uses, constitute one of the earliest successes of medicinal chemistry. The synthesis and medical
use of barbiturates goes back to 1904 when Bayer, a German chemical company, first marketed a compound
called barbital, trade named Veronal, as a treatment for insomnia. Since that time, more than 2500 different
barbiturate analogs have been synthesized by drug companies, more than 50 have been used medicinally, and
about a dozen are still in use as anesthetics, anticonvulsants, sedatives, and anxiolytics.

FIGURE 22.8 Different barbiturates come in a multitude of colors, giving rise to similarly colorful street names when the drugs are
abused. (credit: "Medications" by freestocks.org/Flickr, Public Domain)

The synthesis of barbiturates is relatively simple and relies on reactions that are now familiar: enolate

alkylations and nucleophilic acyl substitutions. Starting with diethyl malonate, alkylation of the corresponding

enolate ion with simple alkyl halides provides a wealth of different disubstituted malonic esters. Reaction with

urea,  , then gives the product barbiturates by a twofold nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of

the ester groups with the -NH2 groups of urea (FIGURE 22.9). Amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal),

and secobarbital (Seconal) are typical examples.

FIGURE 22.9 The synthesis of barbiturates relies on malonic ester alkylations and nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions. More than

In addition to their prescribed medical uses, many barbiturates have also found widespread illegal use as street
drugs. Each barbiturate often comes as a tablet of regulated size, shape, and color. Although still used today,
most barbiturates have been replaced by safer, more potent alternatives with markedly different structures.

Summary

The -substitution reaction of a carbonyl compound through either an enol or enolate ion intermediate is one
of the four fundamental reaction types in carbonyl-group chemistry.
818 22 · Summary of Reactions

Carbonyl compounds are in an equilibrium with their enols, a process called keto-enol tautomerism. Although
enol tautomers are normally present to only a small extent at equilibrium and can't usually be isolated in
pure form, they nevertheless contain a highly nucleophilic double bond and react with electrophiles in an
-substitution reaction. An example is the  halogenation of ketones on treatment with Cl2, Br2, or I2 in acid
solution. Alpha bromination of carboxylic acids can be similarly accomplished by the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii
(HVZ) reaction, in which an acid is treated with Br2 and PBr3. The -halogenated products can then undergo
base-induced E2 elimination to yield ,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
Alpha hydrogen atoms of carbonyl compounds are weakly acidic and can be removed by strong bases, such
as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), to yield nucleophilic enolate ions. The most useful reaction of enolate
ions is their SN2 alkylation with alkyl halides. The Malonic ester synthesis converts an alkyl halide into
a carboxylic acid with the addition of two carbon atoms (RX  RCH2CO2H). Similarly, the acetoacetic ester
synthesis converts an alkyl halide into a methyl ketone with the addition of three carbon atoms (RX 
RCH2COCH3). In addition, many carbonyl compounds, including ketones, esters, and nitriles, can be directly
alkylated by treatment with LDA and an alkyl halide.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? We'll see later in this chapter and again in Chapter 29 that carbonyl condensation
reactions occur in a large number of metabolic pathways. In fact, almost all classes of
biomolecules--carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and many others--are biosynthesized through
pathways that involve carbonyl condensation reactions. As with the -substitution reaction discussed in the
previous chapter, the great value of carbonyl condensations is that they are one of the few general methods for
forming carbon-carbon bonds, thereby making it possible to build larger molecules from smaller precursors.
In this chapter, we'll see how and why these reactions occur.
We've now studied three of the four general kinds of carbonyl-group reactions and have seen two general
828  23 · Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     kinds of behavior. In nucleophilic addition and nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions, a carbonyl compound
     behaves as an electrophile when an electron-rich reagent adds to it. In -substitution reactions, however, a
     carbonyl compound behaves as a nucleophile when it is converted into its enol or enolate ion. In the carbonyl
     condensation reactions that we'll study in this chapter, the carbonyl compound behaves both as an electrophile
     and as a nucleophile.

     23.1 Carbonyl Condensations: The Aldol Reaction

     Carbonyl condensation reactions take place between two carbonyl partners and involve a combination of
     nucleophilic addition and -substitution steps. One partner is converted into an enolate-ion nucleophile and
     adds to the electrophilic carbonyl group of the second partner. In so doing, the nucleophilic partner undergoes
     an -substitution reaction and the electrophilic partner undergoes a nucleophilic addition. The general
     mechanism of the process is shown in FIGURE 23.2.

FIGURE 23.2 MECHANISM

The general mechanism of a carbonyl condensation reaction. One partner
becomes a nucleophilic donor and adds to the second partner as an electrophilic
acceptor. After protonation, the final product is a -hydroxy carbonyl compound.

Aldehydes and ketones with an  hydrogen atom undergo a base-catalyzed carbonyl condensation reaction
called the aldol reaction. For example, treatment of acetaldehyde with a base such as sodium ethoxide or
sodium hydroxide in a protic solvent leads to rapid and reversible formation of 3-hydroxybutanal, known
commonly as aldol (aldehyde + alcohol), hence the general name of the reaction.

The exact position of the aldol equilibrium depends both on reaction conditions and on substrate structure.
The equilibrium generally favors the condensation product in the case of aldehydes with no  substituent
830  23 · Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     (RCH2CHO) but favors the reactant for disubstituted aldehydes (R2CHCHO) and for most ketones. Steric factors
     are probably responsible for these trends, since increased substitution near the reaction site increases steric
     congestion in the aldol product.

             WORKED EXAMPLE 23.1

     Predicting the Product of an Aldol Reaction

     What is the structure of the aldol product from propanal?

     Strategy
     An aldol reaction combines two molecules of reactant by forming a bond between the  carbon of one partner
     and the carbonyl carbon of the second partner. The product is a -hydroxy aldehyde or ketone, meaning that the
     two oxygen atoms in the product have a 1,3 relationship.

     23.2 Carbonyl Condensations versus Alpha Substitutions

     Two of the four general carbonyl-group reactions--carbonyl condensations and  substitutions--take place
     under basic conditions and involve enolate-ion intermediates. Because the experimental conditions for the two
     reactions are similar, how can we predict which will occur in a given case? When we generate an enolate ion

23.3 · Dehydration of Aldol Products: Synthesis of Enones                                                        831

with the intention of carrying out an  alkylation, how can we be sure that a carbonyl condensation reaction
won't occur instead?

There is no simple answer to this question, but the exact experimental conditions usually have much to
do with the result. Alpha-substitution reactions require a full equivalent of strong base and are normally
carried out so that the carbonyl compound is rapidly and completely converted into its enolate ion at a low
temperature. An electrophile is then added rapidly to ensure that the reactive enolate ion is quenched quickly.
In a ketone alkylation reaction, for instance, we might use 1 equivalent of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in
tetrahydrofuran solution at -78 °C. Rapid and complete generation of the ketone enolate ion would occur, and
no unreacted ketone would remain, meaning that no condensation reaction could take place. We would then
immediately add an alkyl halide to complete the alkylation reaction.

On the other hand, carbonyl condensation reactions require only a catalytic amount of a relatively weak base,
rather than a full equivalent, so that a small amount of enolate ion is generated in the presence of unreacted
carbonyl compound. Once a condensation occurs, the basic catalyst is regenerated. To carry out an aldol
reaction on propanal, for instance, we might dissolve the aldehyde in methanol, add 0.05 equivalent of sodium
methoxide, and then warm the mixture to give the aldol product.

23.3 Dehydration of Aldol Products: Synthesis of Enones

When heated under either acidic or basic conditions, the -hydroxy aldehydes or ketones formed in aldol
reactions can be dehydrated to yield ,-unsaturated products, or conjugated enones (ene + ketone). In fact, it's
this loss of water that gives the carbonyl condensation reaction its name, because water condenses out when an
enone product forms.

Most alcohols are resistant to dehydration by base (Section 17.6) because hydroxide ion is a poor leaving
group, but aldol products dehydrate easily because of their carbonyl group. Under basic conditions, an acidic
 hydrogen is removed, yielding an enolate ion that expels the nearby -OH leaving group in an E1cB reaction
(Section 11.10). Under acidic conditions, an enol is formed, the -OH group is protonated, and water is expelled
in an E1 or E2 reaction.
832  23 · Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     The reaction conditions needed for aldol dehydration are often only a bit more vigorous (slightly higher
     temperature, for instance) than the conditions needed for the aldol formation itself. As a result, conjugated
     enones are usually obtained directly from aldol reactions without isolating the intermediate -hydroxy carbonyl
     compounds.

     Conjugated enones are more stable than nonconjugated enones for the same reason that conjugated dienes are

     more stable than nonconjugated dienes (Section 14.1). Interaction between the  electrons of the  bond

     and the  electrons of the        group leads to a molecular-orbital description for a conjugated enone with an

     interaction of the  electrons over all four atomic centers (FIGURE 23.3).

     FIGURE 23.3 The  bonding molecular orbitals of a conjugated enone (propenal) and a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene) are similar in
     shape and are spread over the entire  system.

     The real value of aldol dehydration is that removal of water from the reaction mixture can be used to drive the
     aldol equilibrium toward the product. Even though the initial aldol step itself may be unfavorable, as it usually
     is for ketones, the subsequent dehydration step nevertheless allows many aldol condensations to be carried out
     in good yield. Cyclohexanone, for example, gives cyclohexylidenecyclohexanone in 92% yield, even though the
     initial equilibrium is unfavorable.

Strategy
In the aldol reaction, H2O is eliminated and a double bond is formed by removing two hydrogens from the
acidic  position of one partner and the carbonyl oxygen from the second partner. The product is thus an
,-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone.

PROBLEM Aldol condensation of 3-methylcyclohexanone leads to a mixture of two enone products, not
        23-4 counting double-bond isomers. Draw them.

23.4 Using Aldol Reactions in Synthesis

The aldol reaction yields either a -hydroxy aldehyde/ketone or an ,-unsaturated aldehyde/ketone,
depending on the experimental conditions. By learning how to work backward, it's possible to predict when the
aldol reaction might be useful in synthesis. Whenever the target molecule contains either a -hydroxy aldehyde/
ketone or a conjugated enone functional group, it might come from an aldol reaction.

We can extend this kind of reasoning even further by imagining that subsequent transformations might be
carried out on the aldol products. For example, a saturated ketone might be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation
of the enone product. A good example can be found in the industrial preparation of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, an
alcohol used in the synthesis of plasticizers for polymers. Although 2-ethyl-1-hexanol bears little resemblance
to an aldol product at first glance, it is in fact prepared commercially from butanal by an aldol reaction.
Working backward, we can reason that 2-ethyl-1-hexanol might come from 2-ethylhexanal by a reduction.
2-Ethylhexanal, in turn, might be prepared by catalytic reduction of 2-ethyl-2-hexenal, which is the aldol
condensation product of butanal. The reactions that follow show the sequence in reverse order.

             23-7

     23.5 Mixed Aldol Reactions

     Until now, we've considered only symmetrical aldol reactions, in which the two carbonyl components have been
     the same. What would happen, though, if an aldol reaction were carried out between two different carbonyl
     partners?
     In general, a mixed aldol reaction between two similar aldehyde or ketone partners leads to a mixture of four
     possible products. For example, base treatment of a mixture of acetaldehyde and propanal gives a complex
     product mixture containing two "symmetrical" aldol products and two "mixed" aldol products. Clearly, such a
     reaction is of no practical value.

     On the other hand, mixed aldol reactions can lead cleanly to a single product if either of two conditions is met:
       · If one of the carbonyl partners contains no  hydrogens (and thus can't form an enolate ion to become a
           donor), but does contain an unhindered carbonyl group (and so is a good acceptor of nucleophiles), then a
           mixed aldol reaction is likely to be successful. This is the case, for instance, when either benzaldehyde or

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                 23.6 · Intramolecular Aldol Reactions                          835

      formaldehyde is used as one of the carbonyl partners.

Neither benzaldehyde nor formaldehyde can form an enolate ion to add to another partner, yet both compounds
have an unhindered carbonyl group. The ketone 2-methylcyclohexanone, for instance, gives the mixed aldol
product on reaction with benzaldehyde.

· If one of the carbonyl partners is much more acidic than the other, and is thus transformed into its enolate
   ion in preference to the other, then a mixed aldol reaction is likely to be successful. Ethyl acetoacetate,
   for instance, is completely converted into its enolate ion in preference to enolate ion formation from
   monocarbonyl partners. Thus, aldol condensations of monoketones with ethyl acetoacetate occur
   preferentially to give the mixed product.

The situation can be summarized by saying that a mixed aldol reaction leads to a mixture of products unless
one of the partners either has no  hydrogens but is a good electrophilic acceptor (such as benzaldehyde) or is

an unusually acidic nucleophilic donor (such as ethyl acetoacetate).

PROBLEM Which of the following compounds can probably be prepared by a mixed aldol reaction? Show the

23-8 reactants you would use in each case.

(a)  (b)                                    (c)

23.6 Intramolecular Aldol Reactions

The aldol reactions we've seen thus far have all been intermolecular, meaning that they have taken place
between two different molecules. When certain dicarbonyl compounds are treated with base, however, an
intramolecular aldol reaction can occur, leading to the formation of a cyclic product. For example, base
treatment of a 1,4-diketone such as 2,5-hexanedione yields a cyclopentenone product, and base treatment of a
1,5-diketone such as 2,6-heptanedione yields a cyclohexenone.
836  23 · Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     The mechanism of intramolecular aldol reactions is similar to that of intermolecular reactions. The only
     difference is that both the nucleophilic carbonyl anion donor and the electrophilic carbonyl acceptor are
     now in the same molecule. One complication, however, is that intramolecular aldol reactions might lead to a
     mixture of products, depending on which enolate ion is formed. For example, 2,5-hexanedione might yield
     either the five-membered-ring product 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone or the three-membered-ring product
     (2-methylcyclopropenyl) ethanone (FIGURE 23.4). In practice, though, only the cyclopentenone is formed.

     FIGURE 23.4 Intramolecular aldol reaction of 2,5-hexanedione yields 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone rather than the alternative
     cyclopropene.

     The selectivity observed in the intramolecular aldol reaction of 2,5-hexanedione is due to the fact that all steps
     in the mechanism are reversible, so an equilibrium is reached. Thus, the relatively strain-free cyclopentenone
     product is considerably more stable than the highly strained cyclopropene alternative. For similar reasons,
     intramolecular aldol reactions of 1,5-diketones lead only to cyclohexenone products rather than to the more
     strained acylcyclobutenes.

23.7 The Claisen Condensation Reaction

Esters, like aldehydes and ketones, are weakly acidic. When an ester with an  hydrogen is treated with 1
equivalent of a base such as sodium ethoxide, a reversible carbonyl condensation reaction occurs to yield a
-keto ester. For instance, ethyl acetate yields ethyl acetoacetate on base treatment. This reaction between two
ester molecules is known as the Claisen condensation reaction. (We'll use ethyl esters, abbreviated "Et," for
consistency, but other esters will also work.)

The mechanism of the Claisen condensation is similar to that of the aldol condensation and involves the
nucleophilic addition of an ester enolate ion to the carbonyl group of a second ester molecule (FIGURE 23.5).
The only difference between the aldol condensation of an aldehyde or ketone and the Claisen condensation
of an ester involves the fate of the initially formed tetrahedral intermediate. The tetrahedral intermediate in
the aldol reaction is protonated to give an alcohol product--exactly the behavior previously seen for aldehydes
and ketones (Section 19.4). The tetrahedral intermediate in the Claisen reaction, however, expels an alkoxide
leaving group to yield an acyl substitution product--as previously seen for esters (Section 21.6).
838  23 · Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     FIGURE 23.5 MECHANISM
     Mechanism of the Claisen condensation reaction.

     If the starting ester has more than one acidic  hydrogen, the product -keto ester has a highly acidic, doubly
     activated hydrogen atom that can be abstracted by base. This deprotonation of the product requires the use
     of a full equivalent of base rather than a catalytic amount. Furthermore, the deprotonation serves to drive the
     equilibrium completely to the product side so that high yields are usually obtained in Claisen condensations.

      23-12 by base into two fragments. Using curved arrows to indicate electron flow, show the mechanism by
                 which this cleavage occurs.

23.8 Mixed Claisen Condensations

The mixed Claisen condensation of two different esters is similar to the mixed aldol condensation of two
different aldehydes or ketones (Section 23.5). Mixed Claisen reactions are successful only when one of the two
ester components has no  hydrogens and thus can't form an enolate ion. For example, ethyl benzoate and
ethyl formate can't form enolate ions and thus can't serve as donors. They can, however, act as the electrophilic
acceptor components in reactions with other ester anions to give mixed -keto ester products.

Mixed Claisen-like reactions can also be carried out between an ester and a ketone, resulting in the synthesis of
a -diketone. The reaction works best when the ester component has no  hydrogens and thus can't act as the

nucleophilic donor. For example, ethyl formate gives high yields in mixed Claisen condensations with ketones.

     condensations can be carried out with diketones (Section 23.6). Called the Dieckmann cyclization, this
     reaction works best on 1,6-diesters and 1,7-diesters. Intramolecular Claisen cyclization of a 1,6-diester gives a
     five-membered cyclic -keto ester, and cyclization of a 1,7-diester gives a six-membered cyclic -keto ester.

The mechanism of the Dieckmann cyclization, shown in FIGURE 23.6, is the same as that of the Claisen
condensation. One of the two ester groups is converted into an enolate ion, which carries out a nucleophilic acyl
substitution on the second ester group at the other end of the molecule. A cyclic -keto ester product results.

     23.10 Conjugate Carbonyl Additions: The Michael Reaction

     We saw in Section 19.13 that certain nucleophiles, such as amines, react with ,-unsaturated aldehydes and
     ketones to give a conjugate addition product, rather than a direct addition product.

     Exactly the same kind of conjugate addition can occur when a nucleophilic enolate ion reacts with an
     ,-unsaturated carbonyl compound--a process known as the Michael reaction after Arthur Michael at Tufts
     College and Harvard University.
     The best Michael reactions are those that take place when a particularly stable enolate ion, such as that derived
     from a -keto ester or other 1,3-dicarbonyl compound, adds to an unhindered ,-unsaturated ketone. For
     example, ethyl acetoacetate reacts with 3-buten-2-one in the presence of sodium ethoxide to yield the conjugate
     addition product.

The Michael reaction occurs with a variety of ,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, not just conjugated
ketones. Unsaturated aldehydes, esters, thioesters, nitriles, amides, and nitro compounds can all act as the
electrophilic acceptor component in Michael reactions (TABLE 23.1). Similarly, a variety of different donors can
be used, including -diketones, -keto esters, malonic esters, -keto nitriles, and nitro compounds.

23.11 Carbonyl Condensations with Enamines: The Stork Enamine Reaction

In addition to enolate ions, other kinds of carbon nucleophiles also add to ,-unsaturated acceptors in Michael-
like reactions. Among the most important and useful of such nucleophiles, particularly in biological chemistry,
are enamines, which are readily prepared by reaction between a ketone and a secondary amine (Section 19.8).
For example:

As the following resonance structures indicate, enamines are electronically similar to enolate ions. Overlap of
the nitrogen lone-pair orbital with the double-bond p orbitals leads to an increase in electron density on the 
carbon atom, making that carbon nucleophilic. An electrostatic potential map of N,N-dimethylaminoethylene
shows this shift of electron density (red) toward the  position.

Enamines behave in much the same way as enolate ions and enter into many of the same kinds of reactions.
In the Stork enamine reaction, named for its discoverer, Gilbert Stork of Columbia University, for example,
an enamine adds to an ,-unsaturated carbonyl acceptor in a Michael-like process. The initial product is
then hydrolyzed by aqueous acid to yield a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound. The overall reaction is thus a three-
step sequence of (1) enamine formation from a ketone, (2) Michael addition to an ,-unsaturated carbonyl
compound, and (3) enamine hydrolysis back to a ketone.

The net effect of the Stork enamine reaction is the Michael addition of a ketone to an ,-unsaturated carbonyl
compound. For example, cyclohexanone reacts with the cyclic amine pyrrolidine to yield an enamine; further
reaction with an enone such as 3-buten-2-one yields a Michael adduct; and aqueous hydrolysis completes the
sequence to give a 1,5-diketone (FIGURE 23.8).

     enamine, (2) the enamine adds to the ,-unsaturated ketone in a Michael reaction, and (3) the conjugate addition product is hydrolyzed to
     yield a 1,5-diketone.

     The enamine-Michael reaction has two advantages over the enolate-ion-Michael reaction that makes it
     particularly useful in biological pathways. First, an enamine is neutral, easily prepared, and easily handled,
     while an enolate ion is charged, sometimes difficult to prepare, and must be handled carefully. Second, an
     enamine from a monoketone can be used in the Michael addition, whereas only enolate ions from -dicarbonyl
     compounds can be used.

23.12 The Robinson Annulation Reaction

Carbonyl condensation reactions are perhaps the most versatile methods available for synthesizing complex
molecules. By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful
transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis
of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning "ring," so an annulation
reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.

Named after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a
two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between
a nucleophilic donor, such as a -keto ester; an enamine, or a -diketone; and an ,-unsaturated ketone
acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2-cyclohexenone.

The first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a
-keto ester or -diketone effects a conjugate addition to an ,-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5-diketone. But
as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones
when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been
accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).

  FIGURE 23.9 Synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone using a Robinson annulation reaction. The nucleophilic donor is a -diketone.

In this example, the -diketone 2-methyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione is used to generate the enolate ion required
for Michael reaction and an aryl-substituted ,-unsaturated ketone is used as the acceptor. Base-catalyzed
Michael reaction between the two partners yields an intermediate triketone, which then cyclizes in an
intramolecular aldol condensation to give a Robinson annulation product. Several further transformations are
required to complete the synthesis of estrone.

     23.13 Some Biological Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     Biological Aldol Reactions

     Aldol reactions occur in many biological pathways but are particularly common in carbohydrate metabolism,
     where enzymes called aldolases catalyze the addition of a ketone enolate ion to an aldehyde. Aldolases occur
     in all organisms and are of two types. Type I aldolases occur primarily in animals and higher plants; type
     II aldolases occur primarily in fungi and bacteria. Both types catalyze the same kind of reaction, but type I
     aldolases operate through an enamine while type II aldolases require a metal ion (usually Zn2+) as a Lewis acid
     and operate through an enolate ion.
     An example of an aldolase-catalyzed reaction occurs in glucose biosynthesis when dihydroxyacetone phosphate
     reacts with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to give fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In animals and higher plants,
     dihydroxyacetone phosphate is first converted into an enamine by reaction with the -NH2 group on a lysine
     amino acid in the enzyme. The enamine then adds to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and the iminium ion that
     results is hydrolyzed. In bacteria and fungi, the aldol reaction occurs directly, with the ketone carbonyl group of
     glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate complexed to a Zn2+ ion to make it a better acceptor.

Note that the aldolase-catalyzed reactions are mixed aldol reactions, which take place between two different
partners, as opposed to the symmetrical aldol reactions between identical partners usually carried out in the
laboratory. Mixed aldol reactions often give mixtures of products in the laboratory but are successful in living
systems because of the selectivity of the enzyme catalysts.

Biological Claisen Condensations

Claisen condensations, like aldol reactions, also occur in a large number of biological pathways. In fatty-acid
biosynthesis, for instance, an enolate ion generated by decarboxylation (Section 22.7) of malonyl ACP adds
to the carbonyl group of another acyl group bonded through a thioester linkage to a synthase enzyme. The
tetrahedral intermediate that results then expels the synthase, giving acetoacetyl ACP. (The abbreviation ACP
stands for acyl carrier protein, which forms thioester bonds to acyl groups.)
850  23 · Carbonyl Condensation Reactions

     Mixed Claisen condensations also occur frequently in living organisms, particularly in the pathway for fatty-
     acid biosynthesis that we'll discuss in Section 29.4. Butyryl synthase, for instance, reacts with malonyl ACP in a
     mixed Claisen condensation to give 3-ketohexanoyl ACP.

A Prologue to Metabolism

Biochemistry is carbonyl chemistry. Almost all metabolic pathways used by living organisms involve one or
more of the four fundamental carbonyl-group reactions we've seen in the chapters on Aldehydes and Ketones:
Nucleophilic Addition Reactions through Carbonyl Condensation Reactions. The digestion and metabolic
breakdown of all the major classes of food molecules--fats, carbohydrates, and proteins--take place by
nucleophilic addition reactions, nucleophilic acyl substitutions,  substitutions, and carbonyl condensations.
Similarly, hormones and other crucial biological molecules are built up from smaller precursors by these same
carbonyl-group reactions.

FIGURE 23.10 You are what you eat. Food molecules are metabolized by pathways that involve the four major carbonyl-group
reactions. (credit: "Spring" by Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Louvre Museum/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Take glycolysis, for example, the metabolic pathway by which organisms convert glucose to pyruvate as the first
step in extracting energy from carbohydrates.

Glycolysis is a ten-step process that begins with isomerization of glucose from its cyclic hemiacetal form to
its open-chain aldehyde form--the reverse of a nucleophilic addition reaction. The aldehyde then undergoes
tautomerization to yield an enol, which undergoes yet another tautomerization to give the ketone fructose.
852 23 · Key Terms

Fructose, a -hydroxy ketone, is then cleaved by a retro-aldol reaction into two three-carbon molecules--one
ketone and one aldehyde. Further carbonyl-group reactions then occur until pyruvate is formed.

These few examples are only an introduction; we'll look at several of the major metabolic pathways in more
detail in Chapter 29. The bottom line, however, is that you haven't seen the end of carbonyl-group chemistry if
you have any interest in biological or medical fields. A solid grasp of carbonyl-group reactions is crucial to an
understanding of biochemistry.

Summary

In this chapter, we've discussed the fourth and last of the common carbonyl-group reactions--the carbonyl

condensation. A carbonyl condensation reaction takes place between two carbonyl partners and involves
both nucleophilic addition and -substitution processes. One carbonyl partner is converted by base into a

nucleophilic enolate ion, which then adds to the electrophilic carbonyl group of the second partner. The first
partner thus undergoes an  substitution, while the second undergoes a nucleophilic addition.

The aldol reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two aldehyde or ketone molecules. Aldol
reactions are reversible, leading first to -hydroxy aldehydes/ketones and then to ,-unsaturated products
after dehydration. Mixed aldol condensations between two different aldehydes or ketones generally give a
mixture of all four possible products. A mixed reaction can be successful, however, if one of the two partners is
an unusually good donor (ethyl acetoacetate, for instance) or if it can act only as an acceptor (formaldehyde and
benzaldehyde, for instance). Intramolecular aldol condensations of 1,4- and 1,5-diketones are also successful
and provide a good way to make five- and six-membered rings.

The Claisen condensation reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two ester components
and gives a -keto ester product. Mixed Claisen condensations between two different esters are successful
only when one of the two partners has no acidic  hydrogens (ethyl benzoate and ethyl formate, for instance)
and thus can function only as the acceptor partner. Intramolecular Claisen condensations, called Dieckmann
cyclization reactions, yield five- and six-membered cyclic -keto esters starting from 1,6- and 1,7-diesters.
The conjugate addition of a carbon nucleophile to an ,-unsaturated acceptor is known as the Michael
reaction. The best Michael reactions take place between relatively acidic donors (-keto esters or -diketones)
and unhindered ,-unsaturated acceptors. Enamines, prepared by reaction of a ketone with a disubstituted
amine, are also good Michael donors in the Stork enamine reaction.
Carbonyl condensation reactions are widely used in synthesis. One example of their versatility is the Robinson
annulation reaction, which leads to the formation of a substituted cyclohexenone. Treatment of a -diketone
or -keto ester with an ,-unsaturated ketone leads first to a Michael addition, which is followed by
intramolecular aldol cyclization. Condensation reactions are also used widely in nature for the biosynthesis of
such molecules as fats and steroids.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? By the end of this chapter, we will have seen all the common functional groups. Of those
groups, carbonyl compounds and amines are the most abundant and have the richest chemistry. In addition to
proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many
of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.
Amines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of
water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic
and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this
lone pair of electrons.
Amines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is
partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant
found in the leaves of the South American coca bush. In addition, amino acids are the building blocks from
864  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     which all proteins are made, and cyclic amine bases are constituents of nucleic acids.

     24.1 Naming Amines

     Amines can be either alkyl-substituted (alkylamines) or aryl-substituted (arylamines). Although much of the
     chemistry of the two classes is similar, there are also substantial differences. Amines are classified as primary
     (RNH2), secondary (R2NH), or tertiary (R3N), depending on the number of organic substituents attached to
     nitrogen. Thus, methylamine (CH3NH2) is a primary amine, dimethylamine [(CH3)2NH] is a secondary amine,
     and trimethylamine [(CH3)3N] is a tertiary amine. Note that this usage of the terms primary, secondary, and
     tertiary differs from our previous usage. When we speak of a tertiary alcohol or alkyl halide, we refer to the
     degree of substitution at the alkyl carbon atom, but when we speak of a tertiary amine, we refer to the degree of
     substitution at the nitrogen atom.

     Compounds containing a nitrogen atom with four attached groups also exist, but the nitrogen atom must carry
     a formal positive charge. Such compounds are called quaternary ammonium salts.

     Primary amines are named in the IUPAC system in several ways. For simple amines, the suffix -amine is added
     to the name of the alkyl substituent. You might also recall from the chapter on Benzene and Aromaticity that the
     aromatic phenylamine, H2N-C6H5, has the common name aniline.

     Alternatively, the suffix -amine can be used in place of the final -e in the name of the parent compound.

     Amines with more than one functional group are named by considering the -NH2 as an amino substituent on
     the parent molecule.

Symmetrical secondary and tertiary amines are named by adding the prefix di- or tri- to the alkyl group.

Unsymmetrically substituted secondary and tertiary amines are referred to as N-substituted primary amines.
The largest alkyl group takes the parent name, and the other alkyl groups are considered N-substituents on the
parent (N because they're attached to nitrogen).

Heterocyclic amines--compounds in which the nitrogen atom occurs as part of a ring--are also common, and
each different heterocyclic ring system has its own parent name. The heterocyclic nitrogen atom is always
numbered as position 1.

     24.2 Structure and Properties of Amines

     The bonding in alkylamines is similar to the bonding in ammonia. The nitrogen atom is sp3-hybridized, with
     its three substituents occupying three corners of a regular tetrahedron and the lone pair of electrons occupying
     the fourth corner. As you might expect, the C-N-C bond angles are close to the 109° tetrahedral value. For
     trimethylamine, the C-N-C bond angle is 108° and the C-N bond length is 147 pm.

     One consequence of tetrahedral geometry is that an amine with three different substituents on nitrogen is
     chiral, as we saw in Section 5.10. Unlike chiral carbon compounds, however, chiral amines can't usually be
     resolved because the two enantiomeric forms rapidly interconvert by a pyramidal inversion, much as an
     alkyl halide inverts in an SN2 reaction. Pyramidal inversion occurs by a momentary rehybridization of the
     nitrogen atom to planar, sp2 geometry, followed by rehybridization of the planar intermediate to tetrahedral,
     sp3 geometry (FIGURE 24.2). The barrier to inversion is about 25 kJ/mol (6 kcal/mol), an amount only twice as
     large as the barrier to rotation about a C-C single bond.

                    FIGURE 24.2 Pyramidal inversion rapidly interconverts the two mirror-image (enantiomeric) forms of an amine.

     Alkylamines have a variety of applications in the chemical industry as starting materials for the preparation of
     insecticides and pharmaceuticals. Labetalol, for instance, a so-called -blocker used for the treatment of high
     blood pressure, is prepared by SN2 reaction of an epoxide with a primary amine. The substance marketed for
     drug use is a mixture of all four possible stereoisomers, but the biological activity results primarily from the
     (R,R) isomer.

Like alcohols, amines with fewer than five carbon atoms are generally water-soluble. Also like alcohols, primary
and secondary amines form hydrogen bonds and are highly associated. As a result, amines have higher boiling
points than alkanes of similar molecular weight. Diethylamine (MW = 73 amu) boils at 56.3 °C, for instance,
while pentane (MW = 72 amu) boils at 36.1 °C.

                                                                FIGURE 24.3 Hydrogen bonding in amines.

One other characteristic of amines is their odor. Low-molecular-weight amines such as trimethylamine have
a distinctive fishlike aroma, while diamines such as cadaverine (1,5-pentanediamine) and putrescine
(1,4-butanediamine) have the appalling odors you might expect from their common names. Both of these
diamines arise from the decomposition of decaying tissue.

24.3 Basicity of Amines

The chemistry of amines is dominated by the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen, which makes amines both basic
and nucleophilic. They react with acids to form acid-base salts, and they react with electrophiles in many of the
polar reactions seen in past chapters. Note in the following electrostatic potential map of trimethylamine how
the negative (red) region corresponds to the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen.

Amines are much stronger bases than alcohols and ethers, their oxygen-containing analogs. When an amine is
dissolved in water, an equilibrium is established in which water acts as an acid and transfers a proton to the
amine. Just as the acid strength of a carboxylic acid can be measured by defining an acidity constant Ka (Section
2.8), the base strength of an amine can be measured by defining an analogous basicity constant Kb. The larger
the value of Kb and the smaller the value of pKb, the more favorable the proton-transfer equilibrium and the
stronger the base.
868  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     For the reaction

     In practice, Kb values are not often used. Instead, the most convenient way to measure the basicity of an amine
     (RNH2) is to look at the acidity of the corresponding ammonium ion (RNH3+).
     For the reaction

     so

     Thus                                                   
     and

     These equations say that the Kb of an amine multiplied by the Ka of the corresponding ammonium ion is equal
     to Kw, the ion-product constant for water (1.00 × 10-14). Thus, if we know Ka for an ammonium ion, we also
     know Kb for the corresponding amine base because Kb = Kw/Ka. The more acidic the ammonium ion, the less
     tightly the proton is held and the weaker the corresponding base. That is, a weaker base has an ammonium ion

     with a smaller pKa and a stronger base has an ammonium ion with a larger pKa.

     Weaker base       Smaller pKa for ammonium ion
     Stronger base     Larger pKa for ammonium ion

     TABLE 24.1 lists pKa values of the ammonium ions from a variety of amines and indicates that there is a
     substantial range of amine basicities. Most simple alkylamines are similar in their base strength, with pKa's
     for their ammonium ions in the narrow range 10 to 11. Arylamines, however, are considerably less basic than

     alkylamines, as are the heterocyclic amines pyridine and pyrrole.

In contrast with amines, amides (RCONH2) are nonbasic. Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and
they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is
that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with
the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they
are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is
protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced
electron density on the amide nitrogen.
870  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     To purify amines, it's often possible to take advantage of their basicity. For example, if a mixture of a basic amine
     and a neutral compound such as a ketone or alcohol is dissolved in an organic solvent and aqueous acid is
     added, the basic amine dissolves in the water layer as its protonated salt, while the neutral compound remains
     in the organic solvent layer. Separation of the water layer and neutralization of the ammonium ion by addition
     of NaOH then provides the pure amine (FIGURE 24.4).

         FIGURE 24.4 Separation and purification of an amine component from a mixture by extraction of its ammonium salt into water.

     In addition to their behavior as bases, primary and secondary amines can also act as very weak acids because
     an N-H proton can be removed by a sufficiently strong base. We've seen, for example, how diisopropylamine
     (pKa  36) reacts with butyllithium to yield lithium diisopropylamide (LDA; Section 22.5). Dialkylamine anions
     like LDA are very strong bases that are often used in laboratory organic chemistry for the generation of enolate
     ions from carbonyl compounds (Section 22.7). They are not, however, encountered in biological chemistry.

                      and propylamine?

     24.4 Basicity of Arylamines

     As noted previously, arylamines are generally less basic than alkylamines. Anilinium ion has pKa = 4.63, for
     instance, whereas methylammonium ion has pKa = 10.64. Arylamines are less basic than alkylamines because
     the nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized by interaction with the aromatic ring's  electron system and
     are less available for bonding to H+. In resonance terms, arylamines are stabilized relative to alkylamines

because of their five resonance forms.

Much of the resonance stabilization is lost on protonation, however, so the energy difference between
protonated and nonprotonated forms is higher for arylamines than it is for alkylamines. As a result, arylamines
are less basic. FIGURE 24.5 illustrates this difference.

FIGURE 24.5 Arylamines have a larger positive G° for protonation and are therefore less basic than alkylamines, primarily because
of resonance stabilization of the ground state. Electrostatic potential maps show that lone-pair electron density is delocalized in the amine
but the charge is localized in the corresponding ammonium ion.

Substituted arylamines can be either more basic or less basic than aniline, depending on the substituent.
Electron-donating substituents, such as -CH3, -NH2, and -OCH3, which increase the reactivity of an aromatic
ring toward electrophilic substitution (Section 16.4), also increase the basicity of the corresponding arylamine.
Electron-withdrawing substituents, such as -Cl, -NO2, and -CN, which decrease ring reactivity toward
electrophilic substitution, also decrease arylamine basicity. TABLE 24.2 considers only p-substituted anilines,
but similar trends are observed for ortho and meta derivatives.

     24.5 Biological Amines and the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

     We saw in Section 20.3 that the extent of dissociation of a carboxylic acid HA in an aqueous solution buffered to

     a given pH can be calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Furthermore, we concluded that at the

     physiological pH of 7.3 inside living cells, carboxylic acids are almost entirely dissociated into their carboxylate
     anions, RCO2-.

     Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

                                                      

     What about amine bases? In what form do they exist at physiological pH? As the amine (A- = RNH2), or as
     the ammonium ion (HA = RNH3+)? Let's take a 0.0010 M solution of methylamine at pH = 7.3, for example.
     According to TABLE 24.1, the pKa of methylammonium ion is 10.64, so from the Henderson-Hasselbalch
     equation, we have

                                                      

     In addition, we know that

     Solving the two simultaneous equations gives [RNH3+] = 0.0010 M and [RNH2] = 5 × 10-7 M. In other words, at
     a physiological pH of 7.3, essentially 100% of the methylamine in a 0.0010 M solution exists in its protonated
     form as methylammonium ion. The same is true of other amine bases, so we always write cellular amines

24.6 Synthesis of Amines

Reduction of Nitriles, Amides, and Nitro Compounds

We've already seen in Section 20.7 and Section 21.7 how amines can be prepared by reduction of nitriles
and amides with LiAlH4. The two-step sequence of SN2 displacement with CN- followed by reduction thus
converts an alkyl halide into a primary alkylamine having an additional carbon atom. Amide reduction converts
carboxylic acids and their derivatives into amines with the same number of carbon atoms.

Arylamines are usually prepared by nitration of an aromatic starting material, followed by reduction of the

nitro group (Section 16.2). The reduction step can be carried out in many different ways, depending on the

circumstances. Catalytic hydrogenation over platinum works well but is often incompatible with the presence

elsewhere in the molecule of other reducible groups, such as  bonds or carbonyl groups. Iron, zinc, tin, and

tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) are also effective when used in acidic aqueous solution. Tin(II) chloride is particularly

mild and is often used when other reducible functional groups are present.

     SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Halides

     Ammonia and other amines are good nucleophiles in SN2 reactions. As a result, the simplest method of
     alkylamine synthesis is by SN2 alkylation of ammonia or an alkylamine with an alkyl halide. If ammonia is used,
     a primary amine results; if a primary amine is used, a secondary amine results; and so on. Even tertiary amines
     react rapidly with alkyl halides to yield quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+ X-.

     Unfortunately, these reactions don't stop cleanly after a single alkylation has occurred. Because ammonia
     and primary amines have similar reactivity, the initially formed monoalkylated substance often undergoes
     further reaction to yield a mixture of products. Even secondary and tertiary amines undergo further alkylation,
     although to a lesser extent. For example, treatment of 1-bromooctane with a twofold excess of ammonia leads
     to a mixture containing only 45% octylamine. A nearly equal amount of dioctylamine is produced by double
     alkylation, along with smaller amounts of trioctylamine and tetraoctylammonium bromide.

     A better method for preparing primary amines is to use azide ion, N3-, rather than ammonia, as the nucleophile
     for SN2 reaction with a primary or secondary alkyl halide. The product is an alkyl azide, which is not
     nucleophilic, so overalkylation can't occur. Subsequent reduction of the alkyl azide with LiAlH4 then leads to the
     desired primary amine. Although this method works well, low-molecular-weight alkyl azides are explosive and
     must be handled carefully.

     Another alternative for preparing a primary amine from an alkyl halide is the Gabriel amine synthesis, which

     uses a phthalimide alkylation. An imide (      ) is similar to a -keto ester in that the acidic N-H

     hydrogen is flanked by two carbonyl groups. Thus, imides are deprotonated by such bases as KOH, and the

     resultant anions are readily alkylated in a reaction similar to acetoacetic ester synthesis (Section 22.7). Basic

     hydrolysis of the N-alkylated imide then yields a primary amine product. The imide hydrolysis step is analogous

     to the hydrolysis of an amide (Section 21.7).

Reductive Amination of Aldehydes and Ketones

Amines can be synthesized in a single step by treatment of an aldehyde or ketone with ammonia or an amine
in the presence of a reducing agent, a process called reductive amination. For example, amphetamine, a
central nervous system stimulant, is prepared commercially by reductive amination of phenyl-2-propanone
with ammonia using hydrogen gas over a nickel catalyst as the reducing agent. In the laboratory, either NaBH4
or the related NaBH(OAc)3 is commonly used (OAc = acetate).

Reductive amination takes place by the pathway shown in FIGURE 24.6. An imine intermediate is first formed

by a nucleophilic addition reaction (Section 19.8), and the  bond of the imine is then reduced to the amine,

much as the  bond of a ketone can be reduced to an alcohol.

     Reductive aminations also occur in various biological pathways. In the biosynthesis of the amino acid proline,

     for instance, glutamate 5-semialdehyde undergoes internal imine formation to give 1-pyrrolinium

     5-carboxylate, which is then reduced by nucleophilic addition of hydride ion to the  bond. Reduced

     nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NADH, acts as the biological reducing agent.

Hofmann and Curtius Rearrangements

Carboxylic acid derivatives can be converted into primary amines with loss of one carbon atom by both the
Hofmann rearrangement and the Curtius rearrangement. Although the Hofmann rearrangement involves
a primary amide and the Curtius rearrangement involves an acyl azide, both proceed through similar
mechanisms.
878  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     Hofmann rearrangement occurs when a primary amide, RCONH2, is treated with Br2 and base (FIGURE 24.7).
     The overall mechanism is lengthy, but most of the individual steps have been encountered before. Thus, the
     bromination of an amide in steps 1 and 2 is analogous to the base-promoted bromination of a ketone enolate
     ion (Section 22.6), and the rearrangement of the bromoamide anion in step 4 is analogous to a carbocation
     rearrangement (Section 7.11). Nucleophilic addition of water to the isocyanate carbonyl group in step 5 is a
     typical carbonyl-group process (Section 19.4), as is the final decarboxylation step 6 (Section 22.7).

     alkylamines. For example, the appetite-suppressant drug phentermine is prepared commercially by Hofmann
     rearrangement of a primary amide. Commonly known by the name Fen-Phen, the combination of phentermine
     with another appetite-suppressant, fenfluramine, is suspected of causing heart damage.

     The Curtius rearrangement, like the Hofmann rearrangement, involves migration of an -R group from the
     carbon atom to the neighboring nitrogen with simultaneous loss of a leaving group. The reaction takes place on
     heating an acyl azide that is itself prepared by nucleophilic acyl substitution of an acid chloride.

     Also like the Hofmann rearrangement, the Curtius rearrangement is often used commercially. The
     antidepressant drug tranylcypromine, for instance, is made by Curtius rearrangement of
     2-phenylcyclopropanecarbonyl chloride.

24.7 Reactions of Amines

Alkylation and Acylation

We've already studied the two most general reactions of amines--alkylation and acylation. As we saw earlier in
this chapter, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines can be alkylated by reaction with a primary alkyl halide.
Alkylations of primary and secondary amines are difficult to control and often give mixtures of products, but
tertiary amines are cleanly alkylated to give quaternary ammonium salts. Primary and secondary (but not
tertiary) amines can also be acylated by nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction with an acid chloride or an acid
anhydride to yield an amide (Section 21.4 and Section 21.5). Note that overacylation of the nitrogen does not
occur because the amide product is much less nucleophilic and less reactive than the starting amine.

Hofmann Elimination Reaction

Like alcohols, amines can be converted into alkenes by an elimination reaction. But because an amide ion,
NH2-, is such a poor leaving group, it must first be converted into a better leaving group. In the Hofmann
elimination reaction, an amine is completely methylated by reaction with an excess amount of iodomethane
to produce the corresponding quaternary ammonium salt. This salt then undergoes elimination to give an
alkene on heating with a base, typically silver oxide, Ag2O. For example, 1-methylpentylamine is converted into
1-hexene.

Silver oxide acts by exchanging iodide ion for hydroxide ion in the quaternary salt, thus providing the base
necessary for elimination. The actual elimination step is an E2 reaction (Section 11.8) in which hydroxide ion
removes a proton while the positively charged nitrogen atom leaves.
882  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     Unlike what happens in other E2 reactions, the major product of Hofmann elimination is the less highly
     substituted alkene rather than the more highly substituted one, as shown by the reaction of
     (1-methylbutyl)trimethylammonium hydroxide to give 1-pentene rather than the alternative 2-pentene. The
     reason for this non-Zaitsev result is probably steric. Because of the large size of the trialkylamine leaving group,
     the base must abstract a hydrogen from the more accessible, least hindered position.

     The Hofmann elimination reaction is not often currently used in the laboratory, but analogous biological
     eliminations occur frequently, although usually with protonated ammonium ions rather than quaternary
     ammonium salts. In the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, for instance, a substance called adenylosuccinate
     undergoes an elimination of a positively charged nitrogen to give fumarate plus adenosine monophosphate.

regiochemistry to form the less highly substituted double bond. To predict the product, look at the reactant
and identify the positions from which elimination might occur (the positions two carbons away from nitrogen).
Then, carry out an elimination using the most accessible hydrogen. In the present instance, there are three
possible positions from which elimination might occur--one primary, one secondary, and one tertiary. The
primary position is the most accessible and leads to the least highly substituted alkene, ethylene.

24.8 Reactions of Arylamines

Electrophilic Aromatic Substitutions

An amino group is strongly activating and ortho- and para-directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution
reactions (Section 16.4). This high reactivity of amino-substituted benzenes can be a drawback at times
because it's often difficult to prevent polysubstitution. Reaction of aniline with Br2, for instance, takes place
rapidly and yields the 2,4,6-tribrominated product. The amino group is so strongly activating that it's not
possible to stop at the monobromo stage.
884  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     Another drawback to the use of amino-substituted benzenes in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is
     that Friedel-Crafts reactions are not successful (Section 16.3). The amino group forms an acid-base complex
     with the AlCl3 catalyst, which prevents further reaction. Both drawbacks can be overcome, however, by carrying
     out electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on the corresponding amide rather than on the free amine.

     As we saw in Section 21.5, treatment of an amine with acetic anhydride yields the corresponding acetyl amide,

     or acetamide. Although still activating and ortho-, para-directing, amido substituents (  ) are less

     strongly activating and less basic than amino groups because their nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized

     by the neighboring carbonyl group. As a result, bromination of an N-arylamide occurs cleanly to give a

     monobromo product, and hydrolysis of the amide with aqueous base then gives the free amine. For example,

     p-toluidine (4-methylaniline) can be acetylated, brominated, and hydrolyzed to yield 2-bromo-4-methylaniline.

     None of the 2,6-dibrominated product is obtained.

     Friedel-Crafts alkylations and acylations of N-arylamides also proceed normally. For example, benzoylation of
     acetanilide (N-acetylaniline) under Friedel-Crafts conditions gives 4-aminobenzophenone in 80% yield after
     hydrolysis.

     Moderating the reactivity of an amino-substituted benzene by forming an amide is a useful trick that allows
     many kinds of electrophilic aromatic substitutions to be carried out that would otherwise be impossible. One
     example is the preparation of the sulfa drugs, such as sulfanilamide.
     Sulfa drugs were among the first pharmaceutical agents to be used clinically against bacterial infection.
     Although they have largely been replaced today by safer and more powerful antibiotics, sulfa drugs are credited
     with saving the lives of thousands of wounded during World War II and are still prescribed for urinary tract
     infections. They are prepared by chlorosulfonation of acetanilide, followed by reaction of

Diazonium Salts: The Sandmeyer Reaction

Primary arylamines react with nitrous acid, HNO2, to yield stable arenediazonium salts,      , a process

called a diazotization reaction. Alkylamines also react with nitrous acid, but the corresponding

alkanediazonium products are so reactive they can't be isolated. Instead, they lose nitrogen instantly to yield

carbocations. The analogous loss of N2 from an arenediazonium ion to yield an aryl cation is disfavored by the

instability of the cation.

Arenediazonium salts are useful because the diazonio group (  ) can be replaced by a nucleophile in a
substitution reaction.

Many different nucleophiles--halide, hydride, cyanide, and hydroxide among others--react with
arenediazonium salts, yielding many different kinds of substituted benzenes. The overall sequence of (1)
nitration, (2) reduction, (3) diazotization, and (4) nucleophilic substitution is perhaps the single most versatile
method of aromatic substitution.

Aryl chlorides and bromides are prepared by reaction of an arenediazonium salt with the corresponding
copper(I) halide, CuX, a process called the Sandmeyer reaction. Aryl iodides can be prepared by direct reaction
886  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     with NaI without using a copper(I) salt. Yields generally fall between 60% and 80%.

     Similar treatment of an arenediazonium salt with CuCN yields the nitrile ArCN, which can then be further
     converted into other functional groups such as carboxyl. For example, Sandmeyer reaction of
     o-methylbenzenediazonium bisulfate with CuCN yields o-methylbenzonitrile, which can be hydrolyzed to give
     o-methylbenzoic acid. This product can't be prepared from o-xylene by the usual side-chain oxidation route
     because both methyl groups would be oxidized.

     The diazonio group can also be replaced by -OH to yield a phenol and by -H to yield an arene. A phenol
     is prepared by reaction of the arenediazonium salt with copper(I) oxide in an aqueous solution of copper(II)
     nitrate, a reaction that is especially useful because few other general methods exist for introducing an -OH
     group onto an aromatic ring.

     Reduction of a diazonium salt to give an arene occurs on treatment with hypophosphorous acid, H3PO2. This
     reaction is used primarily when there is a need for temporarily introducing an amino substituent onto a ring
     to take advantage of its directing effect. Suppose, for instance, that you needed to make 3,5-dibromotoluene.
     This product can't be made by direct bromination of toluene because reaction would occur at positions 2 and
     4. Starting with p-methylaniline (p-toluidine), however, dibromination occurs ortho to the strongly directing
     amino substituent, and diazotization followed by treatment with H3PO2 to remove the amino group yields the
     desired product.

Mechanistically, these diazonio replacement reactions occur through radical rather than polar pathways. In the
presence of a copper(I) compound, for instance, it's thought that the arenediazonium ion is first converted to an
aryl radical plus copper(II), followed by subsequent reaction to give product plus regenerated copper(I) catalyst.

Strategy
As always, organic syntheses are planned by working retrosynthetically from the final product, one step at
a time. First, identify the functional groups in the product and recall how those groups can be synthesized.
m-Hydroxyacetophenone has an -OH group and a -COCH3 group in a meta relationship on a benzene ring. A

diazotization, and diazonio replacement. An acetyl group is introduced by a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction.
Next, ask yourself what an immediate precursor of the target might be. Since an acetyl group is a meta director
while a hydroxyl group is an ortho and para director, acetophenone might be a precursor of
m-hydroxyacetophenone. Benzene, in turn, is a precursor of acetophenone.

24.9 Heterocyclic Amines

As noted in Section 15.5 in connection with a discussion of aromaticity, a cyclic organic compound that contains
atoms of two or more elements in its ring is a called a heterocycle. Heterocyclic amines are particularly
common, and many have important biological properties. Pyridoxal phosphate, a coenzyme; sildenafil (Viagra),
a well-known pharmaceutical; and heme, the oxygen carrier in blood, are a few examples.

Most heterocycles have the same chemistry as their open-chain counterparts. Lactones and acyclic esters
behave similarly, lactams and acyclic amides behave similarly, and cyclic and acyclic ethers behave similarly.
In certain cases, however, particularly when the ring is unsaturated, heterocycles have unique and interesting
properties.

Pyrrole and Imidazole

Pyrrole, the simplest five-membered unsaturated heterocyclic amine, is obtained commercially by treatment
of furan with ammonia over an alumina catalyst at 400 °C. Furan, the oxygen-containing analog of pyrrole, is
obtained by acid-catalyzed dehydration of the five-carbon sugars found in oat hulls and corncobs.

Although pyrrole appears to be both an amine and a conjugated diene, its chemical properties are not consistent
with either of these structural features. Unlike most other amines, pyrrole is not basic--the pKa of the
pyrrolinium ion is 0.4; unlike most other conjugated dienes, pyrrole undergoes electrophilic substitution
reactions rather than additions. The reason for both of these properties, as noted in Section 15.5, is that pyrrole
has six  electrons and is aromatic. Each of the four carbons contributes one  electron, and the sp2-hybridized
nitrogen contributes two more from its lone pair.
890  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     Because the nitrogen lone pair is a part of the aromatic sextet, protonation on nitrogen would destroy the
     aromaticity of the ring. The nitrogen atom in pyrrole is therefore less electron-rich, less basic, and less
     nucleophilic than the nitrogen in an aliphatic amine. By the same token, the carbon atoms of pyrrole are more
     electron-rich and more nucleophilic than typical double-bond carbons. The pyrrole ring is therefore reactive
     toward electrophiles in the same way as enamines (Section 23.11). Electrostatic potential maps show how the
     pyrrole nitrogen is electron-poor (less red) compared with the nitrogen in its saturated counterpart pyrrolidine,
     while the pyrrole carbon atoms are electron-rich (more red) compared with the carbons in 1,3-cyclopentadiene.

     The chemistry of pyrrole is similar to that of activated benzene rings. In general, however, the heterocycles are
     more reactive toward electrophiles than benzene rings, and low temperatures are often necessary to control
     the reactions. Halogenation, nitration, sulfonation, and Friedel-Crafts acylation can all be accomplished. For
     example:

     Electrophilic substitutions normally occur at C2, the position next to the nitrogen, because reaction at this
     position leads to a more stable intermediate cation having three resonance forms, whereas reaction at C3 gives
     a less stable cation with only two resonance forms (FIGURE 24.8).

Other common five-membered heterocyclic amines include imidazole and thiazole. Imidazole, a constituent
of the amino acid histidine, has two nitrogens, only one of which is basic. Thiazole, the five-membered ring
system on which the structure of thiamin (vitamin B1) is based, also contains a basic nitrogen that is alkylated
in thiamin to form a quaternary ammonium ion.

Pyridine and Pyrimidine

Pyridine is the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic analog of benzene. Like benzene, pyridine is a flat, aromatic
molecule, with bond angles of 120° and C-C bond lengths of 139 pm, intermediate between typical single and
double bonds. The five carbon atoms and the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom each contribute one  electron to
the aromatic sextet, and the lone-pair electrons occupy an sp2 orbital in the plane of the ring (Section 15.5).

As shown previously in TABLE 24.1, pyridine (pKa = 5.25) is a stronger base than pyrrole but a weaker base than
the alkylamines. The diminished basicity of pyridine compared with that of alkylamines is due to the fact that
the lone-pair electrons on the pyridine nitrogen are in an sp2 orbital, while those on an alkylamine nitrogen are
in an sp3 orbital. Because s orbitals have their maximum electron density at the nucleus but p orbitals have a
node at the nucleus, electrons in an orbital with more s character are held more closely to the positively charged
nucleus and are less available for bonding. As a result, the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atom (33% s character) in
892  24 · Amines and Heterocycles

     pyridine is less basic than the sp3-hybridized nitrogen in an alkylamine (25% s character).

     Unlike benzene, pyridine undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with difficulty. Halogenation
     can be carried out under drastic conditions, but nitration occurs in very low yield, and Friedel-Crafts reactions
     are not successful. Reactions usually give the 3-substituted product.

     The low reactivity of pyridine toward electrophilic aromatic substitution is caused by a combination of factors.
     One is that acid-base complexation between the basic ring's nitrogen atom and the incoming electrophile
     places a positive charge on the ring, thereby deactivating it. Equally important is that the electron density of
     the ring is decreased by the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the electronegative nitrogen atom. Thus,
     pyridine has a substantial dipole moment ( = 2.26 D), with the ring carbons acting as the positive end of the
     dipole. Reaction of an electrophile with the positively polarized carbon atoms is therefore difficult.

     In addition to pyridine, the six-membered diamine pyrimidine is also found commonly in biological molecules,
     particularly as a constituent of nucleic acids. With a pKa of 1.3, pyrimidine is substantially less basic than
     pyridine because of the inductive effect of the second nitrogen.

     PROBLEM Electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of pyridine normally occur at C3. Draw the
           24-22 carbocation intermediates resulting from reaction of an electrophile at C2, C3, and C4, and explain
                      the observed result.

     Polycyclic Heterocycles

     As we saw in Section 15.6, quinoline, isoquinoline, indole, and purine are common polycyclic heterocycles. The
     first three contain both a benzene ring and a heterocyclic aromatic ring, while purine contains two heterocyclic
     rings joined together. All four ring systems occur commonly in nature, and many compounds with these rings
     have pronounced physiological activity. The quinoline alkaloid quinine, for instance, is widely used as an
     antimalarial drug; tryptophan is a common amino acid; and the purine adenine is a constituent of nucleic acids.

The chemistry of these polycyclic heterocycles is just what you might expect from a knowledge of the simpler
heterocycles pyridine and pyrrole. Quinoline and isoquinoline both have basic, pyridine-like nitrogen atoms,
and both undergo electrophilic substitutions. As with pyridine, both quinoline and isoquinoline are less reactive
toward electrophilic substitution than benzene because of the electronegative nitrogen atom that withdraws
electrons from the ring. Reaction occurs on the benzene ring rather than on the nitrogen-containing pyridine
ring, and a mixture of substitution products is obtained.

Indole has a nonbasic, pyrrole-like nitrogen and undergoes electrophilic substitution more easily than benzene.
Substitution occurs at C3 of the electron-rich pyrrole ring rather than on the benzene ring.

     24.10 Spectroscopy of Amines

     Infrared Spectroscopy

     Primary and secondary amines can be identified by a characteristic N-H stretching absorption in the 3300 to
     3500 cm-1 range of the IR spectrum. Alcohols also absorb in this range (Section 17.11), but amine absorption
     bands are generally sharper and less intense than hydroxyl bands. Primary amines show a pair of bands at
     about 3350 and 3450 cm-1 from the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes, and secondary amines show
     a single band at 3350 cm-1. Tertiary amines have no absorption in this region because they have no N-H bonds.
     FIGURE 24.9 recalls the IR spectrum of cyclohexylamine from Section 12.8.

                                                                  FIGURE 24.9 IR spectrum of cyclohexylamine.

     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

     Amines are difficult to identify solely by 1H NMR spectroscopy because N-H hydrogens tend to appear as broad
     signals without clear-cut coupling to neighboring C-H hydrogens. As with O-H absorptions (Section 17.11),
     amine N-H absorptions can appear over a wide range and are best identified by adding a small amount of D2O
     to the sample. Exchange of N-D for N-H occurs, and the N-H signal disappears from the NMR spectrum.

Hydrogens on the carbon next to nitrogen are deshielded because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the

nitrogen, and they therefore absorb further downfield than alkane hydrogens. N-Methyl groups are particularly
distinctive because they absorb as a sharp three-proton singlet at 2.2 to 2.6 . This N-methyl resonance at 2.42
 is easily seen in the 1H NMR spectrum of N-methylcyclohexylamine (FIGURE 24.10).

Carbons next to amine nitrogens are slightly deshielded in the 13C NMR spectrum and absorb about 20 ppm
downfield from where they would absorb in an alkane of similar structure. In N-methylcyclohexylamine, for
example, the ring carbon to which nitrogen is attached absorbs at a position 24 ppm downfield from any other
ring carbon.

     Mass Spectrometry

     The nitrogen rule of mass spectrometry says that a compound with an odd number of nitrogen atoms has an
     odd-numbered molecular weight. Thus, the presence of nitrogen in a molecule is detected simply by observing
     its mass spectrum. An odd-numbered molecular ion usually means that the unknown compound has one or
     three nitrogen atoms, and an even-numbered molecular ion usually means that a compound has either zero or
     two nitrogen atoms. The logic behind the rule derives from the fact that nitrogen is trivalent, thus requiring an
     odd number of hydrogen atoms. For example, morphine has the formula C17H19NO3 and a molecular weight of
     285 amu.
     Alkylamines undergo a characteristic  cleavage in the mass spectrometer, similar to the cleavage observed
     for alcohols (Section 17.11). C-C bond nearest the nitrogen atom is broken, yielding an alkyl radical and a
     resonance-stabilized, nitrogen-containing cation.

     As an example, the mass spectrum of N-ethylpropylamine shown in FIGURE 24.11 has peaks at m/z = 58 and
     m/z = 72, corresponding to the two possible modes of  cleavage.

Green Chemistry II: Ionic Liquids

Liquids made of ions? Usually when we think of ionic compounds, we think of high-melting solids: sodium
chloride, magnesium sulfate, lithium carbonate, and so forth. But yes, there are also ionic compounds that are
liquid at room temperature, and they are gaining importance as reaction solvents, particularly for use in green
chemistry processes (see the Chapter 11 Chemistry Matters). More than 1500 ionic liquids are known, and about
500 are available commercially.
Ionic liquids have been studied for nearly a century; the first to be discovered was ethylammonium nitrate,
CH3CH2NH3+ NO3-, with a melting point of 12 °C. More generally, however, the ionic liquids in use today are
salts in which the cation is unsymmetrical and in which one or both of the ions are bulky so that the charges
are dispersed over a large volume. Both factors minimize the crystal lattice energy and disfavor formation of the
solid. Typical cations are quaternary ammonium ions from heterocyclic amines, either 1,3-dialkylimidazolium
ions, N-alkylpyridinium ions, or ring-substituted N-alkylpyridinium ions.

Anions are just as varied as the cations. Hexafluorophosphate, tetrafluoroborate, alkyl sulfates,
trifluoromethanesulfonates (triflates), and halides are some anion possibilities.

Ionic liquids have several important features that make them attractive for use, both as solvents in green
chemistry and as specialty chemicals in such applications as paint additives and refrigerants:

  · They dissolve both polar and nonpolar organic compounds, giving high solute concentrations and thereby
      minimizing the amount of solvent needed.

  · They can be optimized for specific reactions by varying cation and anion structures.
  · They are nonflammable.
  · They are thermally stable.
  · They have negligible vapor pressures and do not evaporate.
  · They are generally recoverable and can be reused many times.
As an example of their use in organic chemistry, the analgesic drug pravadoline has been synthesized in two
steps using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, abbreviated [bmim][PF6], as the solvent for
both steps. The first step is a base-induced SN2 reaction of 2-methylindole with a primary alkyl halide, and the
second is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Both steps take place with 95% yield, and the ionic solvent is recovered
simply by washing the reaction mixture, first with toluene and then with water.

Summary

We've now seen all the common functional groups that occur in organic and biological chemistry. Of those
groups, amines are among the most abundant and have among the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins
and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups and many of the
common coenzymes necessary for biological reactions are amines.

Amines are organic derivatives of ammonia. They are named in the IUPAC system either by adding the suffix
-amine to the name of the alkyl substituent or by considering the amino group as a substituent on a more
complex parent molecule.

The chemistry of amines is dominated by the lone-pair electrons on nitrogen, which makes amines both
basic and nucleophilic. The basicity of arylamines is generally lower than that of alkylamines because the
nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized by interaction with the aromatic  system. Electron-withdrawing
substituents on the aromatic ring further weaken the basicity of a substituted aniline, while electron-donating
substituents increase basicity. Alkylamines are sufficiently basic that they exist almost entirely in their
protonated form at the physiological pH of 7.3.

Heterocyclic amines are compounds that contain one or more nitrogen atoms as part of a ring. Saturated
900 24 · Summary of Reactions

heterocyclic amines usually have the same chemistry as their open-chain analogs, but unsaturated
heterocycles such as pyrrole, imidazole, pyridine, and pyrimidine are aromatic. All four are unusually stable,
and all undergo aromatic substitution on reaction with electrophiles. Pyrrole is nonbasic because its nitrogen
lone-pair electrons are part of the aromatic  system. Fused-ring heterocycles such as quinoline, isoquinoline,
indole, and purine are also commonly found in biological molecules.
Arylamines are prepared by nitration of an aromatic ring followed by reduction. Alkylamines are prepared by
SN2 reaction of ammonia or an amine with an alkyl halide or by the Gabriel amine synthesis. Amines can
also be prepared by a number of reductive methods, including LiAlH4 reduction of amides, nitriles, and azides.
Also important is the reductive amination reaction in which a ketone or an aldehyde is treated with an amine
in the presence of a reducing agent such as NaBH4. In addition, amines result from Hofmann and Curtius
rearrangements of carboxylic acid derivatives. Both methods involve migration of the -R group bonded to the
carbonyl carbon and yield a product that has one less carbon atom than the starting material.
Many of the reactions of amines are familiar from past chapters. Thus, amines react with alkyl halides in
SN2 reactions and with acid chlorides in nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions. Amines also undergo E2
elimination to yield alkenes if they are first quaternized by treatment with iodomethane and then heated with
silver oxide, a process called the Hofmann elimination.
Arylamines are converted by diazotization with nitrous acid into arenediazonium salts, ArN2+ X-. The diazonio
group can then be replaced by many other substituents by the Sandmeyer reaction to give a wide variety
of substituted aromatic compounds. Aryl chlorides, bromides, iodides, and nitriles can be prepared from
arenediazonium salts, as can arenes and phenols. In addition to their reactivity toward substitution reactions,
diazonium salts undergo coupling with phenols and arylamines to give brightly colored azo compounds.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? We've now seen all the common functional groups and reaction types that occur in
organic and biological chemistry. In this and the next four chapters, we'll focus on the major classes of biological
molecules, beginning with a look at the structures and primary biological functions of carbohydrates. Then, in
Chapter 29, we'll return to the subject to see how carbohydrates are both synthesized and degraded in
organisms.
Carbohydrates occur in every living organism. The sugar and starch in food, and the cellulose in wood, paper,
and cotton are nearly pure carbohydrates. Modified carbohydrates form part of the coating around living cells,
other carbohydrates are part of the nucleic acids that carry our genetic information, and still others are used as
medicines.
The word carbohydrate derives historically from the fact that glucose, the first simple carbohydrate to be
obtained in pure form, has the molecular formula C6H12O6 and was originally thought to be a "hydrate of
914  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     carbon, C6(H2O)6." This view was soon abandoned, but the name persisted. Today, the term carbohydrate is
     used to refer loosely to the broad class of polyhydroxylated aldehydes and ketones commonly called sugars.
     Glucose, also known as dextrose in medical work, is the most familiar example.

     Carbohydrates are synthesized by green plants during photosynthesis, a complex process in which sunlight
     provides the energy to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose plus oxygen. Many molecules of glucose are then
     chemically linked for storage by the plant in the form of either cellulose or starch. It has been estimated that
     more than 50% of the dry weight of the earth's biomass--all plants and animals--consists of glucose polymers.
     When eaten and metabolized, carbohydrates then provide animals with a source of readily available energy.
     Thus, carbohydrates act as the chemical intermediaries by which solar energy is stored and used to support life.

     Because humans and most other mammals lack the enzymes needed for digestion of cellulose, they require
     starch as their dietary source of carbohydrates. Grazing animals such as cows, however, have microorganisms
     in their first stomach that are able to digest cellulose. The energy stored in cellulose is thus moved up the
     biological food chain when these ruminant animals eat grass and are themselves used for food.

     25.1 Classification of Carbohydrates

     Carbohydrates are generally classified as either simple or complex. Simple sugars, or monosaccharides, are
     carbohydrates like glucose and fructose that can't be converted into smaller sugars by hydrolysis. Complex
     carbohydrates are made of two or more simple sugars linked together by acetal bonds (Section 19.10). Sucrose
     (table sugar), for instance, consists of one glucose linked to one fructose. Similarly, cellulose is made up of
     several thousand glucose units linked together. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of a complex carbohydrate breaks
     it down into its constituent monosaccharides.

     Monosaccharides are further classified as either aldoses or ketoses. The -ose suffix designates a carbohydrate,
     and the prefixes aldo- and keto- identify the kind of carbonyl group in the molecule, whether aldehyde or ketone.

The number of carbon atoms in the monosaccharide is indicated by the appropriate numerical prefix tri-, tetr-,
pent-, hex-, and so forth, in the name. Putting it all together, glucose is an aldohexose, a six-carbon aldehyde
sugar; fructose is a ketohexose, a six-carbon keto sugar; ribose is an aldopentose, a five-carbon aldehyde sugar;
and sedoheptulose is a ketoheptose, a seven-carbon keto sugar. Most of the common simple sugars are either
pentoses or hexoses.

PROBLEM Classify each of the following monosaccharides:

25.2 Representing Carbohydrate Stereochemistry: Fischer Projections

Because most carbohydrates have numerous chirality centers, it was recognized long ago that a quick method
for representing their stereochemistry was needed. In 1891, the German chemist Emil Fischer suggested a
method based on the projection of a tetrahedral carbon atom onto a flat surface. These Fischer projections
were soon adopted and are still a common means of representing stereochemistry at chirality centers in
carbohydrate chemistry.

A tetrahedral carbon atom is represented in a Fischer projection by two crossed lines. The horizontal lines
represent bonds coming out of the page, and the vertical lines represent bonds going into the page.

For example, (R)-glyceraldehyde, the simplest monosaccharide, can be drawn as in FIGURE 25.2.

                                                     FIGURE 25.2 A Fischer projection of (R)-glyceraldehyde.

Because a given chiral molecule can be drawn in many ways, it's sometimes necessary to compare two
projections to see if they represent the same or different enantiomers. To test for identity, Fischer projections
can be moved around on the paper, but only two kinds of motions are allowed; moving a Fischer projection in
any other way inverts its meaning.

  · A Fischer projection can be rotated on the page by 180°, but not by 90° or 270°. Only a 180° rotation
916  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     maintains the Fischer convention by keeping the same substituent groups going into and coming out of the
     plane. In the following Fischer projection of (R)-glyceraldehyde, for instance, the -H and -OH groups come
     out of the plane both before and after a 180° rotation.

     A 90° rotation breaks the Fischer convention by exchanging the groups that go into the plane with those
     that come out. In the following Fischer projections of (R)-glyceraldehyde, the -H and -OH groups originally
     come out of the plane but go into the plane after a 90° rotation. As a result, the rotated projection represents
     (S)-glyceraldehyde.

       · A Fischer projection can also have one group held steady while the other three rotate in either a clockwise
           or a counterclockwise direction. The effect is simply to rotate around a single bond, which does not change
           the stereochemistry.

     R,S stereochemical designations (Section 5.5) can be assigned to the chirality center in a Fischer projection by
     following three steps, as shown in Worked Example 25.1.
     STEP 1
     Rank the four substituents in the usual way (Section 5.5).
     STEP 2
     Place the group of lowest ranking, usually H, at the top of the Fischer projection by using one of the allowed
     motions. This means that the lowest-ranked group is oriented back, away from the viewer, as required for
     assigning configuration.
     STEP 3
     Determine the direction of rotation 1  2  3 of the remaining three groups, and assign R or S configuration.
     Carbohydrates with more than one chirality center are shown in Fischer projections by stacking the centers on
     top of one another, with the carbonyl carbon at or near the top. Glucose, for example, has four chirality centers
     stacked on top of one another in a Fischer projection. Such representations don't, however, give an accurate

        WORKED EXAMPLE 25.1
Assigning R or S Configuration to a Fischer Projection

Assign R or S configuration to the following Fischer projection of alanine:

Strategy
Follow the steps in the text. (1) Rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon. (2) Manipulate the Fischer
projection to place the group of lowest ranking at the top by carrying out one of the allowed motions. (3)
Determine the direction 1  2  3 of the remaining three groups.
Solution
The rankings of the groups are (1) -NH2, (2) -CO2H, (3) -CH3, and (4) -H. To bring the group of lowest ranking
(-H) to the top, we might want to hold the -CH3 group steady while rotating the other three groups
counterclockwise.

Going from first- to second- to third-highest ranking requires a counterclockwise turn, corresponding to S
stereochemistry.

             25-5 chirality center:

     25.3 D,L Sugars

     Glyceraldehyde, the simplest aldose, has only one chirality center and thus has two enantiomeric (nonidentical
     mirror-image) forms. Only the dextrorotatory enantiomer occurs naturally, however. That is, a sample of
     naturally occurring glyceraldehyde placed in a polarimeter rotates plane-polarized light in a clockwise
     direction, denoted (+). Since (+)-glyceraldehyde has been found to have an R configuration at C2, it can be
     represented by a Fischer projection as shown previously in FIGURE 25.2. For historical reasons dating back
     long before the adoption of the R,S system, (R)-(+)-glyceraldehyde is also referred to as D-glyceraldehyde (D for
     dextrorotatory). The other enantiomer, (S)-(-)-glyceraldehyde, is known as L-glyceraldehyde (L for levorotatory).

     Because of the way that monosaccharides are biosynthesized in nature, glucose, fructose, and most other
     naturally occurring monosaccharides all have the same R stereochemical configuration as D-glyceraldehyde at
     the chirality center farthest from the carbonyl group. In Fischer projections, therefore, most naturally occurring
     sugars have the hydroxyl group at the bottom chirality center pointing to the right (FIGURE 25.3). Such
     compounds are referred to as D sugars.

FIGURE 25.3 Some naturally occurring D sugars. The -OH group at the chirality center farthest from the carbonyl group has the same
configuration as (R)-(+)-glyceraldehyde and points toward the right in Fischer projections.

In contrast with D sugars, L sugars have an S configuration at the lowest chirality center, with the bottom -OH
group pointing to the left in Fischer projections. Thus, an L sugar is the mirror image (enantiomer) of the
corresponding D sugar and has the opposite configuration from the D sugar at all chirality centers.

Note that the D and L notations have no relation to the direction in which a given sugar rotates plane-polarized
light. A D sugar can be either dextrorotatory or levorotatory. The prefix D indicates only that the -OH group at the
lowest chirality center has R stereochemistry and points to the right when the molecule is drawn in a standard
Fischer projection. Note also that the D,L system of carbohydrate nomenclature describes the configuration at
only one chirality center and says nothing about the configuration of other chirality centers that may be present.

PROBLEM Assign R or S configuration to each chirality center in the following monosaccharides, and tell
        25-6 whether each is a D sugar or an L sugar:

                 as a D sugar or an L sugar.

25.4 Configurations of the Aldoses

An aldotetrose is a four-carbon sugar with two chirality centers. Thus, there are 22 = 4 possible stereoisomeric
aldotetroses, or two D,L pairs of enantiomers named erythrose and threose.

Aldopentoses have three chirality centers and a total of 23 = 8 possible stereoisomers, or four D,L pairs of
enantiomers. These four pairs are called ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose. All except lyxose occur widely in
nature. D-Ribose is an important constituent of RNA (ribonucleic acid), L-arabinose is found in many plants, and
920  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     D-xylose is found in wood.

     Aldohexoses have four chirality centers and a total of 24 = 16 possible stereoisomers, or eight D,L pairs of
     enantiomers. The names of the eight are allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and talose.
     Only D-glucose, from starch and cellulose, and D-galactose, from gums and fruit pectins, are widely distributed
     in nature. D-mannose and D-talose also occur naturally but in lesser abundance.

     Fischer projections of the four-, five-, and six-carbon D aldoses are shown in FIGURE 25.4. Starting with
     D-glyceraldehyde, we can imagine constructing the two D aldotetroses by inserting a new chirality center just
     below the aldehyde carbon. Each of the two D aldotetroses then leads to two D aldopentoses (four total), and each
     of the four D aldopentoses leads to two D aldohexoses (eight total). In addition, each of the D aldoses in FIGURE
     25.4 has an L enantiomer, which is not shown.

FIGURE 25.4 Configurations of D aldoses. The structures are arranged from left to right so that the -OH groups on C2 alternate right/left
(R/L) across each series. Similarly, the -OH groups at C3 alternate two right/two left (2R/2L), the -OH groups at C4 alternate 4R/4L, and the
-OH groups at C5 are to the right in all eight (8R). Each D aldose has a corresponding L enantiomer that is not shown.

Louis Fieser of Harvard University long ago suggested a simple procedure for remembering the names and
structures of the eight D aldohexoses:

STEP 1
Set up eight Fischer projections with the -CHO group on top and the -CH2OH group at the bottom.

STEP 2
At C5, place all eight -OH groups to the right (D series).

     STEP 3
     At C4, alternate four -OH groups to the right and four to the left.

     At C3, alternate two -OH groups to the right, two to the left.
     STEP 5
     At C2, alternate -OH groups right, left, right, left.
     STEP 6
     Name the eight isomers using the mnemonic "All altruists gladly make gum in gallon tanks."
     The structures of the four D aldopentoses can be generated in a similar way and named by the mnemonic
     suggested by a Cornell University undergraduate: "RIBs ARe eXtra Lean."

25.5 Cyclic Structures of Monosaccharides: Anomers

We said in Section 19.10 that aldehydes and ketones undergo a rapid and reversible nucleophilic addition
reaction with alcohols to form hemiacetals.

If the carbonyl and the hydroxyl group are in the same molecule, an intramolecular nucleophilic addition can
take place, leading to the formation of a cyclic hemiacetal. Five- and six-membered cyclic hemiacetals are
relatively strain-free and particularly stable, and many carbohydrates therefore exist in an equilibrium between
open-chain and cyclic forms. Glucose, for instance, exists in aqueous solution primarily in the six-membered
pyranose form resulting from intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the -OH group at C5 to the C1 carbonyl
group (FIGURE 25.5). The name pyranose is derived from pyran, the name of the unsaturated six-membered
cyclic ether.
Like cyclohexane rings (Section 4.6), pyranose rings have a chairlike geometry with axial and equatorial
substituents. By convention, the rings are usually drawn by placing the hemiacetal oxygen atom at the right rear,
924  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     as shown in FIGURE 25.5. Note that an -OH group on the right in a Fischer projection is on the bottom face of the
     pyranose ring, and an -OH group on the left in a Fischer projection is on the top face of the ring. For D sugars,
     the terminal -CH2OH group is on the top of the ring, whereas for L sugars, the -CH2OH group is on the bottom.

     When an open-chain monosaccharide cyclizes to a pyranose form, a new chirality center is generated at the
     former carbonyl carbon and two diastereomers, called anomers, are produced. The hemiacetal carbon atom
     is referred to as the anomeric center. For example, glucose cyclizes reversibly in aqueous solution to a 37 : 63
     mixture of two anomers (FIGURE 25.5). The compound with its newly generated -OH group at C1 cis to the -OH
     at the lowest chirality center in a Fischer projection is called the  anomer; its full name is -D-glucopyranose.
     The compound with its newly generated -OH group trans to the -OH at the lowest chirality center is called the 
     anomer; its full name is -D-glucopyranose. Note that in -D-glucopyranose, all the substituents on the ring are
     equatorial. Thus, -D-glucopyranose is the least sterically crowded and most stable of the eight D aldohexoses.

     FIGURE 25.5 Glucose in its cyclic pyranose forms. As explained in the text, two anomers are formed by cyclization of glucose. The molecule
     whose newly formed -OH group at C1 is cis to the oxygen atom on the lowest chirality center (C5) in a Fischer projection is the  anomer. The
     molecule whose newly formed -OH group is trans to the oxygen atom on the lowest chirality center in a Fischer projection is the  anomer.

     Some monosaccharides also exist in a five-membered cyclic hemiacetal form called a furanose. D-Fructose, for
     instance, exists in water solution as 68% -pyranose, 2.7% -pyranose, 0.5% open-chain, 22.4% -furanose,
     and 6.2% -furanose. The pyranose form results from addition of the -OH at C6 to the carbonyl group, while the
     furanose form results from addition of the -OH at C5 to the carbonyl group (FIGURE 25.6).

Both anomers of D-glucopyranose can be crystallized and purified. Pure -D-glucopyranose has a melting point
of 146 °C and a specific rotation []D = +112.2; pure -D-glucopyranose has a melting point of 148 to 155 °C
and a specific rotation []D = +18.7. When a sample of either pure anomer is dissolved in water, however, its
optical rotation slowly changes until it reaches a constant value of +52.6. That is, the specific rotation of the
-anomer solution decreases from +112.2 to +52.6, and the specific rotation of the -anomer solution increases
from +18.7 to +52.6. Called mutarotation, this change in optical rotation is due to the slow interconversion of
the pure anomers to give the same 37 : 63 equilibrium mixture.
Mutarotation occurs by a reversible ring-opening of each anomer to the open-chain aldehyde, followed by
reclosure. Although the equilibration is slow at neutral pH, it is catalyzed by both acid and base.

25.6 Reactions of Monosaccharides

Because monosaccharides have only two kinds of functional groups, hydroxyls and carbonyls, most of the
chemistry of monosaccharides is the familiar chemistry of these two groups. As we've seen, alcohols can be
converted into esters and ethers and can be oxidized; carbonyl compounds can react with nucleophiles and can
be reduced.

Ester and Ether Formation

Monosaccharides behave as simple alcohols in much of their chemistry. For example, carbohydrate -OH groups
can be converted into esters and ethers, which are often easier to work with than the free sugars. Because of
their many hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are usually soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents
such as ether. They are also difficult to purify and have a tendency to form syrups rather than crystals when
water is removed. Ester and ether derivatives, however, are soluble in organic solvents and are easily purified
and crystallized.
Esterification is normally carried out by treating a carbohydrate with an acid chloride or acid anhydride in the
presence of a base (Section 21.4 and Section 21.5). All the -OH groups react, including the anomeric one. For
example, -D-glucopyranose is converted into its pentaacetate by treatment with acetic anhydride in pyridine
solution.

Carbohydrates are converted into ethers by treatment with an alkyl halide in the presence of base--the
Williamson ether synthesis (Section 18.2). Standard Williamson conditions using a strong base tend to degrade
sensitive sugar molecules, but silver oxide works well as a mild base and gives high yields of ethers. For
example, -D-glucopyranose is converted into its pentamethyl ether in 85% yield on reaction with iodomethane
and Ag2O.

     Glycoside Formation

     We saw in Section 19.10 that treatment of a hemiacetal with an alcohol and an acid catalyst yields an acetal.

     In the same way, treatment of a monosaccharide hemiacetal with an alcohol and an acid catalyst yields an acetal
     called a glycoside, in which the anomeric -OH has been replaced by an -OR group. For example, reaction of
     -D-glucopyranose with methanol gives a mixture of  and  methyl D-glucopyranosides. (Note that a glycoside
     is the functional group name for any sugar, whereas a glucoside is formed specifically from glucose.)

     Glycosides are named by first citing the alkyl group and then replacing the -ose ending of the sugar with -oside.
     Like all acetals, glycosides are stable in neutral water. They aren't in equilibrium with an open-chain form, and
     they don't show mutarotation. They can, however, be hydrolyzed to give back the free monosaccharide plus
     alcohol on treatment with aqueous acid (Section 19.10).

     Glycosides are abundant in nature, and many biologically important molecules contain glycosidic linkages. For
     example, digitoxin, the active component of the digitalis preparations used for treatment of heart disease, is a
     glycoside consisting of a steroid alcohol linked to a trisaccharide. Note also that the three sugars are linked to
     one another by glycoside bonds.

     The laboratory synthesis of glycosides can be difficult because of the numerous -OH groups on the sugar
     molecule. One method that is particularly suitable for preparing glucose -glycosides involves treatment of
     glucose pentaacetate with HBr, followed by addition of the appropriate alcohol in the presence of silver oxide.
     Called the Koenigs-Knorr reaction, the sequence involves formation of a pyranosyl bromide, followed by
     nucleophilic substitution. For example, methylarbutin, a glycoside found in pears, has been prepared by
     reaction of tetraacetyl--D-glucopyranosyl bromide with p-methoxyphenol.

Although the Koenigs-Knorr reaction appears to involve a simple backside SN2 displacement of bromide ion
by alkoxide ion, the situation is actually more complex. Both  and  anomers of tetraacetyl-D-glucopyranosyl
bromide give the same -glycoside product, implying that they react by a common pathway.

This result can be understood by assuming that tetraacetyl-D-glucopyranosyl bromide (either  or  anomer)
undergoes a spontaneous SN1-like loss of Br-, followed by internal reaction with the ester group at C2 to form
an oxonium ion. Since the acetate at C2 is on the bottom of the glucose ring, the C-O bond also forms from the

bottom. Backside SN2 displacement of the oxonium ion then occurs with the usual inversion of configuration,
yielding a -glycoside and regenerating the acetate at C2 (FIGURE 25.7).

             FIGURE 25.7 Mechanism of the Koenigs-Knorr reaction, showing the neighboring-group effect of a nearby acetate.

The participation shown by the nearby acetate group in the Koenigs-Knorr reaction is referred to as a
neighboring-group effect and is a common occurrence in organic chemistry. Neighboring-group effects are
usually noticeable only because they affect the rate or stereochemistry of a reaction; the nearby group itself
does not undergo any evident change during the reaction.

Biological Ester Formation: Phosphorylation

In living organisms, carbohydrates occur not only in the free form but also linked through their anomeric center
to other molecules such as lipids (glycolipids) or proteins (glycoproteins). Collectively called glycoconjugates,
these sugar-linked molecules are components of cell walls that are crucial to the mechanism by which different
cell types recognize one another.

Glycoconjugate formation occurs by reaction of the lipid or protein with a glycosyl nucleoside diphosphate.
This diphosphate is itself formed by initial reaction of a monosaccharide with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
to give a glycosyl monophosphate, followed by reaction with uridine triphosphate (UTP), to give a glycosyl
uridine diphosphate. (We'll see the structures of nucleoside phosphates in Section 28.1.) The purpose of the
phosphorylation is to activate the anomeric -OH group of the sugar and make it a better leaving group in a
nucleophilic substitution reaction by a protein or lipid (FIGURE 25.8).
930  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     FIGURE 25.8 Glycoprotein formation occurs by initial phosphorylation of the starting carbohydrate with ATP to a glycosyl
     monophosphate, followed by reaction with UTP to form a glycosyl uridine 5-diphosphate. Nucleophilic substitution by an -OH (or -NH2)
     group on a protein then gives the glycoprotein.

     Reduction of Monosaccharides

     Treatment of an aldose or ketose with NaBH4 reduces it to a polyalcohol called an alditol. The reduction occurs
     by reaction of the open-chain form present in the aldehyde/ketone hemiacetal equilibrium. Although only
     a small amount of the open-chain form is present at any given time, that small amount is reduced, more is
     produced by opening of the pyranose form, that additional amount is reduced, and so on, until the entire sample
     has undergone reaction.

     D-Glucitol, the alditol produced by reduction of D-glucose, is itself a naturally occurring substance found in
     many fruits and berries. It is used under the name D-sorbitol as a sweetener and sugar substitute in many foods.

Oxidation of Monosaccharides

Like other aldehydes, aldoses are easily oxidized to yield the corresponding carboxylic acids, called aldonic
acids. A buffered solution of aqueous Br2 is often used for this purpose.

Historically, the oxidation of an aldose with either Ag+ in aqueous ammonia (called Tollens' reagent) or Cu2+
with aqueous sodium citrate (Benedict's reagent) formed the basis of simple tests for what are called reducing
sugars. (Reducing because the aldose reduces the metal oxidizing agent.) Some simple diabetes self-test kits
sold in drugstores still use Benedict's reagent to detect glucose in urine, though more modern methods have
largely replaced it.

All aldoses are reducing sugars because they contain an aldehyde group, but some ketoses are reducing sugars
as well. Fructose reduces Tollens' reagent, for example, even though it contains no aldehyde group. Reduction
occurs because fructose is readily isomerized to a mixture of aldoses (glucose and mannose) in basic solution by
a series of keto-enol tautomeric shifts (FIGURE 25.9). Glycosides, however, are nonreducing because the acetal
group is not hydrolyzed to an aldehyde under basic conditions.

FIGURE 25.9 Fructose, a ketose, is a reducing sugar because it undergoes two base-catalyzed keto-enol tautomerizations that result
in conversion to a mixture of aldoses.

If warm, dilute HNO3 (nitric acid) is used as the oxidizing agent, an aldose is oxidized to a dicarboxylic acid
called an aldaric acid. Both the aldehyde carbonyl and the terminal -CH2OH group are oxidized in this reaction.

Finally, if only the -CH2OH end of the aldose is oxidized without affecting the -CHO group, the product is a
monocarboxylic acid called a uronic acid. The reaction can only be done enzymatically; no chemical reagent is
known that can accomplish this selective oxidation in the laboratory.

           25-20 yield optically inactive (meso) aldaric acids? (See Problem 25-19.)

     Chain Lengthening: The Kiliani-Fischer Synthesis

     Much early activity in carbohydrate chemistry was devoted to unraveling the stereochemical relationships
     among monosaccharides. One of the most important methods used was the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis, which
     results in the lengthening of an aldose chain by one carbon atom. The C1 aldehyde group of the starting sugar
     becomes C2 of the chain-lengthened sugar, and a new C1 carbon is added. For example, an aldopentose is
     converted by Kiliani-Fischer synthesis into two aldohexoses.

     Discovery of the chain-lengthening sequence was initiated by the observation of Heinrich Kiliani in 1886 that
     aldoses react with HCN to form cyanohydrins (Section 19.6). Emil Fischer immediately realized the importance
     of Kiliani's discovery and devised a method for converting the cyanohydrin nitrile group into an aldehyde.

     Fischer's original method for conversion of the nitrile into an aldehyde involved hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid,
     ring closure to a cyclic ester (lactone), and subsequent reduction. A modern improvement involves reducing the
     nitrile over a palladium catalyst, yielding an imine intermediate that is hydrolyzed to an aldehyde. Note that the
     cyanohydrin is formed as a mixture of stereoisomers at the new chirality center, so two new aldoses, differing
     only in their stereochemistry at C2, result from Kiliani-Fischer synthesis. Chain extension of D-arabinose, for
     example, yields a mixture of D-glucose and D-mannose.

Chain Shortening: The Wohl Degradation

Just as the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis lengthens an aldose chain by one carbon, the Wohl degradation shortens
an aldose chain by one carbon. Wohl degradation is almost the exact opposite of the Kiliani-Fischer sequence.
That is, the aldose aldehyde carbonyl group is first converted into a nitrile, and the resulting cyanohydrin loses
HCN under basic conditions--the reverse of a nucleophilic addition reaction.

Conversion of the aldehyde into a nitrile is accomplished by treatment of an aldose with hydroxylamine to give
an imine called an oxime (Section 19.8), followed by dehydration of the oxime with acetic anhydride. The Wohl
degradation does not give particularly high yields of chain-shortened aldoses, but the reaction is general for all
aldopentoses and aldohexoses. For example, D-galactose is converted by Wohl degradation into D-lyxose.

PROBLEM Two of the four D aldopentoses yield D-threose on Wohl degradation. What are their structures?

25.7 The Eight Essential Monosaccharides

Humans need to obtain eight monosaccharides for proper functioning. Although all eight can be biosynthesized
from simpler precursors if necessary, it's more energetically efficient to obtain them from the diet. The eight
are L-fucose (6-deoxy-L-galactose), D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine,
N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, D-xylose, and N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid (FIGURE 25.10). All are used for the
synthesis of the glycoconjugate components of cell membranes, and glucose is also the body's primary source
of energy.

     Of the eight essential monosaccharides, galactose, glucose, and mannose are simple aldohexoses, while xylose
     is an aldopentose. Fucose is a deoxy sugar, meaning that it has an oxygen atom "missing." That is, an -OH group
     (the one at C6) is replaced by an -H. N-Acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine are amide derivatives of
     amino sugars in which an -OH (the one at C2) is replaced by an -NH2 group. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the
     parent compound of the sialic acids, a group of more than 30 compounds with different modifications, including
     various oxidations, acetylations, sulfations, and methylations. Note that neuraminic acid has nine carbons and
     is an aldol reaction product of N-acetylmannosamine with pyruvate (CH3COCO2-). Neuraminic acid is crucial to
     the mechanism by which an influenza virus spreads.
     All the essential monosaccharides arise from glucose, by the conversions summarized in FIGURE 25.11. We'll

25.8 Disaccharides

We saw in Section 25.6 that reaction of a monosaccharide with an alcohol yields a glycoside in which the
anomeric -OH group is replaced by an -OR substituent. If the alcohol is itself a sugar, the glycosidic product is
a disaccharide.

Maltose and Cellobiose

Disaccharides contain a glycosidic acetal bond between the anomeric carbon of one sugar and an -OH group at
any position on the other sugar. A glycosidic bond between C1 of the first sugar and the -OH at C4 of the second
sugar is particularly common. Such a bond is called a 14 link.
The glycosidic bond to an anomeric carbon can be either  or . Maltose, the disaccharide obtained by enzyme-
catalyzed hydrolysis of starch, consists of two -D-glucopyranose units joined by a 14--glycoside bond.
Cellobiose, the disaccharide obtained by partial hydrolysis of cellulose, consists of two -D-glucopyranose units
joined by a 14--glycoside bond.
936  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     Maltose and cellobiose are both reducing sugars because the anomeric carbons on their right-hand
     glucopyranose units have hemiacetal groups and are in equilibrium with aldehyde forms. For a similar reason,
     both maltose and cellobiose exhibit mutarotation of  and  anomers of the glucopyranose unit on the right.

     Despite the similarities of their structures, cellobiose and maltose have dramatically different biological
     properties. Cellobiose can't be digested by humans and can't be fermented by yeast. Maltose, however, is

     Lactose is a disaccharide that occurs naturally in both human and cow's milk. It is widely used in baking and
     in commercial milk formulas for infants. Like maltose and cellobiose, lactose is a reducing sugar. It exhibits
     mutarotation and is a 14--linked glycoside. Unlike maltose and cellobiose, however, lactose contains two
     different monosaccharides--D-glucose and D-galactose--joined by a -glycosidic bond between C1 of galactose
     and C4 of glucose.

Sucrose

Sucrose, or ordinary table sugar, is probably the most abundant pure organic chemical in the world. Whether
from sugar cane (20% sucrose by weight) or sugar beets (15% by weight), and whether raw or refined, all table
sugar is sucrose.
Sucrose is a disaccharide that yields 1 equivalent of glucose and 1 equivalent of fructose on hydrolysis. This 1 : 1
mixture of glucose and fructose is often referred to as invert sugar because the sign of optical rotation changes,
or inverts, during the hydrolysis of sucrose ([]D = +66.5) to a glucose/ fructose mixture ([]D = -22.0). Some
insects, such as honeybees, have enzymes called invertases that catalyze the sucrose hydrolysis. Honey, in fact,
is primarily a mixture of glucose, fructose, and sucrose.
Unlike most other disaccharides, sucrose is not a reducing sugar and does not undergo mutarotation. These
observations imply that sucrose is not a hemiacetal and that glucose and fructose must both be glycosides.
This can happen only if the two sugars are joined by a glycoside link between the anomeric carbons of both
sugars--C1 of glucose and C2 of fructose.

25.9 Polysaccharides and Their Synthesis

Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates in which tens, hundreds, or even thousands of simple sugars are
linked together through glycoside bonds. Because they have only the one free anomeric -OH group at the end
of a very long chain, polysaccharides aren't reducing sugars and don't show noticeable mutarotation. Cellulose
and starch are the two most widely occurring polysaccharides.

Cellulose

Cellulose consists of several thousand D-glucose units linked by 14--glycoside bonds like those in cellobiose.
Different cellulose molecules then interact to form a large aggregate structure held together by hydrogen bonds.
938  25 · Biomolecules: Carbohydrates

     Nature uses cellulose primarily as a structural material to impart strength and rigidity to plants. Leaves,
     grasses, and cotton, for instance, are primarily cellulose. Cellulose also serves as raw material for the
     manufacture of cellulose acetate, known commercially as acetate rayon, and cellulose nitrate, known as
     guncotton, which is the major ingredient in smokeless powder, the explosive propellant used in artillery shells
     and in ammunition for firearms.

     Starch and Glycogen

     Potatoes, corn, and cereal grains contain large amounts of starch, a polymer of glucose in which the
     monosaccharide units are linked by 14--glycoside bonds like those in maltose. Starch can be separated into
     two fractions: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose accounts for about 20% by weight of starch and consists of
     several hundred glucose molecules linked together by 14--glycoside bonds.

     Amylopectin accounts for the remaining 80% of starch and is more complex in structure than amylose. Unlike
     cellulose and amylose, which are linear polymers, amylopectin contains 16--glycoside branches

     approximately every 25 glucose units.

     Starch is digested in the mouth and stomach by -glycosidases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of glycoside
     bonds and release individual molecules of glucose. Like most enzymes, -glycosidases are highly selective in
     their action. They hydrolyze only the -glycoside links in starch and leave the -glycoside links in cellulose

untouched. Thus, humans can digest potatoes and grains but not grass and leaves.

Glycogen is a polysaccharide that serves the same energy storage function in animals that starch serves in
plants. Dietary carbohydrates not needed for immediate energy are converted by the body into glycogen for
long-term storage. Like the amylopectin found in starch, glycogen contains a complex branching structure
with both 14 and 16 links (FIGURE 25.12). Glycogen molecules are larger than those of amylopectin--up to
100,000 glucose units--and contain even more branches.

FIGURE 25.12 A representation of the structure of glycogen. The hexagons represent glucose units linked by 14 and 16 glycoside
bonds.

Polysaccharide Synthesis

With numerous -OH groups of similar reactivity, polysaccharides are so structurally complex that their
laboratory synthesis has long been a particularly difficult problem. Several methods have recently been
devised, however, that have greatly simplified the problem. Among these approaches is the glycal assembly
method.
Easily prepared from the appropriate monosaccharide, a glycal is an unsaturated sugar with a C1-C2 double
bond. To ready it for use in polysaccharide synthesis, the glycal is first protected at its primary -OH group by
formation of a silyl ether (Section 17.8) and at its two adjacent secondary -OH groups by formation of a cyclic
carbonate ester. Then, the protected glycal is epoxidized.

Treatment of the protected glycal epoxide in the presence of ZnCl2 as a Lewis acid with a second glycal having
a free -OH group causes acid-catalyzed opening of the epoxide ring by SN2 backside attack (Section 18.6) and
yields a disaccharide. The disaccharide is itself a glycal, so it can be epoxidized and coupled again to yield a
trisaccharide, and so on. Using the appropriate sugars at each step, a great variety of polysaccharides can be

     25.10 Some Other Important Carbohydrates

     In addition to the common carbohydrates mentioned in previous sections, there are a variety of important
     carbohydrate-derived materials. Their structural resemblance to sugars is clear, but they aren't simple aldoses
     or ketoses.
     Deoxy sugars, as we saw in Section 25.7, have an oxygen atom "missing." That is, an -OH group is replaced
     by an -H. The most common deoxy sugar is 2-deoxyribose, a monosaccharide found in DNA (deoxyribonucleic
     acid). Note that 2-deoxyribose exists in water solution as a complex equilibrium mixture of both furanose and
     pyranose forms.

     Amino sugars, such as D-glucosamine, have an -OH group replaced by an -NH2. The N-acetyl amide derived
     from D-glucosamine is the monosaccharide unit from which chitin, the hard crust that protects insects and
     shellfish, is made. Still other amino sugars are found in antibiotics such as streptomycin and gentamicin.

Sweetness

Say the word sugar and most people immediately think of sweet-tasting candies, desserts, and such. In fact,
most simple carbohydrates do taste sweet but the degree of sweetness varies greatly from one sugar to another.
With sucrose (table sugar) as a reference point, fructose is nearly twice as sweet, but lactose is only about
one-sixth as sweet. Comparisons are difficult, though, because perceived sweetness varies depending on the
concentration of the solution being tasted and on personal opinion. Nevertheless, the ordering in TABLE 25.1 is
generally accepted.

The desire of many people to cut their caloric intake has led to the development of synthetic sweeteners such as
saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame, and sucralose. All are far sweeter than natural sugars, so the choice of one
or another depends on personal taste, government regulations, and (for baked goods) heat stability. Saccharin,
the oldest synthetic sweetener, has been used for more than a century, although it has a somewhat metallic
aftertaste. Doubts about its safety and potential carcinogenicity were raised in the early 1970s, but it has now
been cleared of suspicion for human consumption.

Acesulfame potassium, one of the more recently approved sweeteners, is proving to be extremely popular in soft
drinks because it has little aftertaste. Sucralose, another recent sweetener, is particularly useful in baked goods
because of its stability at high temperatures. Alitame, marketed in some countries under the name Aclame, is
not approved for sale in the United States. It is some 2000 times as sweet as sucrose and, like acesulfame-K,
has no aftertaste. Of the eight synthetic sweeteners listed in TABLE 25.1, only sucralose has clear structural
resemblance to a carbohydrate, although it differs dramatically in containing three chlorine atoms. Aspartame,
Alitame, and Advantame are dipeptides.

Summary

Now that we've now seen all the common functional groups and reaction types, our focus has changed to looking
at the major classes of biological molecules. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones. They are
classified according to the number of carbon atoms and the kind of carbonyl group they contain. Glucose, for
example, is an aldohexose, a six-carbon aldehydo sugar. Monosaccharides are further classified as either D
sugars or L sugars, depending on the stereochemistry of the chirality center farthest from the carbonyl group.
Carbohydrate stereochemistry is frequently depicted using Fischer projections, which represent a chirality
center as the intersection of two crossed lines.

Monosaccharides normally exist as cyclic hemiacetals rather than as open-chain aldehydes or ketones. The
hemiacetal linkage results from reaction of the carbonyl group with an -OH group three or four carbon atoms
away. A five-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called a furanose, and a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called
a pyranose. Cyclization leads to the formation of a new chirality center called the anomeric center and the
production of two diastereomeric hemiacetals called alpha () and beta () anomers.

Much of the chemistry of monosaccharides is the familiar chemistry of alcohols and aldehydes/ketones. Thus,
the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates form esters and ethers. The carbonyl group of a monosaccharide can be
reduced with NaBH4 to form an alditol, oxidized with aqueous Br2 to form an aldonic acid, oxidized with HNO3
to form an aldaric acid, oxidized enzymatically to form a uronic acid, or treated with an alcohol in the presence
of acid to form a glycoside. Monosaccharides can also be chain-lengthened by the multistep Kiliani-Fischer
synthesis and can be chain-shortened by Wohl degradation.

Disaccharides are complex carbohydrates in which simple sugars are linked by a glycoside bond between the
anomeric center of one unit and a hydroxyl of the second unit. The sugars can be the same, as in maltose and
cellobiose, or different, as in lactose and sucrose. The glycosidic bond can be either  (maltose) or  (cellobiose,
lactose) and can involve any hydroxyl of the second sugar. A 14 link is most common (cellobiose, maltose), but
others such as 12 (sucrose) are also known. Polysaccharides, such as cellulose, starch, and glycogen, are used
in nature as structural materials, as a means of long-term energy storage, and as cell-surface markers.

     functions. The keratin of skin and fingernails, the fibroin of silk and spider webs, and the estimated 50,000 or
     so enzymes that catalyze the biological reactions in our bodies are all proteins. Regardless of their function, all
     proteins have a fundamentally similar structure and are made up of many amino acids linked together in a long
     chain.

     Amino acids, as their name implies, are difunctional. They contain both a basic amino group and an acidic
     carboxyl group.

     Their value as building blocks to make proteins stems from the fact that amino acids can join together into
     long chains by forming amide bonds between the -NH2 of one amino acid and the -CO2H of another. For
     classification purposes, chains with fewer than 50 amino acids are often called peptides, while the term protein
     is generally used for larger chains.

     26.1 Structures of Amino Acids

     We saw in Section 20.3 and Section 24.5 that a carboxyl group is deprotonated and exists as the carboxylate
     anion at a physiological pH of 7.3, while an amino group is protonated and exists as the ammonium cation.
     Thus, amino acids exist in aqueous solution primarily in the form of a dipolar ion, or zwitterion (from the
     German zwitter, meaning "hybrid").

     Amino acid zwitterions are internal salts and therefore have many of the physical properties associated with
     salts. They have large dipole moments, are relatively soluble in water but insoluble in hydrocarbons, and are
     crystalline with relatively high melting points. In addition, amino acids are amphiprotic; they can react either
     as acids or as bases, depending on the circumstances. In aqueous acid solution, an amino acid zwitterion is a
     base that accepts a proton onto its -CO2- group to yield a cation. In aqueous base solution, the zwitterion is an
     acid that loses a proton from its -NH3+ group to form an anion.

The structures, abbreviations (both three- and one-letter), and pKa values of the 20 amino acids commonly
found in proteins are shown in TABLE 26.1. All are -amino acids, meaning that the amino group in each
is a substituent on the  carbon--the one next to the carbonyl group. Nineteen of the twenty amino acids

are primary amines, RNH2, and differ only in the nature of their side chain--the substituent attached to the
 carbon. Proline is a secondary amine whose nitrogen and  carbon atoms are part of a five-membered

pyrrolidine ring.

In addition to the 20 amino acids commonly found in proteins, 2 others--selenocysteine and pyrrolysine--are
found in some organisms, and more than 700 nonprotein amino acids are also found in nature. -Aminobutyric
acid (GABA), for instance, is found in the brain and acts as a neurotransmitter; homocysteine is found in blood
and is linked to coronary heart disease; and thyroxine is found in the thyroid gland, where it acts as a hormone.
956  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     Except for glycine, H2NCH2CO2H, the  carbons of amino acids are chirality centers. Two enantiomers of each
     are therefore possible, but nature uses only one to build proteins. In Fischer projections, naturally occurring
     amino acids are represented by placing the -CO2- group at the top and pointing the side chain downwards,
     as if drawing a carbohydrate (Section 25.2) and then placing the -NH3+ group on the left. Because of their
     stereochemical similarity to L sugars (Section 25.3), the naturally occurring -amino acids are often referred to
     as L amino acids. The nonnaturally occurring enantiomers are called D amino acids.

     The 20 common amino acids can be further classified as neutral, acidic, or basic, depending on the structure of
     their side chains. Fifteen of the twenty have neutral side chains, two (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) have an
     extra carboxylic acid function in their side chains, and three (lysine, arginine, and histidine) have basic amino
     groups in their side chains. Note that both cysteine (a thiol) and tyrosine (a phenol), although usually classified
     as neutral amino acids, nevertheless have weakly acidic side chains that can be deprotonated in a sufficiently
     basic solution.
     At the physiological pH of 7.3, the side-chain carboxyl groups of aspartic acid and glutamic acid are
     deprotonated and the basic side-chain nitrogens of lysine and arginine are protonated. Histidine, however,
     which contains a heterocyclic imidazole ring in its side chain, is not quite basic enough to be protonated at
     pH 7.3. Note that only the pyridine-like, doubly bonded nitrogen in histidine is basic. The pyrrole-like singly
     bonded nitrogen is nonbasic because its lone pair of electrons is part of the six--electron aromatic imidazole
     ring (Section 24.9).

     Humans are able to biosynthesize only 11 of the 20 protein amino acids, called nonessential amino acids.

The other 9, called essential amino acids, are biosynthesized only in plants and microorganisms and must be
obtained in our diet. The division between essential and nonessential amino acids is not clear-cut, however.
Tyrosine, for instance, is sometimes considered nonessential because humans can produce it from
phenylalanine, but phenylalanine itself is essential and must be obtained in the diet. Arginine can be
synthesized by humans, but much of the arginine we need also comes from our diet.

26.2 Amino Acids and the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation: Isoelectric
Points

According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (Section 20.3 and Section 24.5), if we know both the pH of a
solution and the pKa of an acid HA, we can calculate the ratio of [A-] to [HA] in the solution. Furthermore, when
pH = pKa, the two forms A- and HA are present in equal amounts because log 1 = 0.

                                                      

To apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to an amino acid, let's find out what species are present in a 1.00
M solution of alanine at pH = 9.00. According to TABLE 26.1, protonated alanine [+H3NCH(CH3)CO2H] has pKa1
= 2.34 and neutral zwitterionic alanine [+H3NCH(CH3)CO2-] has pKa2 = 9.69:

Because the pH of the solution is much closer to pKa2 than to pKa1, we need to use pKa2 for the calculation. From
the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we have:

So                         
In addition, we know that

Solving the two simultaneous equations gives [HA] = 0.83 and [A-] = 0.17. In other words, at pH = 9.00, 83% of
alanine molecules in a 1.00 M solution are neutral (zwitterionic) and 17% are deprotonated. Similar calculations
can be done at other pH values and the results plotted to give the titration curve shown in FIGURE 26.2.

Each leg of the titration curve is calculated separately. The first leg, from pH 1 to 6, corresponds to the
dissociation of protonated alanine, H2A+. The second leg, from pH 6 to 11, corresponds to the dissociation
of zwitterionic alanine, HA. It's as if we started with H2A+ at low pH and then titrated with NaOH. When 0.5
958  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     equivalent of NaOH is added, the deprotonation of H2A+ is 50% complete; when 1.0 equivalent of NaOH is
     added, the deprotonation of H2A+ is finished and HA predominates; when 1.5 equivalents of NaOH is added, the
     deprotonation of HA is 50% complete; and when 2.0 equivalents of NaOH is added, the deprotonation of HA is
     finished.

     FIGURE 26.2 A titration curve for alanine, plotted using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Each of the two legs is plotted separately.
     At pH < 1, alanine is entirely protonated; at pH = 2.34, alanine is a 50 : 50 mix of protonated and neutral forms; at pH = 6.01, alanine is
     entirely neutral; at pH = 9.69, alanine is a 50 : 50 mix of neutral and deprotonated forms; at pH > 11.5, alanine is entirely deprotonated.

     Look carefully at the titration curve in FIGURE 26.2. In acid solution, the amino acid is protonated and exists
     primarily as a cation. In basic solution, the amino acid is deprotonated and exists primarily as an anion. In
     between the two is an intermediate pH at which the amino acid is exactly balanced between anionic and cationic
     forms, existing primarily as the neutral, dipolar zwitterion. This pH is called the amino acid's isoelectric point
     (pI) and has a value of 6.01 for alanine.

     The isoelectric point of an amino acid depends on its structure, with values for the 20 common amino acids
     given previously in TABLE 26.1. The 15 neutral amino acids have isoelectric points near neutrality, in the pH
     range 5.0 to 6.5. The two acidic amino acids have isoelectric points at lower pH so that deprotonation of the
     side-chain -CO2H does not occur at their pI, and the three basic amino acids have isoelectric points at higher
     pH so that protonation of the side-chain amino group does not occur at their pI.
     More specifically, the pI of any amino acid is the average of the two acid-dissociation constants that involve the
     neutral zwitterion. For the 13 amino acids with a neutral side chain, pI is the average of pKa1 and pKa2. For the
     four amino acids with either a strongly or weakly acidic side chain, pI is the average of the two lowest pKa values.
     For the three amino acids with a basic side chain, pI is the average of the two highest pKa values.

Just as individual amino acids have isoelectric points, proteins have an overall pI due to the cumulative effect of
all the acidic or basic amino acids they may contain. The enzyme lysozyme, for instance, has a preponderance
of basic amino acids and thus has a high isoelectric point (pI = 11.0). Pepsin, however, has a preponderance
of acidic amino acids and a low isoelectric point (pI ~ 1.0). Not surprisingly, the solubilities and properties of
proteins with different pI's are strongly affected by the pH of the medium. Solubility in water is usually lowest at
the isoelectric point, where the protein has no net charge, and is higher both above and below the pI, where the
protein is charged.

We can take advantage of the differences in isoelectric points to separate a mixture of proteins into its pure
components. Using a technique known as electrophoresis, a mixture of proteins is placed near the center of
a strip of paper or gel. The paper or gel is moistened with an aqueous buffer of a given pH, and electrodes are
connected to the ends of the strip. When an electric potential is applied, the proteins with negative charges
(those that are deprotonated because the pH of the buffer is above their isoelectric point) migrate slowly toward
the positive electrode. At the same time, those amino acids with positive charges (those that are protonated
because the pH of the buffer is below their isoelectric point) migrate toward the negative electrode.

Different proteins migrate at different rates, depending on their isoelectric points and on the pH of the aqueous
buffer, thereby effecting a separation of the mixture into its components. FIGURE 26.3 illustrates this process
for a mixture containing basic, neutral, and acidic components.

FIGURE 26.3 Separation of a protein mixture by electrophoresis. At pH = 6.00, a neutral protein does not migrate, a basic protein is
protonated and migrates toward the negative electrode, and an acidic protein is deprotonated and migrates toward the positive electrode.

26.3 Synthesis of Amino Acids

-Amino acids can be synthesized in the laboratory using some of the reactions discussed in previous chapters.
One of the oldest methods of -amino acid synthesis begins with  bromination of a carboxylic acid by
treatment with Br2 and PBr3 (the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction; Section 22.4). SN2 substitution of the
-bromo acid with ammonia then yields an -amino acid.

     The Amidomalonate Synthesis

     A more general method for preparation of -amino acids is the amidomalonate synthesis, a straightforward
     extension of the malonic ester synthesis (Section 22.7). The reaction begins with the conversion of diethyl
     acetamidomalonate into an enolate ion by treatment with base, followed by SN2 alkylation with a primary
     alkyl halide. Hydrolysis of both the amide protecting group and the esters occurs when the alkylated product
     is warmed with aqueous acid, and decarboxylation then takes place to yield an -amino acid. For example,
     aspartic acid can be prepared from ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH2CO2Et:

     PROBLEM What alkyl halides would you use to prepare the following -amino acids by the amidomalonate
             26-6 method?
                      (a) Leucine (b) Histidine (c) Tryptophan (d) Methionine

     Reductive Amination of -Keto Acids

     Yet another method for the synthesis of -amino acids is by reductive amination of an -keto acid with
     ammonia and a reducing agent. Alanine, for instance, is prepared by treatment of pyruvic acid with ammonia
     in the presence of NaBH4. As described in Section 24.6, the reaction proceeds through formation of an
     intermediate imine which is then reduced.

     Enantioselective Synthesis

     The synthesis of an -amino acid from an achiral precursor by any of the methods just described yields a
     racemic mixture, with equal amounts of S and R enantiomers. To use an amino acid in the laboratory synthesis
     of a naturally occurring protein, however, the pure S enantiomer must be obtained.
     Two methods are used in practice to obtain enantiomerically pure amino acids. One way requires resolving
     the racemic mixture into its pure enantiomers (Section 5.8). A more direct approach, however, is to use an
     enantioselective synthesis to prepare only the desired S enantiomer directly. As discussed in the Chapter
     19 Chemistry Matters, the idea behind enantioselective synthesis is to find a chiral reaction catalyst that
     will temporarily hold a substrate molecule in an unsymmetrical, chiral environment. While in that chiral
     environment, the substrate may be more open to reaction on one side than on another, leading to an excess of
     one enantiomeric product.
     William Knowles at the Monsanto Company discovered in 1968 that -amino acids can be prepared
     enantioselectively by hydrogenation of a Z enamido acid with a chiral hydrogenation catalyst. (S)-
     Phenylalanine, for instance, is prepared at 98.7% purity, contaminated by only 1.3% of the (R) enantiomer, when
     using a chiral rhodium catalyst. For this discovery, Knowles shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

The most effective catalysts for enantioselective amino acid synthesis are coordination complexes of rhodium(I)
with 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) and a chiral diphosphine such as (R,R)-1,2-bis(o-anisylphenylphosphino)ethane,
the so-called DiPAMP ligand. This complex owes its chirality to the presence of trisubstituted phosphorus atoms
(Section 5.10).

PROBLEM Show how you could prepare the following amino acid enantioselectively:

26.4 Peptides and Proteins

Proteins and peptides are amino acid polymers in which the individual amino acids, called residues, are linked
together by amide bonds, or peptide bonds. An amino group from one residue forms an amide bond with the
carboxyl of a second residue, the amino group of the second forms an amide bond with the carboxyl of a third,
and so on. For example, alanylserine is the dipeptide that results when an amide bond forms between the
alanine carboxyl and the serine amino group.

Note that two dipeptides can result from reaction between alanine and serine, depending on which carboxyl
group reacts with which amino group. If the alanine amino group reacts with the serine carboxyl, serylalanine
results.
962  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     The long, repetitive sequence of -N-CH-CO- atoms that makes up a continuous chain is called the protein's
     backbone. By convention, peptides are written with the N-terminal amino acid (the one with the free -NH3+
     group) on the left and the C-terminal amino acid (the one with the free -CO2- group) on the right. The name
     of a peptide is denoted by the abbreviations listed in TABLE 26.1 for each amino acid. Thus, alanylserine is

     abbreviated Ala-Ser or A-S, and serylalanine is abbreviated Ser-Ala or S-A. The one-letter abbreviations are

     more convenient, though less immediately recognizable, than the three-letter abbreviations.

     The amide bond that links amino acids together in peptides is no different from any other amide bond (Section

     24.3). An amide nitrogen is nonbasic because its unshared electron pair is delocalized by resonance with the

     carbonyl group. This overlap of the nitrogen p orbital with the p orbitals of the carbonyl group imparts a certain

     amount of double-bond character to the C-N bond and restricts rotation around it. The amide bond is therefore

     planar, and the N-H is oriented 180° to the             .

     A second kind of covalent bonding in peptides occurs when a disulfide linkage, RS-SR, is formed between two
     cysteine residues. As we saw in Section 18.7, a disulfide is formed by mild oxidation of a thiol, RSH, and is
     cleaved by mild reduction.

     A disulfide bond between cysteine residues in different peptide chains links the otherwise separate chains
     together, whereas a disulfide bond between cysteine residues in the same chain forms a loop. Insulin, for
     instance, is composed of two chains that total 51 amino acids and are linked by two cysteine disulfide bridges.

26.5 Amino Acid Analysis of Peptides

To determine the structure of a protein or peptide, we need to answer three questions: What amino acids are
present? How much of each is present? In what sequence do the amino acids occur in the peptide chain? The
answers to the first two questions are provided by an automated instrument called an amino acid analyzer.
An amino acid analyzer is based on techniques worked out in the 1950s by William Stein and Stanford Moore
at the Rockefeller University, who shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work. In preparation for
analysis, the peptide is broken into its constituent amino acids by reducing all disulfide bonds, capping the
-SH groups of cysteine residues by SN2 reaction with iodoacetic acid, and hydrolyzing the amide bonds by
heating with aqueous 6 M HCl at 110 °C for 24 hours. The resultant amino acid mixture is then separated into
its components by a technique called chromatography, either high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or
ion-exchange chromatography.
In both HPLC and ion-exchange chromatography, the mixture to be separated is dissolved in a solvent, called
the mobile phase, and passed through a metal tube or glass column that contains an adsorbent material, called
the stationary phase. Because different compounds adsorb to the stationary phase to different extents, they
migrate through the chromatography column at different rates and are separated as they emerge (elute) from
the end.
In the ion-exchange technique, separated amino acids eluting from the chromatography column mix with a
solution of a substance called ninhydrin and undergo a rapid reaction that produces an intense purple color.
The color is measured by a spectrometer, and a plot of elution time versus spectrometer absorbance is obtained.

Because the time required for a given amino acid to elute from a standard column is reproducible, the identities
of the amino acids in a peptide can be determined. The amount of each amino acid in the sample is determined
by measuring the intensity of the purple color resulting from its reaction with ninhydrin. FIGURE 26.4 shows
the results of amino acid analysis of a standard equimolar mixture of 17 -amino acids. Typically, amino acid
analysis requires about 100 picomoles (2-3 g) of sample for a protein containing about 200 residues.

     26.6 Peptide Sequencing: The Edman Degradation

     With the identities and relative amounts of amino acids known, a peptide can then be sequenced to find out
     in what order the amino acids are linked. Much peptide sequencing is now done by mass spectrometry, using
     either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) linked to a time-of-
     flight (TOF) mass analyzer, as described in Section 12.4. Also in common use is a chemical method of peptide
     sequencing called the Edman degradation.

     The general idea of peptide sequencing by Edman degradation is to cleave one amino acid at a time from an
     end of the peptide chain. That terminal amino acid is then separated and identified, and the cleavage reactions
     are repeated on the chain-shortened peptide until the entire peptide sequence is known. Automated protein
     sequencers are available that allow as many as 50 repetitive sequencing cycles to be carried out before a
     buildup of unwanted by-products interferes with the results. So efficient are these instruments that sequence
     information can be obtained from as little as 1 to 5 picomoles of sample--less than 0.1 g.

     As shown in FIGURE 26.5, Edman degradation involves treatment of a peptide with phenyl isothiocyanate

     (PITC),             , followed by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid. The first step attaches the PITC to the

     -NH2 group of the N-terminal amino acid, and the second step splits the N-terminal residue from the peptide

     chain, yielding an anilinothiazolinone (ATZ) derivative plus the chain-shortened peptide. Further acid-

     catalyzed rearrangement of the ATZ derivative with aqueous acid converts it into a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH),

     which is identified by comparison of its elution time with the known elution times of PTH derivatives of the

     20 common amino acids. The chain-shortened peptide is then automatically resubmitted for another round of

     Edman degradation.

FIGURE 26.5 MECHANISM
Mechanism of the Edman degradation for N-terminal analysis of peptides.

Complete sequencing of large proteins by Edman degradation is impractical because of the buildup of unwanted
by-products. To get around this problem, a large peptide chain is first cleaved by partial hydrolysis into a
number of smaller fragments, the sequence of each fragment is determined, and the individual fragments are
966  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     fitted together by matching their overlapping ends. In this way, protein chains with more than 400 amino acids
     have been sequenced.

     Partial hydrolysis of a peptide can be carried out either chemically with aqueous acid or enzymatically. Acid
     hydrolysis is unselective and gives a more-or-less random mixture of small fragments, but enzymatic
     hydrolysis is quite specific. The enzyme trypsin, for instance, catalyzes hydrolysis of peptides only at the
     carboxyl side of the basic amino acids arginine and lysine; chymotrypsin cleaves only at the carboxyl side of the
     aryl-substituted amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.

     26.7 Peptide Synthesis

     Once the structure of a peptide is known, its synthesis can be undertaken--perhaps to obtain a larger amount
     for biological evaluation. A simple amide might be formed by treating an amine and a carboxylic acid with a
     carbodiimide (either DCC or EDC; Section 21.3), but peptide synthesis is a more difficult problem because many
     different amide bonds must be formed in a specific order, rather than at random.

     The solution to the specificity problem is protection (Section 17.8). If we want to couple alanine with leucine to
     synthesize Ala-Leu, for instance, we could protect the -NH2 group of alanine and the -CO2H group of leucine to
     shield them from reacting, then form the desired Ala-Leu amide bond by reaction with EDC or DCC, and then
     remove the protecting groups.

A number of different amino- and carboxyl-protecting groups have been devised, but only a few are used in

peptide synthesis. Carboxyl groups are often protected simply by converting them into methyl or benzyl esters.

Both groups are easily introduced by standard methods of ester formation (Section 21.6) and are easily removed

by mild hydrolysis with aqueous NaOH. Benzyl esters can also be cleaved by catalytic hydrogenolysis of the

weak benzylic C-O bond (  ).

Amino groups are sometimes protected as their tert-butyloxycarbonyl amide (Boc) or, more commonly, as
their fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl amide (Fmoc). The Boc protecting group is introduced by reaction of the
amino acid with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction and is removed by brief
treatment with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, CF3CO2H. The Fmoc protecting group is introduced
by reaction with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride and is removed by treatment with a 20% solution of the
amine piperidine in dimethylformamide as solvent.

     Thus, five steps are needed to synthesize a dipeptide such as Ala-Leu:

     These steps can be repeated to add one amino acid at a time to the growing chain or to link two peptide
     chains together. Many remarkable achievements in peptide synthesis have been reported, including a complete
     synthesis of human insulin. Insulin is composed of two chains totaling 51 amino acids linked by two disulfide
     bridges. The three-dimensional structure of insulin, shown previously, was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot
     Hodgkin, a British chemist who received the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on this and other
     complex biological molecules.

26.8 Automated Peptide Synthesis: The Merrifield Solid-Phase Method

As you might imagine, the synthesis of a large peptide chain by sequential addition of one amino acid at a time
is a long and arduous process. An immense simplification is possible, however, using methods introduced by R.
Bruce Merrifield, who received the 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the Merrifield solid-phase method, peptide
synthesis is carried out with the growing amino acid chain covalently bonded to small beads of a polymer resin,
rather than in solution.

In the original procedure, polystyrene resin was used, prepared so that one of every hundred or so benzene
rings contained a chloromethyl (-CH2Cl) group. A Boc-protected C-terminal amino acid was then attached to
the resin through an ester bond formed by SN2 reaction.

With the first amino acid bonded to the resin, a repeating series of four steps is then carried out to build a
peptide.
970  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     The steps in the solid-phase procedure have been improved substantially over the years, but the fundamental
     idea remains the same. A common procedure is use of the Wang resin, developed by Su-Sun Wang, with the
     Fmoc protecting group. Less common is using the PAM (phenylacetamidomethyl) resin with Boc as the N-
     protecting group.

Robotic peptide synthesizers are now used to automatically repeat the coupling, washing, and deprotection
steps with different amino acids. Each step occurs in high yield, and mechanical losses are minimized because
the peptide intermediates are never removed from the insoluble polymer until the final step. Peptides with 20
amino acids can be routinely prepared in a few hours.

26.9 Protein Structure

Proteins are usually classified as either fibrous or globular, according to their three-dimensional shape. Fibrous
proteins, such as the collagen in tendons and connective tissue and the myosin in muscle tissue, consist of
polypeptide chains arranged side by side in long filaments. Because these proteins are tough and insoluble in
water, they are used in nature for structural materials. Globular proteins, by contrast, are usually coiled into
compact, roughly spherical shapes. These proteins are generally soluble in water and are mobile within cells.
Most of the more than 3000 or so enzymes that have been characterized are globular proteins, including the
1300 different enzymes in the human body.

Proteins are so large that the word structure takes on a broader meaning than with simpler organic compounds.
In fact, chemists speak of four different levels of structure when describing proteins.

· The primary structure of a protein is simply the amino acid sequence.
· The secondary structure of a protein describes how segments of the peptide backbone orient into a regular

   pattern.
· The tertiary structure describes how the entire protein molecule coils into an overall three-dimensional

   shape.
· The quaternary structure describes how different protein molecules come together to yield large

   aggregate structures.

Primary structure is determined, as we've seen, by sequencing the protein. Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
structures are determined either by NMR or by X-ray crystallography (Chapter 12 Chemistry Matters).

The most common secondary structures are the  helix and the -pleated sheet. An  helix is a right-handed

coil of the protein backbone, much like the coil of a spiral staircase (FIGURE 26.6a). Each turn of the helix

contains 3.6 amino acid residues, with a distance between coils of 540 pm, or 5.4 Å. The structure is stabilized

by hydrogen bonds between amide N-H groups and  groups four residues away, with an N-H····O distance

of 2.8 Å. The  helix is an extremely common secondary structure, and nearly all globular proteins contain

many helical segments. Myoglobin, a small globular protein containing 153 amino acid residues in a single

chain, is one example (FIGURE 26.6b).

A -pleated sheet differs from an  helix in that the peptide chain is fully extended rather than coiled and
the hydrogen bonds occur between residues in adjacent chains (FIGURE 26.7a). The neighboring chains can
run either in the same direction (parallel) or in opposite directions (antiparallel), although the antiparallel
arrangement is more common and somewhat more energetically favorable. Concanavalin A, for instance,
972  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     consists of two identical chains of 237 residues, with extensive regions of antiparallel  sheets (FIGURE 26.7b).

     FIGURE 26.6 (a) The -helical secondary structure of proteins is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the N-H group of one residue and

     the  group four residues away. (b) The structure of myoglobin, a globular protein with extensive helical regions that are shown as coiled

     ribbons in this representation.

     (b) The structure of concanavalin A, a protein with extensive regions of antiparallel  sheets, shown as flat ribbons.

     What about tertiary structure? Why does a protein adopt the shape it does? The forces that determine the
     tertiary structure of a protein are the same forces that act on all molecules, regardless of size, to provide
     maximum stability. Particularly important are the hydrophilic (water-loving; Section 2.12) interactions of the
     polar side chains on acidic or basic amino acids and the hydrophobic (water-fearing) interactions of nonpolar

     Access for free at openstax.org
26.10 · Enzymes and Coenzymes                                                                                                    973

side chains. These acidic or basic amino acids with charged side chains tend to congregate on the exterior of the
protein, where they can be solvated by water. Amino acids with neutral, nonpolar side chains tend to congregate
on the hydrocarbon-like interior of a protein molecule, away from the aqueous medium.

Also important for stabilizing a protein's tertiary structure are the formation of disulfide bridges between
cysteine residues, the formation of hydrogen bonds between nearby amino acid residues, and the presence of
ionic attractions, called salt bridges, between positively and negatively charged sites on various amino acid side
chains within the protein.

Because the tertiary structure of a globular protein is delicately maintained by weak intramolecular attractions,
a modest change in temperature or pH is often enough to disrupt that structure and cause the protein to become
denatured. Denaturation occurs under such mild conditions that the primary structure remains intact, but the
tertiary structure unfolds from a specific globular shape to a randomly looped chain (FIGURE 26.8).

FIGURE 26.8 A representation of protein denaturation. A globular protein loses its specific three-dimensional shape and becomes
randomly looped.

Denaturation is accompanied by changes in both physical and biological properties. Solubility is drastically
decreased, as occurs when egg white is cooked and the albumins unfold and coagulate. Most enzymes lose
all catalytic activity when denatured, since a precisely defined tertiary structure is required for their action.
Although most denaturation is irreversible, some cases are known where spontaneous renaturation of an
unfolded protein to its stable tertiary structure occurs, accompanied by a full recovery of biological activity.

26.10 Enzymes and Coenzymes

An enzyme is a substance--usually a large protein--that acts as a catalyst for a biological reaction. Like all
catalysts, an enzyme doesn't affect the equilibrium constant of a reaction and can't bring about a chemical
change that is otherwise unfavorable. An enzyme acts only to lower the activation energy for a reaction, thereby
making the reaction take place more rapidly than it otherwise would. Sometimes, in fact, the rate acceleration
brought about by enzymes is extraordinary. Millionfold rate increases are common, and the glycosidase
enzymes that hydrolyze polysaccharides increase the reaction rate by a factor of more than 1017, changing the
time required for the reaction from millions of years to milliseconds!

Unlike many of the catalysts that chemists use in the laboratory, enzymes are usually specific in their action.
Often, in fact, an enzyme will catalyze only a single reaction of a single compound, called the enzyme's
substrate. For example, the enzyme amylase, found in the human digestive tract, catalyzes only the hydrolysis
of starch to yield glucose; cellulose and other polysaccharides are untouched by amylase.

Different enzymes have different specificities. Some, such as amylase, are specific for a single substrate, but
others operate on a range of substrates. Papain, for instance, a globular protein of 212 amino acids isolated
from papaya fruit, catalyzes the hydrolysis of many kinds of peptide bonds. In fact, it's this ability to hydrolyze
peptide bonds that makes papain useful as a cleaner for contact lenses.

Enzymes function through a pathway that involves initial formation of an enzyme-substrate complex (E · S),
followed by a multistep chemical conversion of the enzyme-bound substrate into enzyme-bound product (E · P)
974  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     and final release of product from the complex.

     The overall rate constant for conversion of the E · S complex to products E · P is called the turnover number
     because it represents the number of substrate molecules a single enzyme molecule turns over into product per
     unit time. A value of about 103 per second is typical, although carbonic anhydrase can reach a value of up to
     600,000.

     The extraordinary rate accelerations achieved by enzymes are due to a combination of several factors. One
     important factor is simple geometry: an enzyme will adjust its shape to hold the substrate, other reactants,
     and various catalytic sites on acidic or basic residues in the precise geometry needed for reaction. In addition,
     the wrapping of the enzyme around the substrate can create specialized microenvironments that protect the
     substrate from the aqueous medium and can dramatically change the behavior of acid-base catalytic residues
     in the active site. But perhaps most important is that the enzyme stabilizes and thus lowers the energy of the
     rate-limiting transition state for reaction. That is, it's not the ability of the enzyme to bind the substrate that
     matters but rather its ability to bind and stabilize the transition state. Often, in fact, the enzyme binds the
     transition structure as much as 1012 times more tightly than it binds the substrate or products. An energy
     diagram for an enzyme-catalyzed process might resemble that in FIGURE 26.9.

     FIGURE 26.9 Energy diagrams for uncatalyzed and enzyme-catalyzed processes. The enzyme makes available an alternative, lower-
     energy pathway. Rate enhancement is due to the ability of the enzyme to bind to the transition state for product formation, thereby lowering
     its energy.

     Enzymes are classified into six categories depending on the kind of reaction they catalyze, as shown in TABLE
     26.2. Oxidoreductases catalyze oxidations and reductions; transferases catalyze the transfer of a group from
     one substrate to another; hydrolases catalyze hydrolysis reactions of esters, amides, and related substrates;
     lyases catalyze the elimination or addition of a small molecule such as H2O from or to a substrate; isomerases
     catalyze isomerizations; and ligases catalyze the bonding of two molecules, often coupled with the hydrolysis of
     ATP. The systematic name of an enzyme has two parts, ending with -ase. The first part identifies the enzyme's
     substrate, and the second part identifies its class. Hexose kinase, for example, is a transferase that catalyzes the
     transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a hexose sugar.

In addition to their protein part, most enzymes also contain a small non-protein part called a cofactor. A
cofactor can be either an inorganic ion, such as Zn2+, or a small organic molecule, called a coenzyme. A
coenzyme is not a catalyst but is a reactant that undergoes chemical change during the reaction and requires
an additional step to return to its initial state.

Many coenzymes are derived from vitamins--substances that an organism requires in small amounts for
growth but is unable to synthesize and must receive in its diet (Chapter 20 Chemistry Matters). Coenzyme A
from pantothenate (vitamin B3), NAD+ from niacin, FAD from riboflavin (vitamin B2), tetrahydrofolate from folic
acid, pyridoxal phosphate from pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and thiamin diphosphate from thiamin (vitamin B1)
are examples. TABLE 26.3 shows the structures of some common coenzymes.

26.11 How Do Enzymes Work? Citrate Synthase

As we saw in the previous section, enzymes work by bringing substrate and other reactant molecules together,
holding them in the orientation necessary for reaction, providing any necessary acidic or basic sites to catalyze
specific steps, and stabilizing the transition state for reaction. As an example, let's look at citrate synthase, an
enzyme that catalyzes the aldol-like addition of acetyl CoA to oxaloacetate to give citrate. This reaction is the first
step in the citric acid cycle, in which acetyl groups produced by degradation of food molecules are metabolized
to yield CO2 and H2O. We'll look at the details of the citric acid cycle in Section 29.7.
976  26 · Biomolecules: Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins

     Citrate synthase is a globular protein of 433 amino acids with a deep cleft lined by an array of functional groups
     that can bind to the substrate, oxaloacetate. On binding oxaloacetate, the original cleft closes and another opens
     up nearby to bind acetyl CoA. This second cleft is also lined by appropriate functional groups, including a
     histidine at position 274 and an aspartic acid at position 375. The two reactants are now held by the enzyme
     in close proximity and with a suitable orientation for reaction. FIGURE 26.10 shows the structure of citrate

the -helical segments of the protein chain and indicates that the enzyme is dimeric; that is, it consists of two identical chains held together
by hydrogen bonds and other intermolecular attractions. Part (c) is a close-up of the active site in which oxaloacetate and an unreactive
acetyl CoA mimic are bound.

As shown in FIGURE 26.11, the first step in the aldol reaction of acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate is generation of
the enol of acetyl CoA. The side-chain carboxyl of an aspartate residue acts as base to abstract an acidic 
proton, while at the same time the side-chain imidazole ring of a histidine donates H+ to the carbonyl oxygen.
The enol thus produced then performs a nucleophilic addition to the ketone carbonyl group of oxaloacetate.
The first histidine acts as a base to remove the -OH hydrogen from the enol, while a second histidine residue
simultaneously donates a proton to the oxaloacetate carbonyl group, giving citryl CoA. Water then hydrolyzes
the thiol ester group in citryl CoA in a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, releasing citrate and coenzyme A
as the final products.

The Protein Data Bank

Enzymes are so large, so structurally complex, and so numerous that the use of computer databases and
molecular visualization programs has become an essential tool for studying biological chemistry. Of the various
databases available online, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html), maintained by the Kanehisa Laboratory of Kyoto University
Bioinformatics Center, is useful for obtaining information on biosynthetic pathways of the sort we'll be
describing in Chapter 29. For obtaining information on a specific enzyme, the BRENDA database
(http://www.brenda-enzymes.org), maintained by the Institute of Biochemistry at the University of Cologne,
Germany, is particularly valuable.
Perhaps the most useful of all biological databases is the Protein Data Bank (PDB), operated by the Research
Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB). The PDB is a worldwide repository of X-ray and NMR
structural data for biological macromolecules. In mid-2022, data for more than 192,888 structures were
available, and more than 7000 new ones were being added yearly. To access the Protein Data Bank, go to
www.rcsb.org and a home page like that shown in FIGURE 26.12 will appear. As with much that is available
online, however, the PDB site is changing rapidly, so you may not see quite the same thing.

Summary

Proteins and peptides are large biomolecules made of -amino acid residues linked together by amide,
or peptide, bonds. Twenty amino acids are commonly found in proteins, and all except glycine have
stereochemistry similar to that of L sugars. In neutral solution, amino acids exist as dipolar zwitterions.

Amino acids can be synthesized in racemic form by several methods, including ammonolysis of an -bromo
acid, alkylation of diethyl acetamidomalonate, and reductive amination of an -keto acid. Alternatively, an

enantioselective synthesis of amino acids can be carried out using a chiral hydrogenation catalyst.

Determining the structure of a peptide or protein begins with amino acid analysis. The peptide is hydrolyzed
to its constituent -amino acids, which are separated and identified. Next, the peptide is sequenced. Edman
degradation by treatment with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) cleaves one residue from the N terminus of the
peptide and forms an easily identifiable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative of the N-terminal amino acid.
An automated series of Edman degradations can sequence peptide chains up to 50 residues in length.

Peptide synthesis involves the use of protecting groups. An N-protected amino acid with a free -CO2H group
is coupled using DCC or EDC to an O-protected amino acid with a free -NH2 group. Amide formation occurs,
the protecting groups are removed, and the sequence is repeated. Amines are usually protected as their
tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) derivatives; acids are usually protected as
esters. The synthesis is often carried out by the Merrifield solid-phase method, in which the peptide is bonded
to insoluble polymer beads.

Proteins have four levels of structure. Primary structure describes a protein's amino acid sequence; secondary
structure describes how segments of the protein chain orient into regular patterns--either  helix or -pleated
sheet; tertiary structure describes how the entire protein molecule coils into an overall three-dimensional
shape; and quaternary structure describes how individual protein molecules aggregate into larger structures.
Proteins are classified as either globular or fibrous. Fibrous proteins such as -keratin are tough, rigid, and
water-insoluble; globular proteins such as myoglobin are water-soluble and roughly spherical in shape. Many
globular proteins are enzymes--substances that act as catalysts for biological reactions. Enzymes are grouped
into six classes according to the kind of reaction they catalyze. In addition to their protein part, many enzymes
contain cofactors, which can be either metal ions or small organic molecules called coenzymes.

27.6 Steroids
27.7 Biosynthesis of Steroids

WHY THIS CHAPTER? We've now covered two of the four major classes of biomolecules--proteins and
carbohydrates--and have two remaining. In this chapter, we'll cover lipids, the largest and most diverse class of
biomolecules, looking both at their structure and function and at their metabolism.
Lipids are naturally occurring organic molecules that have limited solubility in water and can be isolated from
organisms by extraction with nonpolar organic solvents. Fats, oils, waxes, many vitamins and hormones, and
most nonprotein cell-membrane components are some examples. Note that this definition differs from the sort
used for carbohydrates and proteins in that lipids are defined by a physical property (solubility) rather than
by structure. Of the many kinds of lipids, we'll be concerned in this chapter with only a few: triacylglycerols,
eicosanoids, terpenoids, and steroids.
Lipids are classified into two broad types: those like fats and waxes, which contain ester linkages and can
be hydrolyzed, and those like cholesterol and other steroids, which don't have ester linkages and can't be
hydrolyzed.

     27.1 Waxes, Fats, and Oils

     Waxes are mixtures of esters of long-chain carboxylic acids with long-chain alcohols. The carboxylic acid
     usually has an even number of carbons from 16 to 36, while the alcohol has an even number of carbons from
     24 to 36. One of the major components of beeswax, for instance, is triacontyl hexadecanoate, the ester of the
     C30 alcohol (1-triacontanol) and the C16 acid (hexadecanoic acid). The waxy protective coatings on most fruits,
     berries, leaves, and animal furs have similar structures.

     Animal fats and vegetable oils are the most widely occurring lipids. Although they appear different--animal fats
     like butter and lard are solids, whereas vegetable oils like corn and peanut oil are liquid--their structures are
     closely related. Chemically, fats and oils are triglycerides, or triacylglycerols--triesters of glycerol with three
     long-chain carboxylic acids called fatty acids. Animals use fats for long-term energy storage because they are
     far less highly oxidized than carbohydrates and provide about six times as much energy as an equal weight of
     stored, hydrated glycogen.

     Hydrolysis of a fat or oil with aqueous NaOH yields glycerol and three fatty acids. The fatty acids are generally
     unbranched and contain an even number of carbon atoms between 12 and 20. If double bonds are present,
     they have mostly, although not entirely, Z, or cis, geometry. The three fatty acids of a specific triacylglycerol
     molecule need not be the same, and the fat or oil from a given source is likely to be a complex mixture of many
     different triacylglycerols. TABLE 27.1 lists some of the commonly occurring fatty acids, and TABLE 27.2 lists the
     approximate composition of fats and oils from different sources.

     More than 100 different fatty acids are known and about 40 occur widely. Palmitic acid (C16) and stearic acid
     (C18) are the most abundant saturated fatty acids; oleic and linoleic acids (both C18) are the most abundant
     unsaturated ones. Oleic acid is monounsaturated because it has only one double bond, whereas linoleic,
     linolenic, and arachidonic acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids because they have more than one double
     bond. Linoleic and linolenic acids occur in cream and are essential in the human diet; infants grow poorly and
     develop skin lesions if fed a diet of nonfat milk for prolonged periods. Linolenic acid, in particular, is an example
     of an omega-3 fatty acid, which has been found to lower blood triglyceride levels and reduce the risk of heart
     attack. The name omega-3 means that there is a double bond three carbons in from the noncarboxyl end of the
     chain.

     The data in TABLE 27.1 show that unsaturated fatty acids generally have lower melting points than their

     saturated counterparts, a trend that is also true for triacylglycerols. Since vegetable oils generally have a higher

     proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids than animal fats (TABLE 27.2), they have lower melting points.

     The difference is a consequence of structure. Saturated fats have a uniform shape that allows them to pack

     together efficiently in a crystal lattice. In unsaturated vegetable oils, however, the  bonds introduce bends

     and kinks into the hydrocarbon chains, making crystal formation more difficult. The more double bonds there

     are, the harder it is for the molecules to crystallize and the lower the melting point of the oil.

     The  bonds in vegetable oils can be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation, typically carried out at high

     temperature using a nickel catalyst, to produce saturated solid or semisolid fats. Prior to 2015, industrially

     produced margarine and shortening were produced by hydrogenating soybean, peanut, or cottonseed oil until

     the proper consistency is obtained. As of 2015, trans fats are no longer considered safe by the FDA and

     have since been phased out of industrially produced foods. Unfortunately, the hydrogenation reaction is

     accompanied by some cis-trans isomerization of the remaining double bonds, producing fats with about 10%

     to 15% trans unsaturated fatty acids. Dietary intake of trans fatty acids increases cholesterol levels in the blood,

     thereby increasing the risk of heart problems. The conversion of linoleic acid into elaidic acid is an example.

27.2 Soap

Soap has been in use for nearly 5000 years. As early as 2800 BC, the Babylonians boiled fats with ashes to create
a soap-like substance. Ancient Egyptian medical papyri dating from 1550 BC reveals that Egyptians bathed
regularly with soap made from a mixture of animal fats, vegetable oils, and alkaline salts. Chemically, soap is a
mixture of the sodium or potassium salts of the long-chain fatty acids produced by hydrolysis (saponification)
of animal fat with alkali. Wood ash was used as a source of alkali until the early 1800s, when the LeBlanc process
for making Na2CO3 by heating sodium sulfate with limestone became available.

Crude soap curds contain glycerol and excess alkali as well as soap but can be purified by boiling with water
and adding NaCl or KCl to precipitate the pure carboxylate salts. The smooth soap that precipitates is dried,
perfumed, and pressed into bars for household use. Dyes are added to make colored soaps, antiseptics are
added for medicated soaps, pumice is added for scouring soaps, and air is blown in for soaps that float.
Regardless of these extra treatments and regardless of price, though, all soaps are basically the same.
Soaps act as cleansers because the two ends of a soap molecule are so different. The carboxylate end of the long-
chain molecule is ionic and therefore hydrophilic (Section 2.12), or attracted to water. The long hydrocarbon
portion of the molecule, however, is nonpolar and hydrophobic, avoiding water and therefore more soluble in
oils. The net effect of these two opposing tendencies is that soaps are attracted to both oils and water and are
therefore useful as cleansers.
When soaps are dispersed in water, the long hydrocarbon tails cluster together on the inside of a tangled,
hydrophobic ball, while the ionic heads on the surface of the cluster protrude into the water layer. These
spherical clusters, called micelles, are shown schematically in FIGURE 27.2. Grease and oil droplets are
solubilized in water when they are coated by the nonpolar, hydrophobic tails of soap molecules in the center of
micelles. Once solubilized, the grease and dirt can be rinsed away.

     As useful as they are, soaps also have drawbacks. In hard water, which contains metal ions, soluble sodium
     carboxylates are converted into insoluble magnesium and calcium salts, leaving the familiar ring of scum
     around bathtubs and a gray tinge on white clothes. Chemists have circumvented this problem by synthesizing
     a class of synthetic detergents based on salts of long-chain alkylbenzenesulfonic acids. The mechanism of
     synthetic detergents is the same as that of soaps: the alkylbenzene end of the molecule is attracted to grease,
     while the anionic sulfonate end is attracted to water. Unlike soaps, though, sulfonate detergents don't form
     insoluble metal salts in hard water and don't leave an unpleasant scum.

     27.3 Phospholipids

     Just as waxes, fats, and oils are esters of carboxylic acids, phospholipids are esters of phosphoric acid, H3PO4.

     Phospholipids are of two general types: glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. Glycerophospholipids are
     based on phosphatidic acid, which contains a glycerol backbone linked by ester bonds to two fatty acids and one
     phosphoric acid. Although the fatty-acid residues can be any of the C12-C20 units typically present in fats, the
     acyl group at C1 is usually saturated and the one at C2 is usually unsaturated. The phosphate group at C3 is also

bonded to an amino alcohol such as choline [HOCH2CH2N(CH3)3]+, ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2), or serine
[HOCH2CH(NH2)CO2H]. The compounds are chiral and have an L, or R, configuration at C2.

Sphingomyelins are the second major group of phospholipids. These compounds have sphingosine or a related
dihydroxyamine as their backbone and are particularly abundant in brain and nerve tissue, where they are a
major constituent of the coating around nerve fibers.

Phospholipids are found widely in both plant and animal tissues and make up approximately 50% to 60% of
cell membranes. Because they are like soaps in having a long, nonpolar hydrocarbon tail bound to a polar ionic
head, phospholipids in the cell membrane organize into a lipid bilayer about 5.0 nm (50 Å) thick. As shown
in FIGURE 27.3, the nonpolar tails aggregate in the center of the bilayer in much the same way that soap tails
aggregate in the center of a micelle. This bilayer serves as an effective barrier to the passage of water, ions, and
other components into and out of cells.

27.4 Prostaglandins and Other Eicosanoids

Prostaglandins are a group of C20 lipids that contain a five-membered ring with two long side chains. First
isolated in the 1930s by Ulf von Euler at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, much of the structural and chemical
998  27 · Biomolecules: Lipids

     work on prostaglandins was carried out by Sune Bergström and Bengt Samuelsson. All three shared Nobel
     Prizes for their work. The name prostaglandin derives from the fact that the compounds were first isolated from
     sheep prostate glands, but they have subsequently been found to be present in small amounts in all body tissues
     and fluids.

     The several dozen known prostaglandins have an extraordinarily wide range of biological effects. Among their
     many properties, they can lower blood pressure, affect blood platelet aggregation during clotting, lower gastric
     secretions, control inflammation, affect kidney function, affect reproductive systems, and stimulate uterine
     contractions during childbirth.

     Prostaglandins, together with related compounds called thromboxanes and leukotrienes, make up a class of
     compounds called eicosanoids because they are derived biologically from 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid,
     or arachidonic acid (FIGURE 27.4). Prostaglandins (PG) have a cyclopentane ring with two long side chains;
     thromboxanes (TX) have a six-membered, oxygen-containing ring; and leukotrienes (LT) are acyclic.

                     FIGURE 27.4 Structures of some representative eicosanoids. All are derived biologically from arachidonic acid.

     Eicosanoids are named based on their ring system (PG, TX, or LT), substitution pattern, and number of double
     bonds. The various substitution patterns on the ring are indicated by letter as in FIGURE 27.5, and the number
     of double bonds is indicated by a subscript. Thus, PGE1 is a prostaglandin with the "E" substitution pattern and
     one double bond. The numbering of the atoms in the various eicosanoids is the same as in arachidonic acid,
     starting with the -CO2H carbon as C1, continuing around the ring, and ending with the -CH3 carbon at the other
     end of the chain as C20.

Eicosanoid biosynthesis begins with the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2, catalyzed by the
multifunctional PGH synthase (PGHS), also called cyclooxygenase (COX). There are two distinct enzymes,
PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (or COX-1 and COX-2), both of which accomplish the same reaction but appear to function
independently. COX-1 carries out the normal physiological production of prostaglandins, and COX-2 produces
additional prostaglandin in response to arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Vioxx, Bextra, and several
other drugs selectively inhibit the COX-2 enzyme but cause potentially serious heart and gastrointestinal
problems in weakened patients. (See the Chapter 15 Chemistry Matters.)

PGHS accomplishes two transformations, an initial reaction of arachidonic acid with O2 to yield PGG2 and a
subsequent reduction of the hydroperoxide group (-OOH) to the alcohol PGH2. The sequence of steps involved
in these transformations was shown in FIGURE 8.12.

Further processing of PGH2 leads to other eicosanoids. PGE2, for instance, arises by an isomerization of PGH2
catalyzed by PGE synthase (PGES) (FIGURE 27.6).

      27.5 Terpenoids

      We saw in the Chapter 8 Chemistry Matters that terpenoids are a vast and diverse group of lipids found in
      all living organisms. Despite their apparent structural differences, all terpenoids contain a multiple of five
      carbons and are derived biosynthetically from the five-carbon precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (FIGURE
      27.7). Although formally a terpenoid contains oxygen, while a hydrocarbon is called a terpene, we'll use the term
      terpenoid to refer to both for simplicity.

You might recall from the chapter on Alkenes: Reactions and Synthesis that terpenoids are classified according
to the number of five-carbon multiples they contain. Monoterpenoids contain 10 carbons and are derived from
two isopentenyl diphosphates, sesquiterpenoids contain 15 carbons and are derived from three isopentenyl
diphosphates, diterpenoids contain 20 carbons and are derived from four isopentenyl diphosphates, and so on,
up to triterpenoids (C30) and tetraterpenoids (C40). Lanosterol, for instance, is a triterpenoid from which steroid
hormones are made, and -carotene is a tetraterpenoid that serves as a dietary source of vitamin A (FIGURE
27.7).

The terpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate, formerly called isopentenyl pyrophosphate and thus
abbreviated IPP, is biosynthesized by two different pathways, depending on the organism and the structure of
the final product. In animals and higher plants, sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids arise primarily from the
mevalonate pathway, whereas monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and tetraterpenoids are biosynthesized by the
1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, also called the methylerithritol phosphate, or MEP, pathway. In
bacteria, both pathways are used. We'll look only at the mevalonate pathway, which is more common and better
understood at present.

      The Mevalonate Pathway to Isopentenyl Diphosphate

      As shown in FIGURE 27.8, the mevalonate pathway begins with the conversion of acetate to acetyl CoA, followed
      by Claisen condensation to yield acetoacetyl CoA. A second carbonyl condensation reaction with a third
      molecule of acetyl CoA, this one an aldol-like process, then yields the six-carbon compound
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA, which is reduced to give mevalonate. Phosphorylation, followed by loss of CO2
      and phosphate ion, completes the process.
      Step 1 of FIGURE 27.8: Claisen Condensation
      The first step in mevalonate biosynthesis is a Claisen condensation to yield acetoacetyl CoA, a reaction catalyzed
      by acetoacetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. An acetyl group is first bound to the enzyme by a nucleophilic acyl
      substitution reaction with a cysteine -SH group. Formation of an enolate ion from a second molecule of acetyl
      CoA, followed by Claisen condensation, then yields the product.

      Step 2 of FIGURE 27.8: Aldol Condensation
      Acetoacetyl CoA next undergoes an aldol-like addition of an acetyl CoA enolate ion in a reaction catalyzed by
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase. The reaction occurs by initial binding of the substrate to a cysteine
      -SH group in the enzyme, followed by enolate-ion addition and subsequent hydrolysis to give
      (3S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA).

      Step 3 of FIGURE 27.8: Reduction
      Reduction of HMG-CoA to give (R)-mevalonate is catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and
      requires 2 equivalents of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a close relative of
      NADH (Section 19.12). The reaction occurs in two steps and proceeds through an aldehyde intermediate. The
      first step is a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction involving hydride transfer from NADPH to the thioester
      carbonyl group of HMG-CoA. Following expulsion of HSCoA as leaving group, the aldehyde intermediate
      undergoes a second hydride addition to give mevalonate.

      Step 4 of FIGURE 27.8: Phosphorylation and Decarboxylation
      Three additional reactions are needed to convert mevalonate to isopentenyl diphosphate. The first two are
      straightforward phosphorylations by ATP that occur through nucleophilic substitution reactions on the
      terminal phosphorus. Mevalonate is first converted to mevalonate 5-phosphate (phosphomevalonate) by
      reaction with ATP; mevalonate 5-phosphate then reacts with a second ATP to give mevalonate 5-diphosphate
      (diphosphomevalonate). The third reaction results in phosphorylation of the tertiary hydroxyl group, followed
      by decarboxylation and loss of phosphate ion.

The final decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate seems unusual because decarboxylations of acids do
not typically occur except in -keto acids and malonic acids, in which the carboxylate group is two atoms
away from an additional carbonyl group. As discussed in Section 22.7, the function of this second carbonyl
group is to act as an electron acceptor and stabilize the charge resulting from loss of CO2. In fact, though, the
decarboxylation of a -keto acid and the decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate are closely related.

Catalyzed by mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase, the substrate is first phosphorylated on the free -OH
group by reaction with ATP to give a tertiary phosphate, which undergoes spontaneous SN1-like dissociation to
give a tertiary carbocation. The positive charge then acts as an electron acceptor to facilitate decarboxylation
in the same way a  carbonyl group does, giving isopentenyl diphosphate. (In the following structures, the
diphosphate group is abbreviated OPP.)

Conversion of Isopentenyl Diphosphate to Terpenoids

The conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to terpenoids begins with its isomerization to dimethylallyl
diphosphate, abbreviated DMAPP and formerly called dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These two C5 building
blocks then combine to give the C10 unit geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The corresponding alcohol, geraniol, is
itself a fragrant terpenoid that occurs in rose oil.
Further combination of GPP with another IPP gives the C15 unit farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and so on, up to C25.
1006  27 · Biomolecules: Lipids

      Terpenoids with more than 25 carbons--that is, triterpenoids (C30) and tetraterpenoids (C40)--are synthesized
      by dimerization of C15 and C20 units, respectively (FIGURE 27.9). Triterpenoids and steroids, in particular, arise
      from dimerization of farnesyl diphosphate to give squalene.

                                         FIGURE 27.9 An overview of terpenoid biosynthesis from isopentenyl diphosphate.

      The isomerization of isopentenyl diphosphate to dimethylallyl diphosphate is catalyzed by IPP isomerase and
      occurs through a carbocation pathway. Protonation of the IPP double bond by a hydrogen-bonded cysteine
      residue in the enzyme gives a tertiary carbocation intermediate, which is deprotonated by a glutamate residue
      as base to yield DMAPP. X-ray structural studies on the enzyme show that it holds the substrate in an unusually
      deep, well-protected pocket to shield the highly reactive carbocation from reaction with solvent or other
      external substances.

      Both the initial coupling of DMAPP with IPP to give geranyl diphosphate and the subsequent coupling of GPP
      with a second molecule of IPP to give farnesyl diphosphate are catalyzed by farnesyl diphosphate synthase.
      The process requires Mg2+ ion, and the key step is a nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the double
      bond of IPP behaves as a nucleophile in displacing diphosphate ion leaving group (PPi) or DMAPP. Evidence

FIGURE 27.10 Mechanism of the coupling reaction of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), to give
geranyl diphosphate (GPP).

Further conversion of geranyl diphosphate into monoterpenoids typically involves carbocation intermediates
and multistep reaction pathways that are catalyzed by terpene cyclases. Monoterpene cyclases function by
first isomerizing geranyl diphosphate to its allylic isomer linalyl diphosphate (LPP), a process that occurs
by spontaneous SN1-like dissociation to an allylic carbocation, followed by recombination. The effect of this
isomerization is to convert the C2-C3 double bond of GPP into a single bond, thereby making cyclization
possible and allowing E/Z isomerization of the double bond.

Further dissociation and cyclization by electrophilic addition of the cationic carbon to the terminal double bond
then gives a cyclic cation, which might either rearrange, undergo a hydride shift, be captured by a nucleophile,
or be deprotonated to give any of the several hundred known monoterpenoids. As just one example, limonene,
a monoterpenoid found in many citrus oils, arises by the biosynthetic pathway shown in FIGURE 27.11.

Two cyclohexane rings can be joined in either a cis or a trans manner. With cis fusion to give cis-decalin, both
groups at the ring-junction positions (the angular groups) are on the same side of the two rings. With trans
fusion to give trans-decalin, the groups at the ring junctions are on opposite sides.

As shown in FIGURE 27.12, steroids can have either a cis or a trans fusion of the A and B rings, but the other ring
fusions (B-C and C-D) are usually trans.

      Substituent groups on the steroid ring system can be either axial or equatorial. As with simple cyclohexanes,

and carried through the bloodstream to target tissues. There are two main classes of steroid hormones: the sex
hormones, which control maturation, tissue growth, and reproduction, and the adrenocortical hormones, which
regulate a variety of metabolic processes.

Sex Hormones

Testosterone and androsterone are the two most important male sex hormones, or androgens. Androgens are
responsible for the development of male secondary sex characteristics during puberty and for promoting tissue
and muscle growth. Both are synthesized in the testes from cholesterol. Androstenedione is another minor
hormone that has received particular attention because of its use by prominent athletes.

Estrone and estradiol are the two most important female sex hormones, or estrogens. Synthesized in the
ovaries from testosterone, estrogenic hormones are responsible for the development of female secondary sex
characteristics and for regulation of the menstrual cycle. Note that both have a benzene-like aromatic A ring. In
addition, another kind of sex hormone called a progestin is essential in preparing the uterus for implantation
of a fertilized ovum during pregnancy. Progesterone is the most important progestin.

Adrenocortical Hormones

Adrenocortical steroids are secreted by the adrenal glands, small organs located near the upper end of each

kidney. There are two types of adrenocortical steroids, called mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids.
Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, control tissue swelling by regulating cellular salt balance between Na+
and K+. Glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and in the

control of inflammation. Glucocorticoid ointments are widely used to bring down the swelling from exposure to

poison oak or poison ivy.
1012  27 · Biomolecules: Lipids

      Synthetic Steroids
      In addition to the hundreds of steroids isolated from plants and animals, many more have been synthesized
      in pharmaceutical laboratories in the search for new drugs. Among the best-known synthetic steroids are
      oral contraceptives and anabolic agents. Most birth control pills are a mixture of two compounds, a synthetic
      estrogen, such as ethynylestradiol, and a synthetic progestin, such as norethindrone. Anabolic steroids, such
      as methandrostenolone (Dianabol), are synthetic androgens that mimic the tissue-building effects of natural
      testosterone.

      27.7 Biosynthesis of Steroids

      Steroids are heavily modified triterpenoids that are biosynthesized in living organisms from farnesyl
      diphosphate (C15). A reductive dimerization first converts farnesyl diphosphate to the acyclic hydrocarbon
      squalene (C30), which is converted into lanosterol (FIGURE 27.13). Further rearrangements and degradations
      then take place to yield various steroids. The conversion of squalene to lanosterol is among the most intensively
      studied of biosynthetic transformations. Starting from an achiral, open-chain polyene, the entire process
      requires only two enzymes and results in the formation of six carbon-carbon bonds, four rings, and seven
      chirality centers.

                                             FIGURE 27.13 An overview of steroid biosynthesis from farnesyl diphosphate.

      Lanosterol biosynthesis begins with the selective epoxidation of squalene to give (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene,
      catalyzed by squalene epoxidase. Molecular O2 provides the epoxide oxygen atom, and NADPH is required,

along with a flavin coenzyme. The proposed mechanism involves reaction of FADH2 with O2 to produce a
flavin hydroperoxide intermediate (ROOH), which transfers an oxygen to squalene in a pathway initiated by
nucleophilic attack of the squalene double bond on the terminal hydroperoxide oxygen (FIGURE 27.14). The
flavin alcohol formed as a by-product loses H2O to give FAD, which is reduced back to FADH2 by NADPH. As
noted in Section 8.7, this biological epoxidation mechanism is closely analogous to the mechanism by which
peroxyacids (RCO3H) react with alkenes to give epoxides in the laboratory.

The second part of lanosterol biosynthesis is catalyzed by oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase and occurs as
shown in FIGURE 27.15. Squalene is folded by the enzyme into a conformation that aligns the various double
bonds for a cascade of successive intramolecular electrophilic additions, followed by a series of hydride and
methyl migrations. Except for the initial epoxide protonation/cyclization, the process is probably stepwise
and appears to involve discrete carbocation intermediates that are stabilized by electrostatic interactions with
electron-rich aromatic amino acids in the enzyme.

                               FIGURE 27.14 Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of squalene by flavin hydroperoxide.

Steps 1, 2 of FIGURE 27.15: Epoxide Opening and Initial Cyclizations
Cyclization begins in step 1 with protonation of the epoxide ring by an aspartic acid residue in the enzyme.
Nucleophilic opening of the protonated epoxide by the nearby 5,10 double bond (steroid numbering; Section
27.6) then yields a tertiary carbocation at C10. Further addition of C10 to the 8,9 double bond in step 2 next
gives a bicyclic tertiary cation at C8.

      Step 3 of FIGURE 27.15: Third Cyclization
      The third cationic cyclization is somewhat unusual because it occurs with non-Markovnikov regiochemistry
      and gives a secondary cation at C13 rather than the alternative tertiary cation at C14. There is growing evidence,
      however, that the tertiary carbocation may in fact be formed initially and that the secondary cation arises by
      subsequent rearrangement. The secondary cation is probably stabilized in the enzyme pocket by the proximity
      of an electron-rich aromatic ring.

Step 4 of FIGURE 27.15: Final Cyclization
The fourth and last cyclization occurs in step 4 by addition of the cationic center at C13 to the 17,20 double
bond, giving what is known as the protosteryl cation. The side-chain alkyl group at C17 has  (up)
stereochemistry, although this stereochemistry is lost in step 5 and then reset in step 6.

Steps 5-9 of FIGURE 27.15: Carbocation Rearrangements
Once the tetracyclic carbon skeleton of lanosterol has been formed, a series of carbocation rearrangements
occur (Section 7.11). The first rearrangement, hydride migration from C17 to C20, occurs in step 5 and results in
establishment of R stereochemistry at C20 in the side chain. In step 6, a second hydride migration occurs from
C13 to C17 on the  (bottom) face of the ring and reestablishes the 17 orientation of the side chain. Finally, two
methyl migrations, the first from C14 to C13 on the top () face and the second from C8 to C14 on the bottom
() face, place the positive charge at C8. A basic histidine residue in the enzyme then removes the neighboring
 proton from C9 to give lanosterol.

Saturated Fats, Cholesterol, and Heart Disease

We hear a lot these days about the relationship between saturated fats, cholesterol, and heart disease. What
are the facts? It's well established that a diet rich in saturated animal fats often leads to an increase in blood
serum cholesterol, particularly in sedentary, overweight individuals. Conversely, a diet lower in saturated fats
and higher in polyunsaturated fats leads to a lower serum cholesterol level. Studies have shown that a serum
cholesterol level greater than 240 mg/dL (a desirable value is < 200 mg/dL) is correlated with an increased
incidence of coronary artery disease, in which cholesterol deposits build up on the inner walls of coronary
arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart muscles.
A better indication of a person's risk of heart disease comes from a measurement of blood lipoprotein levels.
Lipoproteins are complex molecules with both lipid and protein components that transport lipids through the
body. They can be divided into three types according to density, as shown in TABLE 27.3. Very-low-density
lipoproteins (VLDLs) act primarily as carriers of triglycerides from the intestines to peripheral tissues, whereas
low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) act as carriers of cholesterol to and from
the liver.

FIGURE 27.17 It's hard to resist, but a high intake of saturated animal fat doesn't do much for your cholesterol level. (credit:
modification of work "food-chicken-meat-outdoors" by www.pixel.la/Flickr, Public Domain)

Evidence suggests that LDLs transport cholesterol as its fatty-acid ester to peripheral tissues, whereas HDLs
remove cholesterol as its stearate ester from dying cells. If LDLs deliver more cholesterol than is needed, and if
insufficient HDLs are present to remove it, the excess is deposited in arteries. Thus, a low level of low-density
lipoproteins is good because it means that less cholesterol is being transported, and a high level of high-density
lipoproteins is good because it means that more cholesterol is being removed. In addition, HDL contains an
enzyme that has antioxidant properties, offering further protection against heart disease.
As a rule of thumb, a person's risk drops about 25% for each increase of 5 mg/dL in HDL concentration. Normal
values are >40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women, perhaps explaining why premenopausal women
appear to be somewhat less susceptible than men to heart disease.

Not surprisingly, the most important factor in gaining high HDL levels is a generally healthful lifestyle. Obesity,
smoking, and lack of exercise lead to low HDL levels, whereas regular exercise and a sensible diet lead to
high HDL levels. Distance runners and other endurance athletes have HDL levels nearly 50% higher than the
general population. Failing that--some of us, but not everyone, wants to run 30 miles or bike 80 miles per
week--diet is also important. Diets high in cold-water fish, like salmon and whitefish, raise HDL and lower
blood cholesterol because these fish contain almost entirely polyunsaturated fat, including a large percentage
of omega-3 fatty acids. Animal fat from red meat and cooking fats should be minimized because saturated fats
and monounsaturated trans fats raise blood cholesterol.

Summary

Lipids are the naturally occurring materials isolated from plants and animals by extraction with a nonpolar
organic solvent. Animal fats and vegetable oils are the most widely occurring lipids. Both are
triacylglycerols--triesters of glycerol with long-chain fatty acids. Animal fats are usually saturated, whereas
vegetable oils usually have unsaturated fatty acid residues.

Phospholipids are important constituents of cell membranes and are of two kinds. Glycerophospholipids,
such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, are closely related to fats in that they have a
glycerol backbone esterified to two fatty acids (one saturated and one unsaturated) and to one phosphate ester.
Sphingomyelins have the amino alcohol sphingosine for their backbone.

Eicosanoids and terpenoids are still other classes of lipids. Eicosanoids, of which prostaglandins are the
most abundant kind, are derived biosynthetically from arachidonic acid, are found in all body tissues, and
have a wide range of physiological activity. Terpenoids are often isolated from the essential oils of plants,
have an immense diversity of structure, and are produced biosynthetically from the five-carbon precursor
isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Isopentenyl diphosphate is itself biosynthesized from 3 equivalents of acetate in
the mevalonate pathway.

Steroids are plant and animal lipids with a characteristic tetracyclic carbon skeleton. Like the eicosanoids,
steroids occur widely in body tissues and have a large variety of physiological activities. Steroids are closely
related to terpenoids and arise biosynthetically from the triterpenoid lanosterol. Lanosterol, in turn, arises from
cationic cyclization of the acyclic hydrocarbon squalene.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Nucleic acids are the last of the four major classes of biomolecules we'll consider. So
much has been written and spoken about DNA in the media that the basics of DNA replication and transcription
are probably known to you. Thus, we'll move fairly quickly through the fundamentals and then look more closely
at the chemical details of DNA sequencing, synthesis, and metabolism. This field is moving rapidly, and there's
a lot you may not be familiar with.
The nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), are the chemical carriers of
a cell's genetic information. Coded in a cell's DNA is the information that determines the nature of the cell,
controls its growth and division, and directs biosynthesis of the enzymes and other proteins required for
cellular functions.
1028  28 · Biomolecules: Nucleic Acids

      In addition to nucleic acids themselves, nucleic acid derivatives such as ATP are involved as phosphorylating
      agents in many biochemical pathways, and several important coenzymes, including NAD+, FAD, and coenzyme
      A, have nucleic acid components. See TABLE 26.3 for their structures.

      28.1 Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids

      Just as proteins are biopolymers made of amino acids, the nucleic acids are biopolymers made of nucleotides,
      joined together to form a long chain. Each nucleotide is composed of a nucleoside bonded to a phosphate group,
      and each nucleoside is composed of an aldopentose sugar linked through its anomeric carbon to the nitrogen
      atom of a heterocyclic purine or pyrimidine base.

      The sugar component in RNA is ribose, and the sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose. (In naming and numbering
      nucleotides, numbers with a prime superscript refer to positions on the sugar and numbers without a prime
      superscript refer to positions on the heterocyclic base. Thus, the prefix 2-deoxy indicates that oxygen is missing
      from C2 of ribose.) DNA contains four different amine bases: two substituted purines (A, adenine, and G,
      guanine) and two substituted pyrimidines (C, cytosine, and T, thymine). Adenine, guanine, and cytosine also
      occur in RNA, but thymine is replaced in RNA by a closely related pyrimidine base called U, uracil.

      The structures of the four deoxyribonucleotides and the four ribonucleotides are shown in FIGURE 28.2.
      Although similar chemically, DNA and RNA differ dramatically in size. Molecules of DNA are enormous,
      containing as many as 245 million nucleotides and having molecular weights as high as 75 billion. Molecules of
      RNA, by contrast, are much smaller, containing as few as 21 nucleotides and having molecular weights as low
      as 7000.

      28.2 Base Pairing in DNA

      Samples of DNA isolated from different tissues of the same species have the same proportions of heterocyclic
      bases, but samples from different species often have greatly differing proportions of bases. Human DNA, for
      example, contains about 30% each of adenine and thymine and about 20% each of guanine and cytosine. The
      bacterium Clostridium perfringens, however, contains about 37% each of adenine and thymine and only 13%
      each of guanine and cytosine. Note that in both examples the bases occur in pairs. Adenine and thymine are
      present in equal amounts, as are cytosine and guanine. Why?

      In 1953, Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, James Watson, and Francis Crick published scientific reports
      describing the secondary structure of DNA. According to their model, DNA under physiological conditions
      consists of two polynucleotide strands, running in opposite directions and coiled around each other in a double
      helix like the handrails on a spiral staircase. The two strands are complementary rather than identical and are
      held together by hydrogen bonds between specific pairs of bases, A with T and C with G. That is, whenever an
      A base occurs in one strand, a T base occurs opposite it in the other strand; when a C base occurs in one, a
      G occurs in the other (FIGURE 28.3). This complementary base-pairing thus explains why A and T are always
      found in equal amounts, as are G and C.

FIGURE 28.3 Hydrogen-bonding between base pairs in the DNA double helix. Electrostatic potential maps show that the faces of the
bases are relatively neutral, while the edges have positive and negative regions. Pairing G with C and A with T brings together oppositely
charged regions.

A full turn of a DNA double helix is shown in FIGURE 28.4. The helix is 20 Å wide, there are 10 base pairs per
turn, and each turn is 34 Å in length. Notice in FIGURE 28.4 that the two strands of the double helix coil in such a
way that two kinds of "grooves" result, a major groove 12 Å wide and a minor groove 6 Å wide. The major groove
is slightly deeper than the minor groove, and both are lined by flat heterocyclic bases. As a result, a variety of
other polycyclic aromatic molecules are able to slip sideways, or intercalate, between the stacked bases. Many
cancer-causing and cancer-preventing agents function by interacting with DNA in this way.

FIGURE 28.4 A turn of the DNA double helix in both space-filling and wire-frame formats. The sugar-phosphate backbone runs along
the outside of the helix, and the amine bases hydrogen bond to one another on the inside. Both major and minor grooves are visible.

An organism's genetic information is stored as a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides strung together in the DNA
chain. For the information to be preserved and passed on to future generations, a mechanism must exist for
1032  28 · Biomolecules: Nucleic Acids

      copying DNA. For the information to be used, a mechanism must exist for decoding the DNA message and
      implementing the instructions it contains.

      What Crick called the "central dogma of molecular genetics" says that the function of DNA is to store
      information and pass it on to RNA. The function of RNA, in turn, is to read, decode, and use the information
      received from DNA to make proteins. This view is greatly oversimplified but is nevertheless a good place to start.
      Three fundamental processes take place.

        · Replication is the process by which identical copies of DNA are made so that information can be preserved
            and handed down to offspring.

        · Transcription is the process by which genetic messages are read and carried out of the cell nucleus to
            ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs.

        · Translation is the process by which the genetic messages are decoded and used to synthesize proteins.

      28.3 Replication of DNA

      DNA replication is an enzyme-catalyzed process that begins with a partial unwinding of the double helix at
      various points along the chain, brought about by enzymes called helicases. Hydrogen bonds are broken, the two
      strands separate to form a "bubble," and bases are exposed. New nucleotides then line up on each strand in
      a complementary manner, A to T and G to C, and two new strands begin to grow from the ends of the bubble,
      called the replication forks. Each new strand is complementary to its old template strand, so two identical DNA
      double helices are produced (FIGURE 28.5). Because each of the new DNA molecules contains one old strand
      and one new strand, the process is described as semiconservative replication.

FIGURE 28.5 A representation of semiconservative DNA replication. The original double-stranded DNA partially unwinds, bases are
exposed, nucleotides line up on each strand in a complementary manner, and two new strands begin to grow. Both strands are synthesized
in the same 5  3 direction, one continuously and one in fragments.

Addition of nucleotides to the growing chain takes place in the 5  3 direction and is catalyzed by the DNA
polymerase enzyme. The key step is the addition of a nucleoside 5-triphosphate to the free 3-hydroxyl group
of the growing chain with the loss of a diphosphate leaving group.

Because both new DNA strands are synthesized in the 5  3 direction, they can't be made in exactly the same
way. One new strand must have its 3 end nearer a replication fork, while the other new strand has its 5 end
nearer the replication fork. What happens is that the complement of the original 5  3 strand is synthesized
continuously in a single piece to give a newly synthesized copy called the leading strand, while the complement
of the original 3  5 strand is synthesized discontinuously in small pieces called Okazaki fragments (named
for Tsuneko Okazaki, in recognition of her discovery of them) that are subsequently linked by DNA ligases to
form the lagging strand.
The magnitude of the replication process is staggering. The nucleus of every human cell contains 2 copies of
22 chromosomes plus an additional 2 sex chromosomes, for a total of 46. Each chromosome consists of one
very large DNA molecule, and the sum of the DNA in each of the two sets of chromosomes is estimated to be 3.0
billion base pairs, or 6.0 billion nucleotides. Despite the size of these enormous molecules, their base sequence
1034  28 · Biomolecules: Nucleic Acids

      is faithfully copied during replication. The entire copying process takes only a few hours and, after proofreading
      and repair, an error gets through only about once per 10 to 100 billion bases. In fact, only about 60 of these
      random mutations are passed on from parent to child per human generation.

      28.4 Transcription of DNA

      As noted previously, RNA is structurally similar to DNA but contains ribose rather than deoxyribose and uracil
      rather than thymine. RNA has three major types, each of which serves a specific purpose. In addition, there are
      a number of small RNAs that appear to control a wide variety of important cellular functions. All RNA molecules
      are much smaller than DNA, and all remain single-stranded rather than double-stranded.

        · Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic messages from DNA to ribosomes, small granular particles in the
            cytoplasm of a cell where protein synthesis takes place.

        · Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) complexed with protein provides the physical makeup of the ribosomes.
        · Transfer RNA (tRNA) transports amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are joined together to make

            proteins.
        · Small RNAs, also called functional RNAs, have a variety of functions within the cell, including silencing

            transcription and catalyzing chemical modifications of other RNA molecules.

      The genetic information in DNA is contained in segments called genes, each of which consists of a specific
      nucleotide sequence that encodes a specific protein. The conversion of that information from DNA into proteins
      begins in the nucleus of cells with the synthesis of mRNA by transcription of DNA. In bacteria, the process
      begins when RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to a promoter sequence on DNA, typically consisting
      of around 40 base pairs located upstream (5) of the transcription start site. Within the promoter are two
      hexameric consensus sequences, one located 10 base pairs upstream of the start and the second located 35
      base pairs upstream.

      Following formation of the polymerase-promoter complex, several turns of the DNA double helix untwist,
      forming a bubble and exposing 14 or so base pairs of the two strands. Appropriate ribonucleotides then line up
      by hydrogen-bonding to their complementary bases on DNA, bond formation occurs in the 5  3 direction, the
      RNA polymerase moves along the DNA chain, and the growing RNA molecule unwinds from DNA (FIGURE 28.6).
      At any one time, about 12 base pairs of the growing RNA remain hydrogen-bonded to the DNA template.

                                                  FIGURE 28.6 Biosynthesis of RNA using a DNA segment as a template.

      Unlike what happens in DNA replication, where both strands are copied, only one of the two DNA strands is
      transcribed into mRNA. The DNA strand that contains the gene is often called the sense strand, or coding
      strand, and the DNA strand that gets transcribed to give RNA is called the antisense strand, or noncoding
      strand. Because the sense strand and the antisense strand in DNA are complementary, and because the DNA
      antisense strand and the newly formed RNA strand are also complementary, the RNA molecule produced
      during transcription is a copy of the DNA sense strand. That is, the complement of the complement is the same
      as the original. The only difference is that the RNA molecule has a U everywhere that the DNA sense strand has
      a T.

      Another part of the picture in vertebrates and flowering plants is that genes are often not continuous segments
      of the DNA chain. Instead, a gene will begin in one small section of DNA called an exon, then be interrupted

by a noncoding section called an intron, and then take up again farther down the chain in another exon. The
final mRNA molecule results only after the noncoded sections are cut out of the transcribed mRNA and the
remaining pieces are joined together by spliceosome enzymes. The gene for triose phosphate isomerase in
maize, for instance, contains eight noncoding introns accounting for approximately 70% of the DNA base pairs
and nine coding exons accounting for only 30% of the base pairs.

28.5 Translation of RNA: Protein Biosynthesis

The primary cellular function of mRNA is to direct the biosynthesis of the thousands of diverse peptides and
proteins required by an organism--as many as 150,000 in a human. The mechanics of protein biosynthesis take
place on ribosomes, small granular particles in the cytoplasm of a cell that consist of about 60% ribosomal RNA
and 40% protein.

The specific ribonucleotide sequence in mRNA forms a message that determines the order in which amino
acid residues are to be joined. Each "word," or codon, along the mRNA chain consists of a sequence of three
ribonucleotides that is specific for a given amino acid. For example, the series UUC on mRNA is a codon
directing incorporation of the amino acid phenylalanine into the growing protein. Of the 43 = 64 possible triplets
of the four bases in RNA, 61 code for specific amino acids and 3 code for chain termination. TABLE 28.1 shows
the meaning of each codon.

      The message embedded in mRNA is read by transfer RNA (tRNA) in a process called translation. There are 61
      different tRNAs, one for each of the 61 codons that specify an amino acid. A typical tRNA is single-stranded and
      has roughly the shape of a cloverleaf, as shown in FIGURE 28.7. It consists of about 70 to 100 ribonucleotides
      and is bonded to a specific amino acid by an ester linkage through the 3 hydroxyl on ribose at the 3 end
      of the tRNA. Each tRNA also contains on its middle leaf a segment called an anticodon, a sequence of three
      ribonucleotides complementary to the codon sequence. For example, the codon sequence UUC present on
      mRNA is read by a phenylalanine-bearing tRNA having the complementary anticodon base sequence GAA.
      [Remember that nucleotide sequences are written in the 5  3 direction, so the sequence in an anticodon must
      be reversed. That is, the complement to (5)-UUC-(3) is (3)-AAG-(5), which is written as (5)-GAA-(3).]

nucleotides not specifically identified are chemically modified analogs of the four common nucleotides.

As each successive codon on mRNA is read, different tRNAs bring the correct amino acids into position for
enzyme-mediated transfer to the growing peptide. When synthesis of the proper protein is completed, a "stop"
codon signals the end, and the protein is released from the ribosome. This process is illustrated in FIGURE 28.8.

      A scientific revolution is now under way in molecular biology, as scientists learn how to manipulate and harness
      the genetic machinery of organisms. None of the extraordinary advances of the past several decades would have
      been possible, however, were it not for the discovery in 1977 of methods for sequencing immense DNA chains.

      The first step in DNA sequencing is to cleave the enormous chain at known points to produce smaller, more
      manageable pieces, a task accomplished by the use of restriction endonucleases, or restriction enzymes. Each
      different restriction enzyme, of which more than 4000 are known and approximately 600 are commercially
      available, cleaves a DNA molecule at a point in the chain where a specific base sequence occurs. For example,
      the restriction enzyme AluI cleaves between G and C in the four-base sequence AG-CT. Note that the sequence
      is a palindrome, meaning that the sequence (5)-AGCT-(3) is the same as its complement (3)-TCGA-(5) when
      both are read in the same 5  3 direction. The same is true for other restriction endonucleases.

      If the original DNA molecule is cut with another restriction enzyme having a different specificity for cleavage,
      still other segments are produced whose sequences partially overlap those produced by the first enzyme.
      Sequencing all the segments, followed by identification of the overlapping regions, allows for complete DNA
      sequencing.

      A dozen or so different methods of DNA sequencing are now available, and many others are under development.
      The Sanger dideoxy method is among the most frequently used and was the method responsible for first
      sequencing the entire human genome of 3.0 billion base pairs. In commercial sequencing instruments, the
      dideoxy method begins with a mixture of the following:

        · The restriction fragment to be sequenced
        · A small piece of DNA called a primer, whose sequence is complementary to that on the 3 end of the

            restriction fragment
        · The four 2-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs)
        · Very small amounts of the four 2,3-dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs), each of which is

           labeled with a fluorescent dye of a different color (A 2,3-dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate is one in
            which both 2 and 3 -OH groups are missing from ribose.)

      DNA polymerase is added to the mixture, and a strand of DNA complementary to the restriction fragment
      begins to grow from the end of the primer. Most of the time, only normal deoxyribonucleotides are incorporated
      into the growing chain because of their much higher concentration in the mixture, but every so often, a
      dideoxyribonucleotide is incorporated. When that happens, DNA synthesis stops because the chain end no
      longer has a 3-hydroxyl group for adding further nucleotides.

      When reaction is complete, the product consists of a mixture of DNA fragments of all possible lengths, each
      terminated by one of the four dye-labeled dideoxyribonucleotides. This product mixture is then separated
      according to the size of the pieces by gel electrophoresis (Section 26.2), and the identity of the terminal
      dideoxyribonucleotide in each piece--and thus the sequence of the restriction fragment--is determined by

noting the color with which the attached dye fluoresces. FIGURE 28.9 shows a typical result.

FIGURE 28.9 The sequence of a restriction fragment determined by the Sanger dideoxy method can be read simply by noting the colors
of the dye attached to each of the various terminal nucleotides.

So efficient is the automated dideoxy method that sequences up to 1100 nucleotides in length, with a
throughput of up to 19,000 bases per hour, can be sequenced with 98% accuracy. After a decade of work and a
cost of about $500 million, preliminary sequence information for the entire human genome of 3.0 billion base
pairs was announced early in 2001 and complete information was released in 2003. More recently, the genome
sequencing of individuals, including that of James Watson, one of the discoverers of the double helix, has been
accomplished. The sequencing price per genome is dropping rapidly and is currently less than $1,000, meaning
that the routine sequencing of individuals is within reach.

Remarkably, our genome appears to contain only about 21,000 genes, less than one-fourth the previously
predicted number and only about twice the number found in the common roundworm. It's also interesting
to note that the number of genes in a human (21,000) is much smaller than the number of kinds of proteins
(perhaps 500,000). This discrepancy arises because most proteins are modified in various ways after
translation (posttranslational modifications), so a single gene can ultimately give many different proteins.

28.7 DNA Synthesis

The ongoing revolution in molecular biology has brought with it an increased demand for the efficient chemical
synthesis of short DNA segments, called oligonucleotides, or simply oligos. The problems of DNA synthesis
are similar to those of peptide synthesis (Section 26.7) but are more difficult because of the complexity of
the nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide has multiple reactive sites that must be selectively protected and
deprotected at specific times, and coupling of the four nucleotides must be carried out in the proper sequence.
Automated DNA synthesizers are available, however, that allow the fast and reliable synthesis of DNA segments
up to 200 nucleotides in length.

DNA synthesizers operate on a principle similar to that of the Merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesizer
(Section 26.8). In essence, a protected nucleotide is covalently bonded to a solid support, and one nucleotide at
a time is added to the growing chain by the use of a coupling reagent. After the final nucleotide has been added,
all the protecting groups are removed and the synthetic DNA is cleaved from the solid support. Five steps are
needed:

STEP 1
The first step in DNA synthesis is to attach a protected deoxynucleoside to a silica (SiO2) support by an ester
linkage to the 3 -OH group of the deoxynucleoside. Both the 5 -OH group on the sugar and free -NH2 groups on
the heterocyclic bases must be protected. Adenine and cytosine bases are protected by benzoyl groups, guanine
is protected by an isobutyryl group, and thymine requires no protection. The deoxyribose 5 -OH is protected
as its p-dimethoxytrityl (DMT) ether.
1040  28 · Biomolecules: Nucleic Acids

      STEP 2
      The second step is removal of the DMT protecting group by treatment with dichloroacetic acid in CH2Cl2. The
      reaction occurs by an SN1 mechanism and proceeds rapidly because of the stability of the tertiary, benzylic
      dimethoxytrityl cation.

      STEP 3
      The third step is the coupling of the polymer-bonded deoxynucleoside with a protected deoxynucleoside
      containing a phosphoramidite group [R2NP(OR)2] at its 3 position. The coupling reaction takes place in the
      polar aprotic solvent acetonitrile, requires catalysis by the heterocyclic amine tetrazole, and yields a phosphite,
      P(OR)3, as product. Note that one of the phosphorus oxygen atoms is protected by a -cyanoethyl group,

                               . The coupling step takes place with better than 99% yield.

STEP 4
With the coupling accomplished, the phosphite product is oxidized to a phosphate by treatment with iodine in
aqueous tetrahydrofuran in the presence of 2,6-dimethylpyridine. The cycle of (1) deprotection, (2) coupling,
and (3) oxidation is then repeated until an oligonucleotide chain of the desired sequence has been constructed.

STEP 5
The final step is removal of all protecting groups and cleavage of the ester bond holding the DNA to the silica. All
these reactions are done at the same time by treatment with aqueous NH3. Purification by electrophoresis then
yields the synthetic DNA.

      28.8 The Polymerase Chain Reaction

      It often happens that only a tiny amount of DNA can be obtained directly, as might occur at a crime scene, so
      methods for obtaining larger amounts are sometimes needed to carry out sequencing and characterization. The
      invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by Kary Mullis in 1986 has been described as being to genes
      what Gutenberg's invention of the printing press was to the written word. Just as the printing press produces
      multiple copies of a book, PCR produces multiple copies of a given DNA sequence. Starting from less than 1
      picogram (pg) of DNA with a chain length of 10,000 nucleotides (1 pg = 10-12 g; about 105 molecules), PCR
      makes it possible to obtain several micrograms (1 g = 10-6 g; about 1011 molecules) in just a few hours.
      The key to the polymerase chain reaction is Taq DNA polymerase, a heat-stable enzyme isolated from the
      thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus found in a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. Taq polymerase
      is able to take a single strand of DNA having a short, primer segment of complementary chain at one end and
      then finish constructing the entire complementary strand. The overall process takes three steps, as shown in
      FIGURE 28.10. More recently, improved heat-stable DNA polymerases have become available, including Vent
      polymerase and Pfu polymerase, both isolated from bacteria growing near geothermal vents in the ocean floor.
      The error rate of both enzymes is substantially less than that of Taq.

                                       FIGURE 28.10 The polymerase chain reaction. Details are explained in the text.

STEP 1
The double-stranded DNA to be amplified is heated in the presence of Taq polymerase, Mg2+ ion, the four
deoxynucleotide triphosphate monomers (dNTPs), and a large excess of two short oligonucleotide primers of
about 20 bases each. Each primer is complementary to the sequence at the end of one of the target DNA
segments. At a temperature of 95 °C, double-stranded DNA denatures, spontaneously breaking apart into two
single strands.

STEP 2
The temperature is lowered to between 37 and 50 °C, allowing the primers, because of their relatively high
concentration, to anneal by hydrogen-bonding to their complementary sequence at the end of each target
strand.

STEP 3
The temperature is then raised to 72 °C, and Taq polymerase catalyzes the addition of further nucleotides to the
two primed DNA strands. When replication of each strand is complete, two copies of the original DNA now exist.
Repeating the denature-anneal-synthesize cycle a second time yields four DNA copies, repeating a third time
yields eight copies, and so on, in an exponential series.

PCR has been automated, and 30 or so cycles can be carried out in an hour, resulting in a theoretical
amplification factor of 230 (109). In practice, however, the efficiency of each cycle is less than 100%, and an
experimental amplification of about 106 to 108 is routinely achieved for 30 cycles.

DNA Fingerprinting

The invention of DNA sequencing has affected society in many ways, few more dramatic than those stemming
from the development of DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting arose from the discovery in 1984 that human
genes contain short, repeating sequences of noncoding DNA, called short tandem repeat (STR) loci.
Furthermore, the STR loci are slightly different for everyone except identical twins. By sequencing these loci, a
pattern unique to each person can be obtained.

Perhaps the most common and well-publicized use of DNA fingerprinting is that carried out by crime
laboratories to link suspects to biological evidence--blood, hair follicles, skin, or semen--found at a crime scene.
Many thousands of court cases have been decided based on DNA evidence.

For use in criminal cases, forensic laboratories in the United States have agreed on 13 core STR loci that are
most accurate for the identification of an individual. Based on these 13 loci, a Combined DNA Index System
(CODIS) has been established to serve as a registry of convicted offenders. When a DNA sample is obtained
from a crime scene, the sample is subjected to cleavage with restriction endonucleases to cut out fragments
containing the STR loci, the fragments are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, and the sequences of
the fragments are determined.

If the profile of sequences from a known individual and the profile from DNA obtained at a crime scene match,
the probability is approximately 82 billion to 1 that the DNA is from the same individual. In paternity cases,
where the DNA of male parent and offspring are related but not fully identical, the identity of the male parent
can be established with a probability of around 100,000 to 1. Even after several generations, paternity can still
be inferred from DNA analysis of the Y chromosome of direct male-line descendants. The most well-known such
case is that of Thomas Jefferson, one of the nation's founders, who likely impregnated enslaved person Sally
Hemings. Although Jefferson himself has no male-line descendants, DNA analysis of the male-line descendants
of Jefferson's paternal uncle contained the same Y chromosome as a male-line descendant of Eston Hemings,
the youngest son of Sally Hemings. Thus, a mixing of the two genomes is clear, although the male individual
responsible for that mixing can't be identified with 100% certainty.

Among its many other applications, DNA fingerprinting is widely used for the diagnosis of genetic disorders,
both prenatally and in newborns. Cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, Huntington's disease, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle
cell anemia, and thalassemia are among the many diseases that can be detected, enabling early treatment of an
affected child. Furthermore, by studying the DNA fingerprints of relatives with a history of a particular disorder,
it's possible to identify DNA patterns associated with the disease and perhaps obtain clues for an eventual cure.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense requires blood and saliva samples from all military personnel. The
samples are stored, and DNA is extracted if the need for identification of a casualty arises.

Summary

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are biological polymers that act as chemical carriers
of an organism's genetic information. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of nucleic acids yields nucleotides, the
monomer units from which RNA and DNA are constructed. Further enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the
nucleotides yields nucleosides plus phosphate. Nucleosides, in turn, consist of a purine or pyrimidine base
linked to the C1 of an aldopentose sugar--ribose in RNA and 2-deoxyribose in DNA. The nucleotides are joined
by phosphate links between the 5 phosphate of one nucleotide and the 3 hydroxyl on the sugar of another
nucleotide.

Molecules of DNA consist of two complementary polynucleotide strands held together by hydrogen bonds
between heterocyclic bases on the different strands and coiled into a double helix. Adenine and thymine form
hydrogen bonds to each other, as do cytosine and guanine.

Three processes take place in deciphering the genetic information of DNA:

· Replication of DNA is the process by which identical DNA copies are made. The DNA double helix unwinds,
   complementary deoxyribonucleotides line up in order, and two new DNA molecules are produced.

· Transcription is the process by which RNA is produced to carry genetic information from the nucleus to
   the ribosomes. A short segment of the DNA double helix unwinds, and complementary ribonucleotides line
   up to produce messenger RNA (mRNA).

· Translation is the process by which mRNA directs protein synthesis. Each mRNA is divided into codons,
   ribonucleotide triplets that are recognized by small amino acid-carrying molecules of transfer RNA
   (tRNA), which deliver the appropriate amino acids needed for protein synthesis.

Sequencing of DNA is carried out by the Sanger dideoxy method, and small DNA segments can be synthesized
in the laboratory by automated instruments. Small amounts of DNA can be amplified by factors of 106 using the

polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

must first understand life processes at the molecular level. This understanding, in turn, must be based on a
detailed knowledge of the chemical reactions and pathways used by living organisms. Just knowing what occurs
is not enough; it's also necessary to understand how and why organisms use the chemistry they do.
1052  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      Biochemical reactions are not mysterious. Even though the biological reactions that take place in living
      organisms often appear complicated, they follow the same rules of reactivity as laboratory reactions and they
      operate by the same mechanisms.

      Some of the molecules we'll be encountering are substantially larger and more complex than those we've been
      dealing with thus far. But don't be intimidated; keep your focus on the parts of the molecules where changes
      occur, and ignore the parts where nothing changes. The reactions themselves are exactly the same additions,
      eliminations, substitutions, carbonyl condensations, and so forth, that we've been dealing with all along. By the
      end of this chapter, it should be clear that the chemistry of living organisms is organic chemistry.

      29.1 An Overview of Metabolism and Biochemical Energy

      The many reactions that occur in the cells of living organisms are collectively called metabolism. The pathways
      that break down larger molecules into smaller ones are called catabolism, and the pathways that synthesize
      larger biomolecules from smaller ones are known as anabolism. Catabolic reaction pathways are usually

      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) plus hydrogen phosphate ion, HOPO32-.

      In the first catabolic stage, commonly called digestion, food is broken down in the mouth, stomach, and small

and amino acids. These smaller molecules are then absorbed and further degraded in the second stage of
catabolism to yield acetyl groups attached by a thioester bond to the large carrier molecule, coenzyme A. The
resultant compound, acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), is a key substance in the metabolism of food molecules
and in many other biological pathways. As noted in Section 21.8, the acetyl group in acetyl CoA is linked to the
sulfur atom of phosphopantetheine, which is itself linked to adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate.

Acetyl groups are oxidized inside cellular mitochondria in the third stage of catabolism, the citric acid cycle, to
yield CO2. (We'll see the details of the process in Section 29.7.) Like most oxidations, this stage releases a large
amount of energy, which is used in the fourth stage, the electron-transport chain, to accomplish the endergonic
phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with hydrogen phosphate ion (HOPO32-, abbreviated Pi) to
give adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

As the final result of food catabolism, ATP has been called the "energy currency" of the cell. Catabolic reactions
"buy" ATP with the energy they release to synthesize it from ADP and hydrogen phosphate ion. Anabolic
reactions then spend the ATP by transferring a phosphate group to another molecule, thereby regenerating ADP.
Energy production and use in living organisms thus revolves around the ATP ADP interconversion.

ADP and ATP are both phosphoric acid anhydrides, which contain  linkages analogous to the

                   linkage in carboxylic acid anhydrides. Just as carboxylic acid anhydrides react with alcohols by

breaking a C-O bond and forming a carboxylic ester, ROCOR' (Section 21.5), phosphoric acid anhydrides react
with alcohols by breaking a P-O bond and forming a phosphate ester, ROPO32-. The reaction is, in effect, a
nucleophilic acyl substitution at phosphorus. Note that phosphorylation reactions with ATP generally require
the presence of a divalent metal cation in the enzyme, usually Mg2+, to form a Lewis acid-base complex with the

phosphate oxygen atoms and to neutralize negative charge.
1054  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      How does the body use ATP? Recall from Section 6.7 that the free-energy change G must be negative and
      energy must be released for a reaction to be energetically favorable and occur spontaneously. If G is positive,
      the reaction is energetically unfavorable and the process can't occur spontaneously.
      For an energetically unfavorable reaction to occur, it must be "coupled" to an energetically favorable reaction so
      that the overall free-energy change for the two reactions together is favorable. To understand what it means for
      reactions to be coupled, imagine that reaction 1 does not occur to any reasonable extent because it has a small
      equilibrium constant and is energetically unfavorable; that is, the reaction has G > 0.

      where A and B are the biochemically "important" substances while m and n are enzyme cofactors, H2O, or other
      small molecules.
      Imagine also that product n can react with substance o to yield p and q in a second, highly favorable reaction
      that has a large equilibrium constant and G << 0.

      Taking the two reactions together, they share, or are coupled through, the common intermediate n, which is a
      product in the first reaction and a reactant in the second. When even a tiny amount of n is formed in reaction 1,
      it undergoes essentially complete conversion in reaction 2, thereby removing it from the first equilibrium and
      forcing reaction 1 to continually replenish n until reactant A is gone. That is, the two reactions added together
      have a favorable G < 0, and we say that the favorable reaction 2 "drives" the unfavorable reaction 1. Because
      the two reactions are coupled through n, the transformation of A to B becomes favorable.

      For an example of two reactions that are coupled, look at the phosphorylation reaction of glucose to yield
      glucose 6-phosphate plus water, an important step in the breakdown of dietary carbohydrates.

      The reaction of glucose with HOPO32- does not occur spontaneously because it is energetically unfavorable,
      with G°' = 13.8 kJ/mol. (The standard free-energy change for a biological reaction is denoted G°' and refers
      to a process in which reactants and products have a concentration of 1.0 M in a solution with pH = 7.) At the
      same time, however, the reaction of water with ATP to yield ADP plus HOPO32- is strongly favorable, with G°'

= -30.5 kJ/mol. When the two reactions are coupled, glucose reacts with ATP to yield glucose 6-phosphate plus
ADP in a reaction that is favorable by about 16.7 kJ/mol (4.0 kcal/mol). That is, ATP drives the phosphorylation
reaction of glucose.

It's this ability to drive otherwise unfavorable phosphorylation reactions that makes ATP so useful. The
resultant phosphates are much more reactive as leaving groups in nucleophilic substitutions and eliminations
than the alcohols they're derived from and are therefore more chemically useful.

PROBLEM One of the steps in fat metabolism is the reaction of glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol) with ATP to yield

29.2 Catabolism of Triacylglycerols: The Fate of Glycerol

The metabolic breakdown of triacylglycerols begins with their hydrolysis in the stomach and small intestine
to yield glycerol plus fatty acids. The reaction is catalyzed by a lipase, whose mechanism is shown in FIGURE
29.3. The active site of the enzyme contains a catalytic triad of aspartic acid, histidine, and serine residues,
which act cooperatively to provide the necessary acid and base catalysis for the individual steps. Hydrolysis
is accomplished by two sequential nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions, one that covalently binds an acyl
group to the side chain -OH of a serine residue on the enzyme and a second that frees the fatty acid from the
enzyme.

Steps 1-2 of FIGURE 29.3: Acyl Enzyme Formation
The first nucleophilic acyl substitution step--reaction of the triacylglycerol with the active-site serine to give
an acyl enzyme--begins with deprotonation of the serine alcohol by histidine to form the more strongly
nucleophilic alkoxide ion. This proton transfer is facilitated by a nearby side-chain carboxylate anion of aspartic
acid, which makes the histidine more basic and stabilizes the resultant histidine cation by electrostatic
interactions. The deprotonated serine adds to a carbonyl group of a triacylglycerol to give a tetrahedral
intermediate, which expels a diacylglycerol as a leaving group and produces an acyl enzyme. This step is
catalyzed by a proton transfer from histidine to make the leaving group a neutral alcohol.

Steps 3-4 of FIGURE 29.3: Hydrolysis
The second nucleophilic acyl substitution step hydrolyzes the acyl enzyme and gives the free fatty acid by
a mechanism analogous to that of the first two steps. Water is deprotonated by histidine to give hydroxide
ion, which adds to the enzyme-bound acyl group. The tetrahedral intermediate then expels the neutral serine
residue as the leaving group, freeing the fatty acid and returning the enzyme to its active form.

The fatty acids released on triacylglycerol hydrolysis are transported to mitochondria and degraded to acetyl
CoA, while the glycerol is carried to the liver for further metabolism. In the liver, glycerol is first phosphorylated
by reaction with ATP and then oxidized by NAD+. The resulting dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) enters the
carbohydrate glycolysis pathway, which we'll discuss in Section 29.5.
1058  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      You might note that C2 of glycerol is a prochiral center (Section 5.11) with two identical "arms." As is typical
      for enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the phosphorylation of glycerol is selective. Only the pro-R arm undergoes
      reaction, although this can't be predicted in advance.

      Note also that the phosphorylation product is named sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, where the sn- prefix means
      "stereospecific numbering." In this convention, the molecule is drawn as a Fischer projection with the - OH
      group at C2 pointing to the left and the glycerol carbon atoms numbered from the top.

      29.3 Catabolism of Triacylglycerols: -Oxidation

      The fatty acids that result from triacylglycerol hydrolysis are converted into thioesters with coenzyme A and
      then catabolized by a repetitive four-step sequence of reactions called the -oxidation pathway, shown in
      FIGURE 29.4. Each passage along the pathway results in the cleavage of an acetyl group from the end of the
      fatty-acid chain, until the entire molecule is ultimately degraded. As each acetyl group is produced, it enters the
      citric acid cycle and is further degraded to CO2, as we'll see in Section 29.7.

FIGURE 29.4 MECHANISM

The four steps of the -oxidation pathway, resulting in the cleavage of an acetyl
group from the end of the fatty-acid chain. The key chain-shortening step is a
retro-Claisen reaction of a -keto thioester. Individual steps are explained in the
text.

Step 1 of FIGURE 29.4: Introduction of a Double Bond
The -oxidation pathway begins when two hydrogen atoms are removed from C2 and C3 of the fatty acyl CoA
by one of a family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to yield an ,-unsaturated acyl CoA. This kind of oxidation--the

introduction of a conjugated double bond into a carbonyl compound--occurs frequently in biochemical

pathways and usually involves the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Reduced FADH2 is the by-
product.
1060  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      The mechanisms of FAD-catalyzed reactions are often difficult to establish because flavin coenzymes can follow
      both two-electron (polar) and one-electron (radical) pathways. As a result, extensive studies of the family of
      acyl-CoA dehydrogenases have not yet provided a clear picture of how these enzymes function. What is known
      is that: (1) The first step is abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen from the acidic  position of the acyl CoA to give
      a thioester enolate ion. Hydrogen-bonding between the acyl carbonyl group and the ribitol hydroxyls of FAD
      increases the acidity of the acyl group. (2) The pro-R hydrogen at the  position is transferred to FAD. (3) The
      ,-unsaturated acyl CoA that results has a trans double bond.

      One suggested mechanism has the reaction taking place by a conjugate nucleophilic addition of hydride,
      analogous to what occurs during alcohol oxidations with NAD+. Electrons on the enolate ion might expel a 
      hydride ion, which could add to the doubly bonded N5 nitrogen on FAD. Protonation of the intermediate at N1
      would give the product.

Step 2 of FIGURE 29.4: Conjugate Addition of Water
The ,-unsaturated acyl CoA produced in step 1 reacts with water by a conjugate addition pathway (Section
19.13) to yield a -hydroxyacyl CoA in a process catalyzed by enoyl CoA hydratase. Water as nucleophile adds
to the  carbon of the double bond, yielding an intermediate thioester enolate ion that is protonated on the 
position.

Step 3 of FIGURE 29.4: Alcohol Oxidation
The -hydroxyacyl CoA from step 2 is oxidized to a -ketoacyl CoA in a reaction catalyzed by one of a family

of L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases, which differ in substrate specificity according to the chain length of

the acyl group. As in the oxidation of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate mentioned at the
end of Section 29.2, this alcohol oxidation requires NAD+ as a coenzyme and yields reduced NADH/H+ as by-

product. Deprotonation of the hydroxyl group is carried out by a histidine residue at the active site.

Step 4 of FIGURE 29.4: Chain Cleavage
Acetyl CoA is split off from the chain in the final step of -oxidation, leaving an acyl CoA that is two carbon
atoms shorter than the original. The reaction is catalyzed by -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and is mechanistically the
reverse of a Claisen condensation reaction (Section 23.7). In the forward direction, a Claisen condensation joins
two esters together to form a -keto ester product. In the reverse direction, a retro-Claisen reaction splits apart
a -keto ester (or -keto thioester in this case) to form two esters (or two thioesters).

The retro-Claisen reaction occurs by nucleophilic addition of a cysteine -SH group on the enzyme to the keto
group of the -ketoacyl CoA to yield an alkoxide ion intermediate. Cleavage of the C2-C3 bond then follows, with
the expulsion of an acetyl CoA enolate ion that is immediately protonated. The enzyme-bound acyl group then
undergoes nucleophilic acyl substitution by reaction with a molecule of coenzyme A, and the chain-shortened
acyl CoA that results re-enters the -oxidation pathway for further degradation.

      Look at the catabolism of myristic acid shown in FIGURE 29.5 to see the overall results of the -oxidation
      pathway. The first passage converts the 14-carbon myristoyl CoA into the 12-carbon lauroyl CoA plus acetyl
      CoA, the second passage converts lauroyl CoA into the 10-carbon caproyl CoA plus acetyl CoA, the third passage
      converts caproyl CoA into the 8-carbon capryloyl CoA, and so on. Note that the final passage produces two
      molecules of acetyl CoA because the precursor has four carbons.

      FIGURE 29.5 Catabolism of the 14-carbon myristic acid by the -oxidation pathway yields seven molecules of acetyl CoA after six
      passages.

      Most fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, so none are left over after -oxidation. Those fatty
      acids with an odd number of carbon atoms yield the three-carbon propionyl CoA in the final -oxidation.
      Propionyl CoA is then converted to succinate by a multistep radical pathway, and succinate enters the citric acid
      cycle (Section 29.7). Note that the three-carbon propionyl group should technically be called propanoyl, but
      biochemists generally use the nonsystematic name.

29.4 Biosynthesis of Fatty Acids

One of the most striking features of the common fatty acids is that they have an even number of carbon atoms
(TABLE 27.1). This occurs because all fatty acids are derived biosynthetically from acetyl CoA by sequential
addition of two-carbon units to a growing chain. The acetyl CoA, in turn, arises primarily from the metabolic
breakdown of carbohydrates in the glycolysis pathway, which we'll see in Section 29.5. Thus, dietary
carbohydrates consumed in excess of immediate energy needs are turned into fats for storage.

As a general rule in biological chemistry, the anabolic pathway by which a substance is made is not the reverse
of the catabolic pathway by which the same substance is degraded. The two paths must differ in some respects
for both to be energetically favorable. Thus, the -oxidation pathway for converting fatty acids into acetyl CoA
and the biosynthesis of fatty acids from acetyl CoA are related but are not exact opposites. Differences include
the identity of the acyl-group carrier, the stereochemistry of the -hydroxyacyl reaction intermediate, and the
identity of the redox coenzyme. FAD is used to introduce a double bond in -oxidation, while NADPH is used to
reduce the double bond in fatty-acid biosynthesis.

In bacteria, each step in fatty-acid synthesis is catalyzed by a separate enzyme. In vertebrates, however, fatty-
acid synthesis is catalyzed by an immense, multienzyme complex called a synthase that contains two identical
subunits of 2505 amino acids each and catalyzes all steps in the pathway. In fact, for an 18-carbon fatty acid,
the synthase catalyzes 42 separate steps! An overview of fatty-acid biosynthesis is shown in FIGURE 29.6.

Steps 1-2 of FIGURE 29.6: Acyl Transfers
The starting material for fatty-acid biosynthesis is the thioester acetyl CoA, the final product of carbohydrate
breakdown, as we'll see in Section 29.6. The pathway begins with several priming reactions, which transport
acetyl CoA and convert it into more reactive species. The first priming reaction is a nucleophilic acyl
substitution reaction that converts acetyl CoA into acetyl ACP (acyl carrier protein).

Notice that the mechanism of the nucleophilic acyl substitution in step 1 can be given in an abbreviated form
that saves space by not explicitly showing the tetrahedral reaction intermediate. Instead, electron movement
is shown as a heart-shaped path around the carbonyl oxygen to imply the two steps of the full mechanism.
Biochemists commonly use this kind of abbreviated format, and we'll also use it on occasion through the rest of
this chapter.

In bacteria, ACP is a small protein of 77 residues that transports an acyl group from one enzyme to another.
In vertebrates, however, ACP appears to be a long arm on a multienzyme synthase complex, whose apparent
function is to shepherd an acyl group from site to site within the complex. As in acetyl CoA, the acyl group in
acetyl ACP is linked by a thioester bond to the sulfur atom of phosphopantetheine. The phosphopantetheine is
in turn linked to ACP through the side-chain -OH group of a serine residue in the enzyme.

Step 2, another priming reaction, involves a further exchange of thioester linkages by another nucleophilic acyl
substitution and results in covalent bonding of the acetyl group to a cysteine residue in the synthase complex
that catalyzes the upcoming condensation step.
Steps 3-4 of FIGURE 29.6: Carboxylation and Acyl Transfer
Step 3 is a loading reaction in which acetyl CoA is carboxylated by reaction with HCO3- and ATP to yield malonyl
CoA plus ADP. This step requires the coenzyme biotin, which is bonded to the lysine residue of acetyl CoA
carboxylase and acts as a carrier of CO2. Biotin first reacts with bicarbonate ion to give N-carboxybiotin, which
then reacts with the enolate ion of acetyl CoA and transfers the CO2 group. Thus, biotin acts as a carrier of CO2,
binding it in one step and releasing it in another.
The mechanism of the CO2 transfer reaction with acetyl CoA to give malonyl CoA is thought to involve CO2 as
the reactive species. One proposal is that the loss of CO2 is favored by hydrogen-bond formation between the
N-carboxybiotin carbonyl group and a nearby acidic site in the enzyme. Simultaneous deprotonation of acetyl
CoA by a basic site in the enzyme gives a thioester enolate ion that can react with CO2 as it forms (FIGURE 29.7).

      Following the formation of malonyl CoA, another nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction occurs in step 4 to
      form the more reactive malonyl ACP, thereby binding the malonyl group to an ACP arm of the multienzyme
      synthase. At this point, both acetyl and malonyl groups are bound to the enzyme, and the stage is set for their
      condensation.
      Step 5 of FIGURE 29.6: Condensation
      The key carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction that builds the fatty-acid chain occurs in step 5. This step is
      simply a Claisen condensation between acetyl synthase as the electrophilic acceptor and malonyl ACP as the
      nucleophilic donor. The mechanism of the condensation is thought to involve decarboxylation of malonyl ACP
      to give an enolate ion, followed by immediate nucleophilic addition of the enolate ion to the carbonyl group of
      acetyl synthase. Breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate then gives the four-carbon condensation product
      acetoacetyl ACP and frees the synthase binding site for attachment of the chain-elongated acyl group at the end
      of the sequence.

Steps 6-8 of FIGURE 29.6: Reduction and Dehydration
The ketone carbonyl group in acetoacetyl ACP is next reduced to the alcohol -hydroxybutyryl ACP by -keto
thioester reductase and NADPH, a reducing coenzyme closely related to NADH. R stereochemistry results at the
newly formed chirality center in the -hydroxy thioester product. (Note that the systematic name of a butyryl
group is butanoyl.)

Subsequent dehydration of -hydroxybutyryl ACP by an E1cB reaction in step 7 yields trans-crotonyl ACP, and
the carbon-carbon double bond of crotonyl ACP is reduced by NADPH in step 8 to yield butyryl ACP. The double-
bond reduction occurs by conjugate nucleophilic addition of a hydride ion from NADPH to the  carbon of
trans-crotonyl ACP. In vertebrates, this reduction occurs by an overall syn addition, but other organisms carry
out similar chemistry with different stereochemistry.

The net effect of the eight steps in the fatty-acid biosynthesis pathway is to take two 2-carbon acetyl groups and
combine them into a 4-carbon butyryl group. Further condensation of the butyryl group with another malonyl
ACP yields a 6-carbon unit, and still further repetitions add two carbon atoms at a time until the 16-carbon
palmitoyl ACP is produced.

1, with Mg2+ ion again required as cofactor. Interestingly, the product of step 2 is the  anomer of fructose
6-phosphate, but it is the  anomer that is phosphorylated in step 3, implying that the two anomers equilibrate
rapidly through the open-chain form. The result is a molecule ready to be split into the two three-carbon
intermediates that will ultimately become two molecules of pyruvate.

Step 4 of FIGURE 29.8: Cleavage

Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved in step 4 into two 3-carbon pieces, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)

and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). The bond between C3 and C4 of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate breaks, and

a  group is formed at C4. Mechanistically, the cleavage is the reverse of an aldol reaction (Section 23.1)

and is catalyzed by an aldolase. A forward aldol reaction joins two aldehydes or ketones to give a -hydroxy

carbonyl compound, while a retro-aldol reaction, as in this case, cleaves a -hydroxy carbonyl compound into

two aldehydes or ketones.
1072  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      Two classes of aldolases are used by organisms for catalysis of the retro-aldol reaction. In fungi, algae, and
      some bacteria, the retro-aldol reaction is catalyzed by class II aldolases, which function by coordination of the
      fructose carbonyl group with Zn2+ as Lewis acid. In plants and animals, the reaction is catalyzed by class I
      aldolases and does not take place on the free ketone. Instead, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate undergoes reaction
      with the side-chain -NH2 group of a lysine residue on the aldolase to yield a protonated enzyme-bound imine
      (Section 19.8), which is often called a Schiff base in biochemistry.

      Because of its positive charge, the iminium ion is a better electron acceptor than a ketone carbonyl group. Retro-
      aldol reaction ensues, giving glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and an enamine, which is protonated to give another
      iminium ion that is hydrolyzed to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate (FIGURE 29.11).

      FIGURE 29.11 Mechanism of step 4 in FIGURE 29.8, the cleavage of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to yield glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
      and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The reaction occurs through an iminium ion formed by reaction with a lysine residue in the enzyme.

      Step 5 of FIGURE 29.8: Isomerization
      Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is isomerized in step 5 by triose phosphate isomerase to form a second equivalent
      of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. As in the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in step 2,
      the isomerization takes place by keto-enol tautomerization through a common enediol intermediate. A base
      deprotonates C1 and then reprotonates C2 using the same hydrogen. The net result of steps 4 and 5 together is
      the production of two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules, both of which pass down the rest of the pathway.
      Thus, each of the remaining five steps of glycolysis takes place twice for every glucose molecule entering at step
      1.

Steps 6-7 of FIGURE 29.9: Oxidation, Phosphorylation, and Dephosphorylation

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized and phosphorylated in step 6 to give 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (FIGURE
29.12). The reaction is catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and begins by nucleophilic
addition of the -SH group of a cysteine residue in the enzyme to the aldehyde carbonyl group to yield a
hemithioacetal (Section 19.10), the sulfur analog of a hemiacetal. Oxidation of the hemithioacetal -OH group
by NAD+ then yields a thioester, which reacts with phosphate ion in a nucleophilic acyl substitution step to yield
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a mixed anhydride derived from a carboxylic acid and a phosphoric acid.

FIGURE 29.12 Mechanism of step 6 in FIGURE 29.9, the oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to give
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The process occurs through initial formation of a hemiacetal that is oxidized to a thioester and converted into an
acyl phosphate.

Like all anhydrides (Section 21.5), the mixed carboxylic-phosphoric anhydride is a reactive substrate in
nucleophilic acyl (or phosphoryl) substitution reactions. Reaction of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate with ADP occurs
in step 7 by substitution on phosphorus, resulting in transfer of a phosphate group to ADP and giving ATP
plus 3-phosphoglycerate. The process is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase and requires Mg2+ as cofactor.
Together, steps 6 and 7 accomplish the oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid.

Step 8 of FIGURE 29.9: Isomerization
3-Phosphoglycerate isomerizes to 2-phosphoglycerate in a step catalyzed by phosphoglycerate mutase. In
1074  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      plants, 3-phosphoglycerate transfers its phosphoryl group from its C3 oxygen to a histidine residue on the
      enzyme in one step and then accepts the same phosphoryl group back onto the C2 oxygen in a second step. In
      animals and yeast, however, the enzyme contains a phosphorylated histidine, which transfers its phosphoryl
      group to the C2 oxygen of 3-phosphoglycerate and forms 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate as intermediate. The same
      histidine then accepts a phosphoryl group from the C3 oxygen to yield the isomerized product plus the
      regenerated enzyme. As explained in Section 29.4, we'll occasionally use an abbreviated mechanism for
      nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions to save space.

      Steps 9-10 of FIGURE 29.9: Dehydration and Dephosphorylation
      Like most -hydroxy carbonyl compounds, 2-phosphoglycerate undergoes a ready dehydration in step 9 by an
      E1cB mechanism (Section 23.3). The process is catalyzed by enolase, and the product is phosphoenolpyruvate,
      abbreviated PEP. Two Mg2+ ions are associated with the 2-phosphoglycerate to neutralize the negative charges.

      Transfer of the phosphoryl group to ADP in step 10 then generates ATP and gives enolpyruvate, which
      tautomerizes to pyruvate. The reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase and requires that a molecule of fructose
      1,6-bisphosphate also be present, as well as 2 equivalents of Mg2+. One Mg2+ ion coordinates to ADP, and the
      other increases the acidity of a water molecule necessary for protonation of the enolate ion.

29.6 Conversion of Pyruvate to Acetyl CoA

Pyruvate, produced by catabolism of glucose (and by degradation of several amino acids), can undergo several
further transformations depending on the conditions and on the organism. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate
can either be reduced by NADH to yield lactate [CH3CH(OH)CO2-] or, in yeast, fermented to give ethanol.
Under typical aerobic conditions in mammals, however, pyruvate is converted by a process called oxidative
decarboxylation to give acetyl CoA plus CO2. (Oxidative because the oxidation state of the carbonyl carbon rises
from that of a ketone to that of a thioester.)

The conversion occurs through a multistep sequence of reactions catalyzed by a complex of enzymes and
cofactors called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The process occurs in three stages, each catalyzed by
one of the enzymes in the complex, as outlined in FIGURE 29.13. Acetyl CoA, the ultimate product, then acts as
fuel for the final stage of catabolism, the citric acid cycle.

Step 1 of FIGURE 29.13: Addition of Thiamin Diphosphate
The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA begins by reaction of pyruvate with thiamin diphosphate, a derivative
of vitamin B1. Formerly called thiamin pyrophosphate, thiamin diphosphate is usually abbreviated as TPP. The
spelling thiamine is also correct and frequently used.

The key structural element in thiamin diphosphate is the thiazolium ring--a five-membered, unsaturated
heterocycle containing a sulfur atom and a positively charged nitrogen atom. The thiazolium ring is weakly
acidic, with a pKa of approximately 18 for the ring hydrogen between N and S. Bases can therefore deprotonate
thiamin diphosphate, leading to formation of an ylide much like the phosphonium ylides used in Wittig
reactions (Section 19.11). As in the Wittig reaction, the TPP ylide is a nucleophile and adds to the ketone
carbonyl group of pyruvate to yield an alcohol addition product.

1078  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      Step 2 of FIGURE 29.13: Decarboxylation

      The TPP addition product, which contains an iminium ion  to a carboxylate anion, undergoes decarboxylation

      in much the same way that a -keto acid decarboxylates in the acetoacetic ester synthesis (Section 22.7). The

      bond of the pyruvate addition product acts like the      bond of a -keto acid to accept electrons as CO2

      leaves, giving hydroxyethylthiamin diphosphate (HETPP).

      Step 3 of FIGURE 29.13: Reaction with Lipoamide

      Hydroxyethylthiamin diphosphate is an enamine (                    ), which, like all enamines, is nucleophilic

      (Section 23.11). It therefore reacts with the enzyme-bound disulfide lipoamide by nucleophilic attack on a

      sulfur atom, displacing the second sulfur in an SN2-like process.

      Step 4 of FIGURE 29.13: Elimination of Thiamin Diphosphate
      The product of the HETPP reaction with lipoamide is a hemithioacetal, which eliminates thiamin diphosphate
      ylide. This elimination is the reverse of the ketone addition in step 1 and generates acetyl dihydrolipoamide.

      Step 5 of FIGURE 29.13: Acyl Transfer
      Acetyl dihydrolipoamide, a thioester, undergoes a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction with coenzyme A
      to yield acetyl CoA plus dihydrolipoamide. The dihydrolipoamide is then oxidized back to lipoamide by FAD
      (Section 29.3), and the FADH2 that results is in turn oxidized back to FAD by NAD+, completing the catalytic
      cycle.

29.7 The Citric Acid Cycle

The initial stages of catabolism result in the conversion of both fats and carbohydrates into acetyl groups that
are bonded through a thioester link to coenzyme A. Acetyl CoA then enters the next stage of catabolism--the
citric acid cycle, also called the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or Krebs cycle, after Hans Krebs, who unraveled
its complexities in 1937. The overall result of the cycle is the conversion of an acetyl group into two molecules
of CO2 plus reduced coenzymes by the eight-step reaction sequence shown in FIGURE 29.14.

As its name implies, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop of reactions in which the product of the final step
(oxaloacetate) is a reactant in the first step. The intermediates are constantly regenerated, flowing continuously
through the cycle, which operates as long as the oxidizing coenzymes NAD+ and FAD are available. To meet
this condition, the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH2 must be reoxidized via the electron-transport chain,
which in turn relies on oxygen as the ultimate electron acceptor. Thus, the cycle is dependent on the availability
of oxygen and on the operation of the electron-transport chain.
1080  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      FIGURE 29.14 MECHANISM

      The citric acid cycle is an eight-step series of reactions that results in the conversion of an acetyl group
      into two molecules of CO2 plus reduced coenzymes. Individual steps are explained in the text.

      Step 1 of FIGURE 29.14: Addition to Oxaloacetate
      Acetyl CoA enters the citric acid cycle in step 1 by nucleophilic addition to the oxaloacetate carbonyl group, to
      give (S)-citryl CoA. This addition is an aldol reaction and is catalyzed by citrate synthase, as discussed in Section
      26.11. (S)-Citryl CoA is then hydrolyzed to citrate by a typical nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction with water,
      catalyzed by the same citrate synthase enzyme.
      Note that the hydroxyl-bearing carbon of citrate is a prochirality center and contains two identical arms.

ketone carbonyl group, the pro-S arm of citrate is derived from acetyl CoA and the pro-R arm is derived from
oxaloacetate.

Step 2 of FIGURE 29.14: Isomerization
Citrate, a prochiral tertiary alcohol, is next converted into its isomer, (2R,3S)-isocitrate, a chiral secondary
alcohol. The isomerization occurs in two steps, both of which are catalyzed by the same aconitase enzyme. The
initial step is an E1cB dehydration of a -hydroxy acid to give cis-aconitate, the same sort of reaction that occurs
in step 9 of glycolysis (FIGURE 29.8). The second step is a conjugate nucleophilic addition of water to the CC
bond (Section 19.13). The dehydration of citrate takes place specifically on the pro-R arm--the one derived from
oxaloacetate--rather than on the pro-S arm derived from acetyl CoA.

Step 3 of FIGURE 29.14: Oxidation and Decarboxylation
(2R,3S)-Isocitrate, a secondary alcohol, is oxidized by NAD+ in step 3 to give the ketone oxalosuccinate, which
loses CO2 to give -ketoglutarate. Catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase, the decarboxylation is a typical
reaction of a -keto acid, just like that in the acetoacetic ester synthesis (Section 22.7). The enzyme requires a
divalent cation as a cofactor to polarize the ketone carbonyl group and make it a better electron acceptor.
1082  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      Step 4 of FIGURE 29.14: Oxidative Decarboxylation
      The transformation of -ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA in step 4 is a multistep process just like the
      transformation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA that we saw in FIGURE 29.13. In both cases, an -keto acid loses CO2
      and is oxidized to a thioester in a series of steps catalyzed by a multienzyme dehydrogenase complex. As in the
      conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the reaction involves an initial nucleophilic addition reaction of thiamin
      diphosphate ylide to -ketoglutarate, followed by decarboxylation. Reaction with lipoamide, elimination of TPP
      ylide, and finally a transesterification of the dihydrolipoamide thioester with coenzyme A yields succinyl CoA.

      Step 5 of FIGURE 29.14: Acyl CoA Cleavage
      Succinyl CoA is converted to succinate in step 5. This reaction is catalyzed by succinyl CoA synthetase and
      is coupled with phosphorylation of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to give guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The
      overall transformation is similar to that of steps 6 through 8 in glycolysis (FIGURE 29.8), in which a thioester
      is converted into an acyl phosphate and a phosphate group is then transferred to ADP. The overall result is a
      "hydrolysis" of the thioester group without involvement of water.

      Step 6 of FIGURE 29.14: Dehydrogenation
      Succinate is dehydrogenated in step 6 by the FAD-dependent succinate dehydrogenase to give fumarate. This
      process is analogous to what occurs during the -oxidation pathway of fatty-acid catabolism (Section 29.3).
      The reaction is stereospecific, removing the pro-S hydrogen from one carbon and the pro-R hydrogen from the
      other.

      Steps 7-8 of FIGURE 29.14: Hydration and Oxidation
      The final two steps in the citric acid cycle are the conjugate nucleophilic addition of water to fumarate to yield
      (S)-malate and the oxidation of (S)-malate by NAD+ to give oxaloacetate. The addition is catalyzed by fumarase
      and is mechanistically similar to the addition of water to cis-aconitate in step 2. This reaction occurs through
      an enolate-ion intermediate, which is protonated on the side opposite the OH, leading to a net anti addition.

29.8 Carbohydrate Biosynthesis: Gluconeogenesis

Glucose is the body's primary fuel when food is plentiful, but in times of fasting or prolonged exercise, glucose
stores can become depleted. Most tissues then begin metabolizing fats as their source of acetyl CoA, but
the brain is different. The brain relies almost entirely on glucose for fuel and is dependent on receiving a
continuous supply in the blood. When the supply of glucose fails, even for a brief time, irreversible damage can
occur. Thus, a pathway for synthesizing glucose from simple precursors is crucial.
Higher organisms are not able to synthesize glucose from acetyl CoA but must instead use one of the three-
carbon precursors lactate, glycerol, or alanine, all of which are readily converted into pyruvate.
1084  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      Pyruvate then becomes the starting point for gluconeogenesis, the 11-step biosynthetic pathway by which
      organisms make glucose (FIGURE 29.15). The gluconeogenesis pathway is not the reverse of the glycolysis
      pathway by which glucose is degraded. As with the catabolic and anabolic pathways for fatty acids (Section 29.3

Step 2 of FIGURE 29.15: Decarboxylation and Phosphorylation
Decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, a -keto acid, occurs by the typical retro-aldol mechanism like that in step 3 in
the citric acid cycle (FIGURE 29.14), and phosphorylation of the resultant pyruvate enolate ion by GTP occurs
concurrently to give phosphoenolpyruvate. This reaction is catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

Steps 3-4 of FIGURE 29.15: Hydration and Isomerization
Conjugate nucleophilic addition of water to the double bond of phosphoenolpyruvate gives 2-phosphoglycerate
by a process similar to that of step 7 in the citric acid cycle. Phosphorylation of C3 and dephosphorylation of
C2 then yields 3-phosphoglycerate. Mechanistically, these steps are the reverse of steps 9 and 8 in glycolysis
(FIGURE 29.8), which have equilibrium constants near 1 so that substantial amounts of reactant and product
are both present.

Steps 5-7 of FIGURE 29.15: Phosphorylation, Reduction, and Tautomerization
Reaction of 3-phosphoglycerate with ATP generates the corresponding acyl phosphate,
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which binds to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by a thioester bond to
a cysteine residue. Reduction of the thioester by NADH/H+ yields the corresponding aldehyde, and keto-enol
tautomerization of the aldehyde gives dihydroxyacetone phosphate. All three steps comprise a mechanistic
reversal of the corresponding steps 7, 6, and 5 of glycolysis and have equilibrium constants near 1.
1088  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      Step 8 of FIGURE 29.16: Aldol Reaction
      Dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, the two 3-carbon units produced in step 7, join
      by an aldol reaction to give fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the reverse of step 4 in glycolysis (FIGURE 29.11). As in
      glycolysis, the reaction is catalyzed in plants and animals by a class I aldolase and takes place on an iminium
      ion formed by reaction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate with a side-chain lysine -NH2 group on the enzyme.
      Loss of a proton from the neighboring carbon then generates an enamine, an aldol-like reaction ensues, and the
      product is hydrolyzed.

      Steps 9-10 of FIGURE 29.16: Hydrolysis and Isomerization
      Hydrolysis of the phosphate group at C1 of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate gives fructose 6-phosphate. Although
      the result of the reaction is the exact opposite of step 3 in glycolysis, the mechanism is not. In glycolysis,
      phosphorylation is accomplished by reaction of fructose with ATP, with formation of ADP as by-product. The
      reverse of that process, however--the reaction of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate with ADP to give fructose
      6-phosphate and ATP--is energetically unfavorable because ATP is too high in energy. Thus, an alternative
      pathway is used in which the C1 phosphate group is removed by a direct hydrolysis reaction, catalyzed by
      fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.
      Following hydrolysis, keto-enol tautomerization of the carbonyl group from C2 to C1 gives glucose 6-phosphate.

Interestingly, however, the mechanisms of the two phosphate hydrolysis reactions in steps 9 and 11 are not the
same. In step 9, water is the nucleophile, but in the glucose 6-phosphate reaction of step 11, a histidine residue
on the enzyme attacks phosphorus, giving a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate that subsequently reacts with
water.

29.9 Catabolism of Proteins: Deamination

The catabolism of proteins is much more complex than that of fats and carbohydrates because each of the 20
-amino acids is degraded through its own unique pathway. The general idea, however, is that (1) the  amino
group is first removed as ammonia by a deamination process, (2) the ammonia is converted into urea, and (3)
the remaining amino acid carbon skeleton (usually an -keto acid) is converted into a compound that enters the
citric acid cycle.

Transamination

Deamination is usually accomplished by a transamination reaction in which the -NH2 group of the amino
acid is exchanged with the keto group of -ketoglutarate, forming a new -keto acid plus glutamate. The overall
process occurs in two parts, is catalyzed by aminotransferases, and involves participation of the coenzyme
pyridoxal phosphate, abbreviated PLP, a derivative of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). The aminotransferases differ in
their specificity for amino acids, but the mechanism remains the same.
1090  29 · The Organic Chemistry of Metabolic Pathways

      The mechanism of the first part of transamination is shown in FIGURE 29.17. The process begins with reaction
      between the -amino acid and pyridoxal phosphate, which is covalently bonded to the aminotransferase by

      an imine linkage between the side-chain -NH2 group of a lysine residue in the enzyme and the PLP aldehyde
      group. Deprotonation/reprotonation of the PLP-amino acid imine effects tautomerization of the imine
      bond, and hydrolysis of the tautomerized imine gives an -keto acid plus pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP).

Mechanism for the enzyme-catalyzed, PLP-dependent transamination of an -amino acid to
give an -keto acid. Individual steps are explained in the text.

      to give a PLP-amino acid imine plus expelled enzyme as the leaving group. The reaction occurs by nucleophilic

      addition of the amino acid -NH2 group to the      bond of the PLP imine, much as an amine adds to the

             bond of a ketone or aldehyde in a nucleophilic addition reaction (Section 19.8). The protonated diamine

      intermediate undergoes a proton transfer and expels the lysine amino group in the enzyme to complete the

      step.

      Steps 2-4 of FIGURE 29.17: Tautomerization and Hydrolysis

      Following formation of the PLP-amino acid imine in step 1, a tautomerization of the  bond occurs in step 2.

      The basic lysine residue in the enzyme that was expelled as a leaving group during transimination deprotonates
      the acidic  position of the amino acid, with the protonated pyridine ring of PLP acting as the electron acceptor.

      Reprotonation occurs on the carbon atom next to the ring, generating a tautomeric product that is the imine of
      an -keto acid with pyridoxamine phosphate, abbreviated PMP.

      Hydrolysis of this PMP--keto acid imine then completes the first part of the transamination reaction. This is
      the mechanistic reverse of imine formation and occurs by nucleophilic addition of water to the imine, followed
      by proton transfer and expulsion of PMP as leaving group.

Regeneration of PLP from PMP

With PLP plus the -amino acid now converted into PMP plus an -keto acid, PMP must be transformed

back into PLP to complete the catalytic cycle. The conversion occurs by another transamination reaction, this

one between PMP and an -keto acid, usually -ketoglutarate. The products are PLP plus glutamate, and the

mechanism is the exact reverse of that shown in FIGURE 29.17. That is, PMP and -ketoglutarate give an imine;

the PMP--ketoglutarate imine undergoes tautomerization of the  bond to give a PLP-glutamate imine;

and the PLP-glutamate imine reacts with a lysine residue on the enzyme in a transimination process to yield

PLP-enzyme imine plus glutamate.

      29.10 Some Conclusions about Biological Chemistry

      As promised in the chapter introduction, the past few sections have been a fast-paced tour of a large number of
      reactions. Following it all undoubtedly required a lot of work and a lot of page-turning to look at earlier sections.

      After examining the various metabolic pathways, perhaps the main conclusion about biological chemistry is
      the remarkable similarity between the mechanisms of biological reactions and the mechanisms of laboratory
      reactions. If you were to look at the steps of vitamin B12 biosynthesis, you would see the same kinds of reactions
      we've been seeing throughout the text--nucleophilic substitutions, eliminations, aldol reactions, nucleophilic
      acyl substitutions, and so forth. There are, of course, some complexities, but the fundamental mechanisms of
      organic chemistry remain the same, whether in the laboratory with smaller molecules or in organisms with
      larger molecules.

      So what is there to be learned from studying metabolism? One good answer is given in the following Chemistry
      Matters, which relates the story of how knowledge of a biosynthetic pathway led to the design of new drugs that
      have saved millions of lives.

     CHEMISTRY MATTERS

Statin Drugs

Coronary heart disease--the buildup of cholesterol-containing plaques on the walls of heart arteries--is the
leading cause of death for people older than 20 in industrialized countries. It's estimated that up to one-third of
women and one-half of men will develop the disease at some point in their lives.
The onset of coronary heart disease is directly correlated with blood cholesterol levels (see the Chapter 27
Chemistry Matters), and the first step in disease prevention is to lower those levels. It turns out that only
about 25% of your blood cholesterol comes from what you eat; the remaining 75%--about 1 gram each day--is
biosynthesized in your liver from dietary fats and carbohydrates. Thus, any effective plan for lowering your
cholesterol level means limiting the amount that your body makes, which is where a detailed chemical
knowledge of cholesterol biosynthesis comes in.

FIGURE 29.18 The buildup of cholesterol deposits inside arteries can cause coronary heart disease, a leading cause of death for adults
in industrialized nations.

We saw in Section 27.5 and Section 27.7 that all steroids, including cholesterol, are biosynthesized from the
triterpenoid lanosterol, which in turn comes from acetyl CoA through isopentenyl diphosphate. If you knew all
the mechanisms for all the chemical steps in cholesterol biosynthesis, you might be able to devise a drug that
would block one of those steps, thereby short-circuiting the biosynthetic process and controlling the amount of
cholesterol produced.
But we do know those mechanisms! Look back at the pathway for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate
from acetyl CoA, shown in FIGURE 27.8. It turns out that the rate-limiting step in the pathway is the reduction
of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (abbreviated HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, brought about by the enzyme HMG-
CoA reductase. If that enzyme could be stopped from functioning, cholesterol biosynthesis would also be
stopped.
1096 29 · Key Terms

To find a drug that blocks HMG-CoA reductase, chemists did two simultaneous experiments on a large number
of potential drug candidates isolated from soil microbes. In one experiment, the drug candidate and mevalonate
were added to liver extract; in the second experiment, only the drug candidate was added without mevalonate.
If cholesterol was produced only in the presence of added mevalonate but not in the absence of mevalonate, the
drug candidate must have blocked the enzyme for mevalonate synthesis.
The drugs that block HMG-CoA reductase, and thus control cholesterol synthesis in the body, are called statins.
In just the 10-year period following their introduction in 1994, the death rate from coronary heart disease
decreased by 33% in the United States.
Like many drugs, statins don't come without risks and have some serious side effects that people considering
their use should be aware of, but approaching 30 years later, they remain among the most widely prescribed
drugs in the world, with estimated annual sales of $14 billion. Atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor),
rosuvastatin (Crestor), pravastatin (Pravachol), and lovastatin (Mevacor) are some examples. An X-ray crystal
structure of the active site in the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme is shown in the accompanying graphic, along with
a molecule of atorvastatin (purple) that is tightly bound in the active site and stops the enzyme from functioning.
A good understanding of organic chemistry certainly paid off in this instance.

                            29 · Additional Problems 1097

smaller fragments are called catabolism, and those that build up large molecules from small pieces are called
anabolism. Although the details of specific biochemical pathways are sometimes complex, all the reactions that
occur follow the normal rules of organic chemical reactivity.

The catabolism of fats begins with digestion, in which ester bonds are hydrolyzed to give glycerol and fatty acids.
The fatty acids are degraded in the four-step -oxidation pathway by removal of two carbons at a time, yielding
acetyl CoA. Catabolism of carbohydrates begins with the hydrolysis of glycoside bonds to give glucose, which is
degraded in the ten-step glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate, the initial product of glycolysis, is then converted into
acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA next enters the eight-step citric acid cycle, where it is further degraded into CO2. The
cycle is a closed loop of reactions in which the product of the final step (oxaloacetate) is a reactant in the first
step.

Catabolism of proteins is more complex than that of fats or carbohydrates because each of the 20 different

amino acids is degraded by its own unique pathway. In general, though, the amino nitrogen atoms are removed

and the substances that remain are converted into compounds that enter the citric acid cycle. Most amino acids

lose their nitrogen atom by transamination, a reaction in which the -NH2 group of the amino acid trades places
with the keto group of an -keto acid such as -ketoglutarate. The products are a new -keto acid and glutamate.

The energy released in catabolic pathways is used in the electron-transport chain to make molecules of
adenosine triphosphate, ATP. ATP, the final result of food catabolism, couples to and drives many otherwise
unfavorable reactions.

Biomolecules are synthesized as well as degraded, but the pathways for anabolism and catabolism are not
the exact reverse of one another. Fatty acids are biosynthesized from acetate by an 8-step pathway, and
carbohydrates are made from pyruvate by the 11-step gluconeogenesis pathway.

WHY THIS CHAPTER? Broad outlines of both polar and radical reactions have been in place for more than a
century, but our understanding of pericyclic reactions has emerged more recently. Prior to the mid-1960s, in
fact, they were even occasionally referred to as "no-mechanism reactions." They occur largely in the laboratory
rather than in biological processes, but a knowledge of them is necessary, both for completeness in studying
organic chemistry and in understanding biological pathways where they do occur.
Most organic reactions take place by polar mechanisms, in which a nucleophile donates two electrons to
an electrophile in forming a new bond. Other reactions take place by radical mechanisms, in which each
of two reactants donates one electron in forming a new bond. Both kinds of reactions occur frequently in
the laboratory and in living organisms. Less common, however, is the third major class of organic
reactions--pericyclic reactions.
1106  30 · Orbitals and Organic Chemistry: Pericyclic Reactions

      A pericyclic reaction is one that occurs by a concerted process through a cyclic transition state. A concerted
      reaction is one in which all bonding changes occur simultaneously; no intermediates are involved. Rather than
      try to expand this definition now, we'll begin by briefly reviewing some of the ideas of molecular orbital theory
      introduced in the chapters on Structure and Bonding and Conjugated Compounds and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy
      and then looking individually at the three main classes of pericyclic reactions: electrocyclic reactions,
      cycloadditions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.

      30.1 Molecular Orbitals of Conjugated Pi Systems

      A conjugated polyene, as we saw in Section 14.1, is one with alternating double and single bonds. According to
      molecular orbital (MO) theory, the p orbitals on the sp2-hybridized carbons of a conjugated polyene interact to
      form a set of  molecular orbitals whose energies depend on the number of nodes they have between nuclei.
      Molecular orbitals with fewer nodes are lower in energy than isolated p atomic orbitals and are bonding MOs;
      molecular orbitals with more nodes are higher in energy than isolated p orbitals and are antibonding MOs. Pi
      molecular orbitals of ethylene and 1,3-butadiene are shown in FIGURE 30.2.

                                                 FIGURE 30.2 Pi molecular orbitals of (a) ethylene and (b) 1,3-butadiene.

      A similar sort of molecular orbital description can be derived for any conjugated  electron system.
      1,3,5-Hexatriene, for example, has three double bonds and six  MOs, as shown in FIGURE 30.3. In the ground
      state, only the three bonding orbitals, 1, 2, and 3, are filled. On irradiation with ultraviolet light, however, an
      electron is promoted from the highest-energy filled orbital (3) to the lowest-energy unfilled orbital (4*) to give
      an excited state (Section 14.7), in which 3 and 4* are each half-filled. (An asterisk denotes an antibonding
      orbital.)

      What do molecular orbitals and their nodes have to do with pericyclic reactions? The answer is, everything.
      According to a series of rules formulated in the mid-1960s by R. B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann at Harvard

      symmetries of the product MOs. In other words, the lobes of reactant MOs must be of the correct algebraic sign

the excited state, 3 and 4* are both half-filled.

The Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions require an analysis of all reactant and product
molecular orbitals, but Kenichi Fukui at Kyoto Imperial University in Japan introduced a simplified version.
Hoffman and Fukui shared a Nobel Prize for their work, and Woodward would have joined them (for his
second Nobel Prize) had he not passed away before the award was made. According to Fukui's simplified
version, we need to consider only two molecular orbitals, called the frontier orbitals. These frontier orbitals
are the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
In ground-state 1,3,5-hexatriene, for example, 3 is the HOMO and 4* is the LUMO (FIGURE 30.3). In excited-
state 1,3,5-hexatriene, however, 4* is the HOMO and 5* is the LUMO.

30.2 Electrocyclic Reactions

The best way to understand how orbital symmetry affects pericyclic reactions is to look at some examples. Let's
look first at a group of polyene rearrangements called electrocyclic reactions. An electrocyclic reaction is a
pericyclic process that involves the cyclization of a conjugated acyclic polyene. One  bond is broken, the other
 bonds change position, a new  bond is formed, and a cyclic compound results. For example, a conjugated
triene can be converted into a cyclohexadiene, and a conjugated diene can be converted into a cyclobutene.
1108  30 · Orbitals and Organic Chemistry: Pericyclic Reactions

      Pericyclic reactions are reversible, and the position of the equilibrium depends on the specific case. In general,
      the triene cyclohexadiene equilibrium favors the cyclic product, whereas the diene cyclobutene
      equilibrium favors the less strained open-chain product.

      The most striking feature of electrocyclic reactions is their stereochemistry. For example,
      (2E,4Z,6E)-2,4,6-octatriene yields only cis-5,6-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene when heated, and
      (2E,4Z,6Z)-2,4,6-octatriene yields only trans-5,6-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene. Remarkably, however, the
      stereochemical results change completely when the reactions are carried out under what are called
      photochemical, rather than thermal, conditions. Irradiation of (2E,4Z,6E)-2,4,6-octatriene with ultraviolet light
      (denoted h) yields trans-5,6-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene (FIGURE 30.4).

                FIGURE 30.4 Electrocyclic interconversions of 2,4,6-octatriene isomers and 5,6-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene isomers.

      A similar result is obtained for the thermal electrocyclic ring-opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene. The trans
      isomer yields only (2E,4E)-2,4-hexadiene when heated, and the cis isomer yields only (2E,4Z)-2,4-hexadiene.
      On UV irradiation, however, the results are opposite. Cyclization of the 2E,4E isomer under photochemical
      conditions yields cis product (FIGURE 30.5).

                 FIGURE 30.5 Electrocyclic interconversions of 2,4-hexadiene isomers and 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene isomers.

To account for these results, we need to look at the two outermost lobes of the polyene MOs--the lobes that
interact when cyclization occurs. There are two possibilities: lobes of like sign can be either on the same side of
the molecule or on opposite sides.

For a bond to form, the outermost  lobes must rotate so that favorable bonding interaction is achieved--a
positive lobe with a positive lobe or a negative lobe with a negative lobe. If two lobes of like sign are on
the same side of the molecule, the two orbitals must rotate in opposite directions--one clockwise and one
counterclockwise. This kind of motion is referred to as disrotatory.

Conversely, if lobes of like sign are on opposite sides of the molecule, both orbitals must rotate in the same
direction, either both clockwise or both counterclockwise. This kind of motion is called conrotatory.
1110  30 · Orbitals and Organic Chemistry: Pericyclic Reactions

      30.3 Stereochemistry of Thermal Electrocyclic Reactions

      How can we predict whether conrotatory or disrotatory motion will occur in a given case? According to frontier
      orbital theory, the stereochemistry of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the polyene
      HOMO. The electrons in the HOMO are the highest-energy, most loosely held electrons and are therefore most
      easily moved during reaction. For thermal reactions, the ground-state electron configuration is used to identify
      the HOMO; for photochemical reactions, the excited-state electron configuration is used.

      Let's look again at the thermal ring-closure of conjugated trienes. According to FIGURE 30.3, the HOMO of
      a conjugated triene in its ground state has lobes of like sign on the same side of the molecule, a symmetry
      that predicts disrotatory ring-closure. This disrotatory cyclization is precisely what is observed in the thermal
      cyclization of 2,4,6-octatriene. The 2E,4Z,6E isomer yields cis product; the 2E,4Z,6Z isomer yields trans
      product (FIGURE 30.6).

                                     FIGURE 30.6 Thermal cyclizations of 2,4,6-octatrienes occur by disrotatory ring-closures.

      In the same way, the ground-state HOMO of conjugated dienes (FIGURE 30.2) has a symmetry that predicts
      conrotatory ring-closure. In practice, however, the conjugated diene reaction can be observed only in the
      reverse direction (cyclobutene diene) because of the position of the equilibrium. We therefore find that
      the 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene ring opens in a conrotatory fashion. cis-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene yields
      (2E,4Z)-2,4-hexadiene, and trans-3,4-dimethylcyclobutene yields (2E,4E)-2,4-hexadiene by conrotatory
      opening (FIGURE 30.7).

Note that a conjugated diene and a conjugated triene react with opposite stereochemistry. The diene opens
and closes by a conrotatory path, whereas the triene opens and closes by a disrotatory path. This is due to the
different symmetries of the diene and triene HOMOs.

It turns out that there is an alternating relationship between the number of electron pairs (double bonds)
undergoing bond reorganization and the stereochemistry of ring-opening or -closure. Polyenes with an even
number of electron pairs undergo thermal electrocyclic reactions in a conrotatory sense, whereas polyenes with
an odd number of electron pairs undergo the same reactions in a disrotatory sense.

PROBLEM trans-3,4-Dimethylcyclobutene can open by two conrotatory paths to give either

                allowed, and then account for the fact that only the 2E,4E isomer is obtained in practice.

30.4 Photochemical Electrocyclic Reactions

We noted previously that photochemical electrocyclic reactions take a different stereochemical course than
their thermal counterparts, and we can now explain this difference. Ultraviolet irradiation of a polyene causes
an excitation of one electron from the ground-state HOMO to the ground-state LUMO, thus changing their
symmetries. But because electronic excitation changes the symmetries of HOMO and LUMO, it also changes
the reaction stereochemistry. (2E,4E)-2,4-Hexadiene, for instance, undergoes photochemical cyclization by a
disrotatory path, whereas the thermal reaction is conrotatory. Similarly, (2E,4Z,6E)-2,4,6-octatriene undergoes
photochemical cyclization by a conrotatory path, whereas the thermal reaction is disrotatory (FIGURE 30.8).

FIGURE 30.8 Photochemical cyclizations of conjugated dienes and trienes. The two processes occur with different stereochemistry

1112  30 · Orbitals and Organic Chemistry: Pericyclic Reactions

      Thermal and photochemical electrocyclic reactions always take place with opposite stereochemistry because
      the symmetries of the frontier orbitals are always different. TABLE 30.1 gives some simple rules that make it
      possible to predict the stereochemistry of electrocyclic reactions.

      30.5 Cycloaddition Reactions

      A cycloaddition reaction is one in which two unsaturated molecules add to one another to yield a cyclic
      product. As with electrocyclic reactions, cycloadditions are governed by the orbital symmetry of the reactants.
      Symmetry-allowed processes often take place readily, but symmetry-disallowed processes take place with
      difficulty, if at all, and then only by nonconcerted pathways. Let's look at two examples to see how they differ.

      As we saw in Section 14.4, the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction is a pericyclic process that takes place
      between a diene (four  electrons) and a dienophile (two  electrons) to yield a cyclohexene product. Many
      thousands of Diels-Alder reactions are known. They often take place easily at room temperature or slightly
      above, and they are stereospecific with respect to substituents. For example, room-temperature reaction
      between 1,3-butadiene and diethyl maleate (cis) exclusively yields the cis-disubstituted cyclohexene product. A
      similar reaction between 1,3-butadiene and diethyl fumarate (trans) exclusively yields the trans-disubstituted
      product.

      In contrast to the [4 + 2]--electron Diels-Alder reaction, the [2 + 2]--electron cycloaddition between two
      alkenes does not occur thermally. The [2 + 2] cycloaddition takes place only on irradiation, yielding cyclobutane
      products.

                                                                                                                                  30.6 · Stereochemistry of Cycloadditions  1113

For a successful cycloaddition, the terminal  lobes of the two reactants must have the correct symmetry
for bonding to occur. This can happen in either of two ways, called suprafacial and antarafacial. Suprafacial
cycloadditions take place when a bonding interaction occurs between lobes on the same face of one reactant
and lobes on the same face of the other reactant. Antarafacial cycloadditions take place when a bonding
interaction occurs between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on opposite faces of the other
reactant (FIGURE 30.9).

FIGURE 30.9 (a) Suprafacial cycloaddition occurs when there is bonding between lobes on the same face of one reactant and lobes on
the same face of the other reactant. (b) Antarafacial cycloaddition occurs when there is bonding between lobes on the same face of
one reactant and lobes on opposite faces of the other, which requires a twist in one  system.

Note that both suprafacial and antarafacial cycloadditions are symmetry-allowed. Geometric constraints often
make antarafacial reactions difficult, however, because there must be a twisting of the  orbital system in one of
the reactants. Thus, suprafacial cycloadditions are much more common for small  systems.

30.6 Stereochemistry of Cycloadditions

How can we predict whether a given cycloaddition reaction will occur with suprafacial or with antarafacial
geometry? According to frontier orbital theory, a cycloaddition reaction takes place when a bonding interaction
occurs between the HOMO of one reactant and the LUMO of the other. An intuitive explanation of this rule is to
imagine that one reactant donates electrons to the other. As with electrocyclic reactions, it's the electrons in the
HOMO of the first reactant that are least tightly held and most likely to be donated. Of course when the second
reactant accepts those electrons, they must go into a vacant, unoccupied orbital--the LUMO.

For a [4 + 2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction), let's arbitrarily select the diene LUMO and the alkene HOMO.
The symmetries of the two ground-state orbitals are such that bonding of the terminal lobes can occur with
suprafacial geometry (FIGURE 30.10), so the Diels-Alder reaction takes place readily under thermal conditions.
Note that, as with electrocyclic reactions, we need be concerned only with the terminal lobes. For purposes of
prediction, interactions among the interior lobes need not be considered.

          FIGURE 30.10 Interaction of diene LUMO and alkene HOMO in a suprafacial [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction (Diels-Alder reaction).

      In contrast with the thermal [4 + 2] Diels-Alder reaction, the [2 + 2] cycloaddition of two alkenes to yield
      a cyclobutane can only occur photochemically. The explanation for this follows from orbital-symmetry
      arguments. Looking at the ground-state HOMO of one alkene and the LUMO of the second alkene, it's apparent
      that a thermal [2 + 2] cycloaddition must take place by an antarafacial pathway (FIGURE 30.11a). Geometric
      constraints make the antarafacial transition state difficult, however, and so concerted thermal [2 + 2]
      cycloadditions are not observed.

      In contrast with the thermal process, photochemical [2 + 2] cycloadditions are observed. Irradiation of an alkene
      with UV light excites an electron from 1, the ground-state HOMO, to 2*, which becomes the excited-state
      HOMO. Interaction between the excited-state HOMO of one alkene and the LUMO of the second alkene allows a
      photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction to occur by a suprafacial pathway (FIGURE 30.11b).

      FIGURE 30.11 (a) Interaction of a ground-state HOMO and a ground-state LUMO in a potential [2 + 2] cycloaddition does not occur
      thermally because the antarafacial geometry is too strained. (b) Interaction of an excited-state HOMO and a ground-state LUMO in a
      photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is less strained, however, and occurs with suprafacial geometry.

      The photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction occurs smoothly, particularly with ,-unsaturated carbonyl
      compounds, and represents one of the best methods known for synthesizing cyclobutane rings. For example:

Thermal and photochemical cycloaddition reactions always take place with opposite stereochemistry. As with
electrocyclic reactions, we can categorize cycloadditions according to the total number of electron pairs (double
bonds) involved in the rearrangement. Thus, a thermal [4 + 2] Diels-Alder reaction between a diene and a
dienophile involves an odd number (three) of electron pairs and takes place by a suprafacial pathway. A thermal
[2 + 2] reaction between two alkenes involves an even number (two) of electron pairs and must take place by an
antarafacial pathway. For photochemical cyclizations, these selectivities are reversed. These general rules are
given in TABLE 30.2.

30.7 Sigmatropic Rearrangements

A sigmatropic rearrangement, the third general kind of pericyclic reaction, is a process in which a -bonded
substituent atom or group migrates across a  electron system from one position to another. A  bond is broken
in the reactant, the  bonds move, and a new  bond is formed in the product. The -bonded group can be either
at the end or in the middle of the  system, as the following [1,5] and [3,3] rearrangements illustrate:
1116  30 · Orbitals and Organic Chemistry: Pericyclic Reactions

      The notations [1,5] and [3,3] describe the kind of rearrangement that is occurring. The numbers refer to the two
      groups connected by the  bond in the reactant and designate the positions in those groups to which migration
      occurs. For example, in the [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,3-diene, the two groups connected by the
       bond are a hydrogen atom and a pentadienyl group. Migration occurs to position 1 of the H group (the only
      possibility) and to position 5 of the pentadienyl group. In the [3,3] rearrangement of an allylic vinylic ether, the
      two groups connected by the  bond are an allylic group and the vinylic ether. Migration occurs to position 3 of
      the allylic group and also to position 3 of the vinylic ether.

      Like electrocyclic reactions and cycloadditions, sigmatropic rearrangements are controlled by orbital
      symmetries. There are two possible modes of reaction: migration of a group across the same face of the  system
      is suprafacial, and migration of a group from one face of the  system to the other face is antarafacial (FIGURE
      30.12).

30.8 Some Examples of Sigmatropic Rearrangements

Because a [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangement involves three electron pairs (two  bonds and one  bond), the
orbital-symmetry rules in TABLE 30.3 predict a suprafacial reaction. In fact, the [1,5] suprafacial shift of a
hydrogen atom across two double bonds of a  system is a commonly observed sigmatropic rearrangements.
For example, 5-methyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene rapidly rearranges at room temperature to yield a mixture of
1-methyl-, 2-methyl-, and 5-methyl-isomers.

As another example, heating 5,5,5-trideuterio-(3Z)-1,3-pentadiene causes scrambling of deuterium between
1118  30 · Orbitals and Organic Chemistry: Pericyclic Reactions

      positions 1 and 5.

      Both these [1,5] hydrogen shifts occur by a symmetry-allowed suprafacial pathway, as illustrated in FIGURE
      30.13. In contrast with these thermal [1,5] sigmatropic hydrogen shifts, however, thermal [1,3] hydrogen shifts
      are unknown. If they were to occur, they would have to proceed by a strained antarafacial reaction pathway.

                  FIGURE 30.13 An orbital view of a suprafacial [1,5] hydrogen shift.

      Two other important sigmatropic reactions are the Claisen rearrangement of either an allyl aryl ether

      (           ) or an allyl vinyl (                          ) ether, and the Cope rearrangement of

      a 1,5 hexadiene to an isomeric 1,5-diene. These two rearrangements, along with the Diels-Alder reaction, are

      among the most generally useful pericyclic reactions for organic synthesis. Thousands of examples of all three

      are known.

      Like the Diels-Alder reaction discussed in Section 14.4 and Section 14.5, the Claisen rearrangement takes
      place in a single step through a pericyclic mechanism in which a reorganization of bonding electrons occurs
      in a six-membered, cyclic transition state. The 6-allyl-2,4-cyclohexadienone intermediate then isomerizes to
      o-allylphenol (FIGURE 30.14).

yields o-allylphenol in which the label is on the terminal vinylic carbon (green in FIGURE 30.14).
PROBLEM Draw a curved-arrow mechanism for the Cope arrangement just shown.

        30-8

The Cope rearrangement that converts a 1,5-diene to an isomeric 1,5-diene is somewhat limited but a
modification called the Oxy Cope Rearrangement is wider in scope. As shown in the following example, a 1-5
diene with an -OH next to the double bond can be converted into an oxy-anion by reaction with a strong base
such as potassium hydride (KH). A Cope rearrangement then occurs, and reaction with aqueous acid gives an
enol that tautomerizes to an aldehyde.

Although biological examples of pericyclic reactions are relatively rare, a much-studied example occurs in
bacteria during biosynthesis of the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Phenylalanine arises from the
precursor chorismate through a Claisen rearrangement to prephenate, followed by decarboxylation to
phenylpyruvate and reductive amination (FIGURE 30.16). You might note that the reductive amination of
phenylpyruvate is the exact reverse of the transamination process shown in FIGURE 29.17, by which amino
acids are deaminated. In addition, the reductive amination of ketones is a standard method for preparing
amines in the laboratory, as we saw in Section 24.6.

30.9 A Summary of Rules for Pericyclic Reactions

How can you keep straight all the rules about pericyclic reactions? The summary in TABLE 30.1, TABLE
30.2, and TABLE 30.3 can be distilled into a mnemonic phrase that provides an easy way to predict the
stereochemical outcome of any pericyclic reaction:

             The Electrons Circle Around (TECA)

             Thermal reactions with an Even number of electron
                      pairs are Conrotatory or Antarafacial.

A change either from thermal to photochemical or from an even to an odd number of electron pairs changes
the outcome from conrotatory/antarafacial to disrotatory/suprafacial. A change from both thermal and even to
photochemical and odd causes no change because two negatives make a positive.

These selection rules are summarized in TABLE 30.4; knowing them gives you the ability to predict the
stereochemistry of literally thousands of pericyclic reactions.

Vitamin D, the Sunshine Vitamin

Vitamin D, discovered in 1918, is a general name for two related compounds, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)
and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Both are derived from steroids (Section 27.6) and differ only in the nature of
the hydrocarbon side chain attached to the five-membered ring. Cholecalciferol comes primarily from dairy
products and fish; ergocalciferol comes from some vegetables.

  FIGURE 30.17 Here are the sunbathers, again, with their chemical work complete. (credit: "Tanning" by Meraj Chhaya/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

The function of vitamin D in the body is to control the calcification of bones by increasing intestinal absorption
of calcium. When sufficient vitamin D is present, approximately 30% of ingested calcium is absorbed, but in the
absence of vitamin D, calcium absorption falls to about 10%. A deficiency of vitamin D thus leads to poor bone
growth and to the diseases rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults.
Actually, neither vitamin D2 nor D3 is present in foods. Rather, foods contain the precursor molecules
7-dehydrocholesterol and ergosterol. In the presence of sunlight, both precursors are converted in the outer,
epidermal layer of skin to the active vitamins, hence the nickname for vitamin D, the "sunshine vitamin."

Pericyclic reactions are unusual in living organisms, and the photochemical synthesis of vitamin D is one of
only a few well-studied examples. The reaction takes place in two steps, an electrocyclic ring-opening of a
cyclohexadiene to yield an open-chain hexatriene, followed by a sigmatropic [1,7] H shift to yield an isomeric
hexatriene. Only the initial electrocyclic ring-opening requires irradiation by so-called UVB light of 295 to 300
nm wavelength. The subsequent sigmatropic [1,7] H shift occurs spontaneously by a thermal isomerization.
Following synthesis under the skin, further metabolic processing of cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol in the
liver and kidney introduces two additional -OH groups to give the active forms of the vitamin, calcitriol and
ergocalcitriol.

Summary

A pericyclic reaction takes place in a single step through a cyclic transition state without intermediates.
There are three major classes of pericyclic processes: electrocyclic reactions, cycloaddition reactions, and
sigmatropic rearrangements. The stereochemistry of these reactions is controlled by the symmetry of the
orbitals involved in bond reorganization.

Electrocyclic reactions involve the cyclization of conjugated acyclic polyenes. For example, 1,3,5-hexatriene
cyclizes to 1,3-cyclohexadiene on heating. Electrocyclic reactions can occur by either conrotatory or
disrotatory pathways, depending on the symmetry of the terminal lobes of the  system. Conrotatory
cyclization requires that both lobes rotate in the same direction, whereas disrotatory cyclization requires that
the lobes rotate in opposite directions. The reaction course in a specific case can be found by looking at the
symmetry of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).

Cycloaddition reactions are those in which two unsaturated molecules add together to yield a cyclic product.
For example, Diels-Alder reaction between a diene (four  electrons) and a dienophile (two  electrons) yields
a cyclohexene. Cycloadditions can take place either by suprafacial or antarafacial pathways. Suprafacial
cycloaddition involves interaction between lobes on the same face of one component and on the same face of
the second component. Antarafacial cycloaddition involves interaction between lobes on the same face of one
component and on opposite faces of the other component. The reaction course in a specific case can be found by
looking at the symmetry of the HOMO of one component and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
of the other.

Sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a -bonded group across a  electron system. For
example, Claisen rearrangement of an allylic vinylic ether yields an unsaturated carbonyl compound, and Cope
rearrangement of a 1,5-hexadiene yields an isomeric 1,5-hexadiene. Sigmatropic rearrangements can occur
with either suprafacial or antarafacial stereochemistry; the selection rules for a given case are the same as those
for cycloaddition reactions.

The stereochemistry of any pericyclic reaction can be predicted by counting the total number of electron pairs
(bonds) involved in bond reorganization and then applying the mnemonic "The Electrons Circle Around." That
is, thermal (ground-state) reactions involving an even number of electron pairs occur with either conrotatory
or antarafacial stereochemistry. Exactly the opposite rules apply to photochemical (excited-state) reactions.

31.7 Polymer Structure and Physical Properties
WHY THIS CHAPTER? Our treatment of polymers has thus far been dispersed over several chapters, but it's also
important to take a comprehensive view. In the present chapter, we'll look further at how polymers are made,
and we'll see how polymer structure correlates with physical properties. No course in organic chemistry would
be complete without a look at polymers.
Polymers are a fundamental part of the modern world, used in everything from coffee cups to cars to clothing. In
medicine, too, their importance is growing, with uses as diverse as cardiac pacemakers, artificial heart valves,
and biodegradable sutures.
We've seen on several occasions in previous chapters that a polymer, whether synthetic or biological, is a large
molecule built up by repetitive bonding of many smaller units, or monomers. Polyethylene, for instance, is a
synthetic polymer made from ethylene (Section 8.10), nylon is a synthetic polyamide made from a diacid and a
diamine (Section 21.9), and proteins are biological polyamides made from amino acids. Note that polymers are
1132  31 · Synthetic Polymers

      often drawn by indicating their repeating unit in parentheses. The repeating unit in polystyrene, for example,
      comes from the monomer styrene.

      31.1 Chain-Growth Polymers

      Synthetic polymers are classified by their method of synthesis as either chain-growth or step-growth. These
      categories are somewhat imprecise but nevertheless provide a useful distinction. Chain-growth polymers are
      produced by chain-reaction polymerization in which an initiator adds to the carbon-carbon double bond of
      an unsaturated substrate (a vinyl monomer) to yield a reactive intermediate. This intermediate reacts with a
      second molecule of monomer to yield a new intermediate, which reacts with a third monomer unit, and so on.

      The initiator can be a radical, an acid, or a base. Historically, as we saw in Section 8.10, radical polymerization
      was the most common method because it can be carried out with practically any vinyl monomer.

      Acid-catalyzed (cationic) polymerization, by contrast, is effective only with vinyl monomers that contain an
      electron-donating group (EDG) capable of stabilizing the chain-carrying carbocation intermediate.

      Isobutylene (2-methylpropene) is a good example of a monomer that polymerizes rapidly under cationic
      conditions. The reaction is carried out commercially at -80 °C, using BF3 and a small amount of water to
      generate BF3OH- H+ catalyst. The product is used in the manufacture of truck and bicycle inner tubes.

      Vinyl monomers with electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) can be polymerized by basic (anionic) catalysts. The
      chain-carrying step is a conjugate nucleophilic addition of an anion to the unsaturated monomer (Section
      19.13).

      Acrylonitrile (                  ), methyl methacrylate [  ], and styrene (  ) can

      all be polymerized anionically. The polystyrene used in foam coffee cups, for example, is prepared by anionic

polymerization of styrene using butyllithium as catalyst.

An interesting example of anionic polymerization accounts for the remarkable properties of "super glue," one
drop of which can support up to 2000 lb. Super glue is simply a solution of pure methyl -cyanoacrylate, which
has two electron-withdrawing groups that make anionic addition particularly easy. Trace amounts of water or
bases on the surface of an object are sufficient to initiate polymerization of the cyanoacrylate and bind articles
together. Skin is a good source of the necessary basic initiators, and many people have found their fingers
stuck together after inadvertently touching super glue. So good is super glue at binding tissues that related
cyanoacrylate esters such as Dermabond are often used in place of sutures to close wounds.

31.2 Stereochemistry of Polymerization: Ziegler-Natta Catalysts

Although we didn't point it out when discussing chain-growth polymers in Section 8.10, the polymerization of
a substituted vinyl monomer can lead to a polymer with numerous chirality centers in its chain. Propylene, for
example, might polymerize with any of the three stereochemical outcomes shown in FIGURE 31.2. A polymer
with all methyl groups on the same side of the zigzag backbone is called isotactic, one in which the methyl
groups alternate regularly on opposite sides of the backbone is called syndiotactic, and one with its methyl
groups randomly oriented is called atactic.
1134  31 · Synthetic Polymers

                                                 FIGURE 31.2 Isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic forms of polypropylene.

      The three different stereochemical forms of polypropylene all have somewhat different properties, and all can
      be made by using the right polymerization catalyst. Propylene polymerization using radical initiators does not
      work well, but polymerization using Ziegler-Natta catalysts allows preparation of isotactic, syndiotactic, and
      atactic polypropylene.
      Ziegler-Natta catalysts--there are many different formulations--are organometallic transition-metal
      complexes prepared by treatment of an alkylaluminum with a titanium compound. Triethylaluminum with
      titanium tetrachloride is a typical preparation.

      Following their introduction in 1953, Ziegler-Natta catalysts revolutionized the field of polymer chemistry
      because of two advantages: first, the resultant polymers are linear, with practically no chain branching, and
      second, they are stereochemically controllable. Isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic forms can all be produced,
      depending on the catalyst system used.
      The active form of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst is an alkyltitanium intermediate with a vacant coordination site on
      the metal. Coordination of alkene monomer to the titanium occurs, and the coordinated alkene then inserts into
      the carbon-titanium bond to extend the alkyl chain. A new coordination site opens up during the insertion step,
      so the process repeats indefinitely.

      The linear polyethylene produced by the Ziegler-Natta process, called high-density polyethylene, is a highly
      crystalline polymer with 4000 to 7000 ethylene units per chain and molecular weights in the range 100,000 to
      200,000 amu. High-density polyethylene has greater strength and heat resistance than the branched product of
      radical-induced polymerization, called low-density polyethylene, and is used to produce plastic squeeze bottles
      and molded housewares.
      Polyethylenes of even higher molecular weights are produced for specialty applications. So-called high-
      molecular-weight (HMW) polyethylene contains 10,000 to 18,000 monomer units per chain and molecular
      weights in the range of 300,000-500,000. It is used for underground pipes and large containers. Ultrahigh-
      molecular-weight (UHMW) polyethylene contains more than 100,000 monomer units per chain and has
      molecular weights ranging from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 amu. It is used in bearings, conveyor belts, and
      bulletproof vests, among other applications requiring exceptional wear resistance.

        31-5 expect samples of isotactic, syndiotactic, or atactic polypropylene to rotate plane-polarized light?
                 Explain.

31.3 Copolymers

Up to this point we've discussed only homopolymers--polymers that are made up of identical repeating units.
In practice, however, copolymers are more important commercially. Copolymers are obtained when two or
more different monomers are allowed to polymerize together. For example, copolymerization of vinyl chloride
with vinylidene chloride (1,1-dichloroethylene) in a 1 : 4 ratio leads to the polymer Saran.

Copolymerization of monomer mixtures often leads to materials with properties quite different from those of
either corresponding homopolymer, giving the polymer chemist a vast flexibility for devising new materials.
TABLE 31.1 lists some common copolymers and their commercial applications.

      Styrene

      Several different types of copolymers can be defined, depending on the distribution of monomer units in
      the chain. If monomer A is copolymerized with monomer B, for instance, the resultant product might have a
      random distribution of the two units throughout the chain, or it might have an alternating distribution.

      The exact distribution of monomer units depends on the initial proportions of the two reactant monomers and
      their relative reactivities. In practice, neither perfectly random nor perfectly alternating copolymers are usually
      found. Most copolymers have many random imperfections.

      Two other forms of copolymers that can be prepared under certain conditions are called block copolymers and
      graft copolymers. Block copolymers are those in which different blocks of identical monomer units alternate
      with each other; graft copolymers are those in which homopolymer branches of one monomer unit are
      "grafted" onto a homopolymer chain of another monomer unit.

      Block copolymers are prepared by initiating the polymerization of one monomer as if growing a homopolymer
      chain and then adding an excess of the second monomer to the still-active reaction mix. Graft copolymers are
      made by gamma irradiation of a completed homopolymer chain in the presence of the second monomer. The
      high-energy irradiation knocks hydrogen atoms off the homopolymer chain at random points, thus generating
      new radical sites that can initiate polymerization of the added monomer.

31.4 Step-Growth Polymers

Step-growth polymers are produced by reactions in which each bond in the polymer is formed stepwise,
independently of the other bonds. Like the polyamides (nylons) and polyesters that we saw in Section 21.9, most
step-growth polymers are produced by reaction between two difunctional reactants. The polymer Nylon 66, for
instance, is made by reaction between the six-carbon adipic acid and the six-carbon hexamethylenediamine
(1,6-hexanediamine). Alternatively, a single reactant with two different functional groups can polymerize.
Nylon 6 is made by polymerization of the six-carbon caprolactam. The reaction is initiated by adding a small
amount of water, which hydrolyzes some caprolactam to 6-aminohexanoic acid. Nucleophilic addition of the
amino group to caprolactam then propagates the polymerization.

Polycarbonates

Polycarbonates are like polyesters, but their carbonyl group is linked to two -OR groups, [  ]. Lexan,

for instance, is a polycarbonate prepared from diphenyl carbonate and a diphenol called bisphenol A. Lexan has

unusually high impact strength, making it valuable for use in machinery housings, telephones, bicycle safety

helmets, and bulletproof glass.

Polyurethanes

A urethane is a carbonyl-containing functional group in which the carbonyl carbon is bonded to both an -OR
group and an -NR2 group. As such, a urethane is halfway between a carbonate and a urea.
1138  31 · Synthetic Polymers

      A urethane is typically prepared by nucleophilic addition reaction of an alcohol with an isocyanate

      (  ), so a polyurethane is prepared by reaction of a diol with a diisocyanate. The diol is usually

      a low-molecular-weight polymer (MW  1000 amu) with hydroxyl end-groups; the diisocyanate is often

      toluene-2,4-diisocyanate.

      Several different kinds of polyurethanes can be produced, depending on the nature of the polymeric alcohol
      used. One major use of polyurethane is in the stretchable spandex fibers used for bathing suits and athletic gear.
      These polyurethanes have a fairly low degree of cross-linking so that the resultant polymer is soft and elastic. A
      second major use of polyurethanes is in the foams used for insulation. Foaming occurs when a small amount of
      water is added during polymerization, giving a carbamic acid intermediate that spontaneously loses bubbles of
      CO2.

      Polyurethane foams are generally made using a polyalcohol rather than a diol as the monomer so that the
      polymer has a high amount of three-dimensional cross-linking. The result is a rigid but very light foam suitable
      for use as thermal insulation in building construction and portable ice chests.

      31.5 Olefin Metathesis Polymerization

      Perhaps the most important advance in polymer synthesis in recent years has been the development of olefin
      metathesis polymerization by Yves Chauvin of the Institut Français du Pétrole, Robert H. Grubbs of CalTech,
      and Richard R.Schrock of MIT who shared the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work. At its simplest, an
      olefin metathesis reaction is two olefins (alkenes) exchanging substituents on their double bonds.

      Olefin metathesis catalysts, such as the Grubbs catalyst now in common use, contain a carbon-metal double

      Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                31.5 · Olefin Metathesis Polymerization                                           1139

bond (usually to ruthenium, Ru) and have the general structure  . They function by reacting reversibly

with an alkene to form a four-membered, metal-containing intermediate called a metallacycle, which

immediately opens to give a different catalyst and a different alkene. The mechanism is shown in FIGURE 31.3.

FIGURE 31.3 Mechanism of the olefin metathesis reaction. The process is initiated by a two-step sequence that involves (1) reaction of
the catalyst and olefin 1 to give a four-membered metallacycle intermediate, followed by (2) ring-opening to give a different form of catalyst
that contains part of olefin 1. (3) Reaction of this new catalyst with olefin 2 gives another metallacycle intermediate, (4) which opens to give
metathesis product and another form of catalyst. (5, 6) The repeating ring-forming and ring-opening steps then continue.

There are several methods for implementing the olefin metathesis reaction to prepare polymers. One method,
called ring-opening metathesis polymerization, or ROMP, involves the use of a moderately strained
cycloalkene, such as cyclopentene. The strain of the ring favors ring-opening, thereby driving formation of the
open-chain product. The polymer that results has double bonds spaced regularly along the chain, allowing for
either hydrogenation or further functionalization if desired.

A second method of using olefin metathesis to prepare polymers is by acyclic diene metathesis, or ADMET.
As the name suggests, ADMET involves olefin metathesis of an open-chain substrate with two double bonds
at the ends of a long chain, such as 1,8-nonadiene. As the reaction proceeds, the gaseous ethylene by-product
1140  31 · Synthetic Polymers

      escapes, thereby driving the equilibrium toward polymer product. So efficient is this reaction that polymers
      with molecular weights as high as 80,000 amu have been prepared.

      The ROMP and ADMET procedures are particularly valuable because the metathesis reaction is compatible with
      the presence in the olefin monomer of many different functional groups. In addition, the double bonds in the
      polymers provide still more flexibility for further manipulations. Among the commercial polymers produced
      by olefin metathesis are Vestenamer, used in the manufacture of tires and other molded rubber objects, and
      Norsorex, used in the automobile industry as a sealing material.

      PROBLEM Look at the structures of Vestenamer and Norsorex and show how they might be made by olefin
            31-10 metathesis polymerization.

      31.6 Intramolecular Olefin Metathesis

      The olefin metathesis reaction has been used primarily as an intermolecular process for polymer synthesis, but
      it is also finding increased usage in complex organic synthesis as an intramolecular process in what is called
      ring-closing metathesis (RCM). The optimum catalyst is an Ru(II) complex, and cyclic alkenes with up to 30
      atoms in ring size are easily produced.

      31.7 Polymer Structure and Physical Properties

      Polymers aren't really that different from other organic molecules. They're much larger, of course, but their
      chemistry is similar to that of analogous small molecules. Thus, the alkane chains of polyethylene undergo
      radical-initiated halogenation, the aromatic rings of polystyrene undergo typical electrophilic aromatic
      substitution reactions, and the amide linkages of nylon are hydrolyzed by aqueous base.
      The major difference between small and large organic molecules is in their physical properties. For instance,
      their large size means that polymers experience substantially greater van der Waals forces than do small
      molecules (Section 2.12). But because van der Waals forces operate only at close distances, they are strongest
      in polymers like high-density polyethylene, in which chains can pack together closely in a regular way. Many

                                                                                                                      31.7 · Polymer Structure and Physical Properties  1141

polymers, in fact, have regions that are essentially crystalline. These regions, called crystallites, consist of
highly ordered portions in which the zigzag polymer chains are held together by van der Waals forces (FIGURE
31.4).

       FIGURE 31.4 Crystallites in linear polyethylene. The long polymer chains are arranged in parallel lines in the crystallite regions.

As you might expect, polymer crystallinity is strongly affected by the steric requirements of substituent groups
on the chains. Linear polyethylene is highly crystalline, but poly(methyl methacrylate) is noncrystalline because
the chains can't pack closely together in a regular way. Polymers with a high degree of crystallinity are generally
hard and durable. When heated, the crystalline regions melt at the melt transition temperature, Tm, to give an
amorphous material.

Noncrystalline, amorphous polymers like poly(methyl methacrylate), sold under the trade name Plexiglas,
have little or no long-range ordering among chains but can nevertheless be very hard at room temperature.
When heated, the hard amorphous polymer becomes soft and flexible at a point called the glass transition
temperature, Tg. Much of the art in polymer synthesis lies in finding methods for controlling the degree of
crystallinity and the glass transition temperature, thereby imparting useful properties to the polymer.

In general, polymers can be divided into four major categories, depending on their physical behavior:
thermoplastics, fibers, elastomers, and thermosetting resins. Thermoplastics are the polymers most people
think of when the word plastic is mentioned. These polymers have a high glass transition temperature and are
therefore hard at room temperature but become soft and viscous when heated. As a result, they can be molded
into toys, beads, telephone housings, or any of a thousand other items. Because thermoplastics have little or no
cross-linking, the individual chains can slip past one another in the melt. Some thermoplastic polymers, such
as poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene, are amorphous and noncrystalline; others, such as polyethylene
and nylon, are partially crystalline. Among the better-known thermoplastics is poly(ethylene terephthalate), or
PET, used for making plastic soft-drink bottles.

Plasticizers--small organic molecules that act as lubricants between chains--are usually added to
thermoplastics to keep them from becoming brittle at room temperature. An example is poly(vinyl chloride),
which is brittle when pure but becomes supple and pliable when a plasticizer is added. In fact, most drip
bags used in hospitals to deliver intravenous saline solutions are made of poly(vinyl chloride), although
replacements such as polypropylene are appearing.

Dialkyl phthalates such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (generally called dioctyl phthalate) are commonly used as
plasticizers, although questions about their safety have been raised. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
1142  31 · Synthetic Polymers

      (FDA) has advised the use of alternative materials in compromised patients and infants but has found no
      evidence of toxicity for healthy individuals. In addition, children's toys that contain phthalates have been
      banned in the United States.

      Fibers are thin threads produced by extruding a molten polymer through small holes in a die, or spinneret.
      The fibers are then cooled and drawn out, which orients the crystallite regions along the axis of the fiber and
      adds considerable tensile strength FIGURE 31.5. Nylon, Dacron, and polyethylene all have the semicrystalline
      structure necessary for being drawn into oriented fibers.

                                                          FIGURE 31.5 Oriented crystallite regions in a polymer fiber.

      Elastomers are amorphous polymers that have the ability to stretch out and spring back to their original
      shapes. These polymers must have low glass transition temperatures and a small amount of cross-linking to
      prevent the chains from slipping over one another. In addition, the chains must have an irregular shape to
      prevent crystallite formation. When stretched, the randomly coiled chains straighten out and orient along the
      direction of the pull. Van der Waals forces are too weak and too few to maintain this orientation, however, and
      the elastomer therefore reverts to its random coiled state when the stretching force is released (FIGURE 31.6).

                                                       FIGURE 31.6 Unstretched and stretched forms of an elastomer.

      Natural rubber (Section 14.6) is the most common example of an elastomer. Rubber has the long chains and
      occasional cross-links needed for elasticity, but its irregular geometry prevents close packing of the chains into
      crystallites. Gutta-percha, by contrast, is highly crystalline and is not an elastomer (FIGURE 31.7).

FIGURE 31.7 (a) Natural rubber is elastic and noncrystalline because of its cis double-bond geometry, but (b) gutta-percha is
nonelastic and crystalline because its geometry allows for better packing together of chains.

Thermosetting resins are polymers that become highly cross-linked and solidify into a hard, insoluble mass
when heated. Bakelite, a thermosetting resin first produced in 1907, has been in commercial use longer than
any other synthetic polymer. It is widely used for molded parts, adhesives, coatings, and even high-temperature
applications such as missile nose cones.

Chemically, Bakelite is a phenolic resin, produced by reaction of phenol and formaldehyde. On heating, water
is eliminated, many cross-links form, and the polymer sets into a rocklike mass. The cross-linking in Bakelite
and other thermosetting resins is three-dimensional and is so extensive that we can't really speak of polymer
"chains." A piece of Bakelite is essentially one large molecule.

Degradable Polymers

The high chemical stability of many polymers is both a blessing and a curse. Heat resistance, wear resistance,
and long life are valuable characteristics of clothing fibers, bicycle helmets, underground pipes, food wrappers,
and many other items. Yet when these items outlive their usefulness, disposal becomes a problem.

FIGURE 31.8 What happens to the plastics that end up here? (credit: modification of work "King of the trash hill" by Alan Levine/Flickr, CC
BY 2.0)

Recycling of unwanted polymers is the best solution, and six types of plastics in common use are frequently
stamped with identifying codes assigned by the Society of the Plastics Industry TABLE 31.2. After being sorted
by type, the items to be recycled are shredded into small chips, washed, dried, and melted for reuse. Soft-drink
bottles, for instance, are made from recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate), trash bags are made from recycled
low-density polyethylene, and garden furniture is made from recycled polypropylene and mixed plastics.

Frequently, however, plastics are simply thrown away rather than recycled, and much work has therefore
been carried out on developing biodegradable polymers, which can be broken down by soil microorganisms.
Among the most common biodegradable polymers are polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA), and
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). All are polyesters and are therefore susceptible to hydrolysis of their ester links.
Copolymers of PGA with PLA have found a particularly wide range of uses. A 90/10 copolymer of polyglycolic
acid with polylactic acid is used to make absorbable sutures that are degraded and absorbed by the body within
90 days after surgery.

Biodegradation is important, but even better than the breakdown of a small group of specialized polymers
would be the development of a generalized method of breakdown that could be used on any polymer, including
even hydrocarbon polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Such a method has recently been
reported by chemists at the University of Delaware, using hydrogen at 200 °C and 2 atm pressure in the
presence of an organozirconium catalyst to turn polyethylene into simple hydrocarbons. The method uses a
large amount of hydrogen at present, but it is an impressive start.

Summary

Synthetic polymers can be classified as either chain-growth or step-growth. Chain-growth polymers are
prepared by chain-reaction polymerization of vinyl monomers in the presence of a radical, an anion, or a
cation initiator. Radical polymerization is sometimes used, but alkenes such as 2-methylpropene that have
electron-donating substituents on the double bond polymerize easily by a cationic route through carbocation
intermediates. Similarly, monomers such as methyl -cyanoacrylate that have electron-withdrawing
substituents on the double bond polymerize by an anionic, conjugate addition pathway.

Copolymerization of two monomers gives a product with properties different from those of either homopolymer.
Graft copolymers and block copolymers are two examples.

Alkene polymerization can be carried out in a controlled manner using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst. Ziegler-Natta
polymerization minimizes the amount of chain branching in the polymer and leads to stereoregular
chains--either isotactic (substituents on the same side of the chain) or syndiotactic (substituents on alternate
sides of the chain), rather than atactic (substituents randomly disposed).

Step-growth polymers, the second major class of polymers, are prepared by reactions between difunctional
molecules, with individual bonds in the polymer formed independently of one another. Polycarbonates are
formed from a diester and a diol, and polyurethanes are formed from a diisocyanate and a diol.
1146 31 · Additional Problems

The chemistry of synthetic polymers is similar to the chemistry of small molecules with the same functional
groups, but the physical properties of polymers are greatly affected by size. Polymers can be classified by
physical property into four groups: thermoplastics, fibers, elastomers, and thermosetting resins. The
properties of each group can be accounted for by the structure, the degree of crystallinity, and the amount of
cross-linking they contain.

APPENDIX A

Nomenclature of Polyfunctional Organic Compounds

With more than 40 million organic compounds now known and thousands more being created daily, naming
them all is a real problem. Part of the problem is due to the sheer complexity of organic structures, but part is
also due to the fact that chemical names have more than one purpose. For the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS),
which catalogs and indexes the worldwide chemical literature, each compound must have only one correct
name. It would be chaos if half the entries for CH3Br were indexed under "M" for methyl bromide and half under
"B" for bromomethane. Furthermore, a CAS name must be strictly systematic so that it can be assigned and
interpreted by computers; common names are not allowed.

People, however, have different requirements than computers. For people--which is to say students and
professional chemists in their spoken and written communications--it's best that a chemical name be
pronounceable and as easy as possible to assign and interpret. Furthermore, it's convenient if names follow
historical precedents, even if that means a particularly well-known compound might have more than one name.
People can readily understand that bromomethane and methyl bromide both refer to CH3Br.

As noted in the text, chemists overwhelmingly use the nomenclature system devised and maintained by the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, or IUPAC. Rules for naming monofunctional compounds
were given throughout the text as each new functional group was introduced, and a list of where these rules can
be found is given in TABLE A1.

Naming a monofunctional compound is reasonably straightforward, but even experienced chemists often

encounter problems when faced with naming a complex polyfunctional compound. Take the following

compound, for instance. It has three functional groups, ester, ketone, and   , but how should it be named?

As an ester with an -oate ending, a ketone with an -one ending, or an alkene with an -ene ending? It's actually

named methyl 3-(2-oxo-6-cyclohexenyl)propanoate.

The name of a polyfunctional organic molecule has four parts--suffix, parent, prefixes, and locants--which must
be identified and expressed in the proper order and format. Let's look at each of the four.

Name Part 1. The Suffix: Functional-Group Precedence

Although a polyfunctional organic molecule might contain several different functional groups, we must choose
just one suffix for nomenclature purposes. It's not correct to use two suffixes. Thus, keto ester 1 must be named
either as a ketone with an -one suffix or as an ester with an -oate suffix, but it can't be named as an -onoate.
Similarly, amino alcohol 2 must be named either as an alcohol (-ol) or as an amine (-amine), but it can't be
named as an -olamine or -aminol.

The only exception to the rule requiring a single suffix is when naming compounds that have double or

triple bonds. Thus, the unsaturated acid                   is 3-butenoic acid, and the acetylenic alcohol

is 5-pentyn-1-ol.

How do we choose which suffix to use? Functional groups are divided into two classes, principal groups and
subordinate groups, as shown in TABLE A2. Principal groups can be cited either as prefixes or as suffixes,
while subordinate groups are cited only as prefixes. Within the principal groups, an order of priority has been

Access for free at openstax.org
                                    A · Nomenclature of Polyfunctional Organic Compounds 1153

established: the proper suffix for a given compound is determined by choosing the principal group of highest
priority. For example, TABLE A2 indicates that keto ester 1 should be named as an ester rather than as a ketone
because an ester functional group is higher in priority than a ketone. Similarly, amino alcohol 2 should be
named as an alcohol rather than as an amine. Thus, the name for 1 is methyl 4-oxopentanoate and the name for
2 is 5-amino-2-pentanol. Further examples are shown:

aPrincipal groups are listed in order of decreasing priority; subordinate groups have no priority order.

Name Part 2. The Parent: Selecting the Main Chain or Ring

The parent, or base, name of a polyfunctional organic compound is usually easy to identify. If the principal
group of highest priority is part of an open chain, the parent name is that of the longest chain containing the
largest number of principal groups. For example, compounds 6 and 7 are isomeric aldehydo amides, which
must be named as amides rather than as aldehydes according to TABLE A2. The longest chain in compound

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                               A · Nomenclature of Polyfunctional Organic Compounds 1155

6 has six carbons, and the substance is named 5-methyl-6-oxohexanamide. Compound 7 also has a chain of
six carbons, but the longest chain that contains both principal functional groups has only four carbons. Thus,
compound 7 is named 4-oxo-3-propylbutanamide.

If the highest-priority principal group is attached to a ring, the parent name is that of the ring system.
Compounds 8 and 9, for instance, are isomeric keto nitriles and must both be named as nitriles according
to TABLE A2. Substance 8 is named as a benzonitrile because the -CN functional group is a substituent
on the aromatic ring, but substance 9 is named as an acetonitrile because the -CN functional group is on
an open chain. Thus, their names are 2-acetyl-(4-bromomethyl)benzonitrile (8) and
(2-acetyl-4-bromophenyl)acetonitrile (9). As further examples, compounds 10 and 11 are both keto acids and
must be named as acids, but the parent name in 10 is that of a ring system (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid)
and the parent name in 11 is that of an open chain (propanoic acid). Thus, their names are
trans-2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (10) and 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoic acid (11).

Name Parts 3 and 4. The Prefixes and Locants

With the parent name and the suffix established, the next step is to identify and give numbers, or locants,
to all substituents on the parent chain or ring. The substituents include all alkyl groups and all functional
groups other than the one cited in the suffix. For example, compound 12 contains three different functional
groups (carboxyl, keto, and double bond). Because the carboxyl group is highest in priority and the longest chain
containing the functional groups has seven carbons, compound 12 is a heptenoic acid. In addition, the parent
chain has a keto (oxo) substituent and three methyl groups. Numbering from the end nearer the highest-priority
functional group gives the name (E)-2,5,5-trimethyl-4-oxo-2-heptenoic acid. Look back at some of the other
compounds we've named to see other examples of how prefixes and locants are assigned.

Writing the Name

With the name parts established, the entire name can be written out. Several additional rules apply:
1. Order of prefixes. When the substituents have been identified, the parent chain has been numbered, and

     the proper multipliers such as di- and tri- have been assigned, the name is written with the substituents
     listed in alphabetical, rather than numerical, order. Multipliers such as di- and tri- are not used for
1156 A · Nomenclature of Polyfunctional Organic Compounds

     alphabetization, but the italicized prefixes iso- and sec- are used.

2. Use of hyphens; single- and multiple-word names. The general rule is to determine whether the parent
      is itself an element or compound. If it is, then the name is written as a single word; if it isn't, then
      the name is written as multiple words. Methylbenzene is written as one word, for instance, because the
      parent--benzene--is a compound. Diethyl ether, however, is written as two words because the
      parent--ether--is a class name rather than a compound name. Some further examples follow:

3. Parentheses. Parentheses are used to denote complex substituents when ambiguity would otherwise arise.
      For example, chloromethylbenzene has two substituents on a benzene ring, but (chloromethyl)benzene has
      only one complex substituent. Note that the expression in parentheses is not set off by hyphens from the
      rest of the name.
