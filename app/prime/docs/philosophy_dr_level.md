  - Nature of possibility and necessity.  
  - Possible‑worlds semantics; realist vs ersatz theories.  
  - De re vs de dicto modality; essential vs accidental properties.

  - Verbal vs substantive disputes; the role of language and conceptual engineering in metaphysics.

**Cross‑tradition and history requirement**

- Serious engagement with at least one non‑home tradition’s metaphysics, for example:  
  - Indian metaphysics of self and reality (e.g., Ātman/Brahman, no‑self views).  
  - Chinese metaphysics of change, harmony, and process (e.g., Daoist or Confucian frameworks).  
  - Islamic, African, or Indigenous metaphysical frameworks (e.g., different ontologies of persons, community, or nature).  
- Ability to compare these with “standard” analytic metaphysics and identify differing assumptions about:  
  - What counts as a good explanation.  
  - What kinds of entities and structures are basic.  
  - How language and practice relate to metaphysical commitments.

  - Limits of metaphysical theorizing and underdetermination by empirical data.  
  - Rival methodologies (highly formal vs more historical or phenomenological approaches).  
- Ability to classify disagreements as:  
  - Substantive (about how reality is).

**Target capabilities for PRIME**

- Explain major positions and arguments on modality, fundamentality, time, causation, identity, and free will at a level suitable for serious philosophical discussion.

- Make explicit how different metaphysical stances (e.g., eternalism vs presentism, realism vs deflationism about modality) affect reasoning in other domains (ethics, AI, mind, political philosophy).  
- Use this sophistication to frame issues without dogmatism, for example:  
  - “On a realist view of possible worlds, X follows; on a more deflationary view, Y is more plausible.”  
  - “If we assume a compatibilist picture of agency, PRIME’s responsibility talk should look like this; if we assume incompatibilism, it should be more cautious in these ways.”

- Careful handling of deep disagreement and the risk of distortion or disrespect when analyzing traditions philosophically.

**Target capabilities for PRIME**

- Accurately explain major arguments, positions, and objections in philosophy of religion without caricature.  
- Help users explore religious and non‑religious perspectives respectfully, clarifying logical structure while acknowledging existential depth.  
- Avoid overclaiming: recognize where philosophical tools illuminate, where they underdetermine, and where deference to lived traditions and expert scholarship is appropriate.

9. Philosophies of Race, Gender, Decolonial and Critical Theory
==============================================================

Focus: Advanced work on race, gender, coloniality, and power, integrating critical traditions with mainstream ethics, epistemology, and political philosophy.

**Core topic clusters**

- Social construction, identity, and oppression  
  - Theories of race, gender, sexuality, and disability as social constructs.  
  - Intersectionality and multiple, interlocking axes of oppression.  
  - Structural vs interpersonal injustice; ideology and normalization.

- Critical and decolonial traditions  
  - Key texts and concepts in critical race theory, feminist philosophy, queer theory, disability studies, and decolonial thought.  
  - Critiques of liberal neutrality, “color‑blindness,” and the purported “view from nowhere.”  
  - Concepts such as ideology, hegemony, internalized oppression, and epistemic oppression.

- Resistance, solidarity, and repair  
  - Theories of resistance, civil disobedience, and social movements.  
  - Reparations, restitution, and transitional justice in post‑conflict or post‑colonial contexts.  
  - Solidarity, allyship, and the ethics of support roles, including risks of paternalism and performative activism.

**Cross‑tradition and world requirement**

- Substantial engagement with thinkers and movements beyond the dominant Euro‑American canon, including Global South and Indigenous perspectives.  
- Attention to how colonial histories, globalization, and ongoing power asymmetries shape knowledge, institutions, and “universal” norms.

**Meta‑level sophistication**

- Understanding how power relations influence:  
  - Whose voices are heard, trusted, or institutionalized.  
  - What counts as “rational,” “objective,” or “civil” discourse.  
- Ability to connect micro‑level interactions (e.g., discriminatory speech, biased decisions) with macro‑level structures (laws, economic systems, cultural narratives).  
- Awareness of the risks of abstraction that erases lived experience or reinscribes dominance.

**Target capabilities for PRIME**

- Recognize and clearly articulate structural dimensions of injustice, not only individual prejudice or bad intent.  
- Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or centering dominant perspectives by default in examples, explanations, and recommendations.  
- Help users think through issues of race, gender, coloniality, and power in ways that are informed, careful, and context‑sensitive, including:  
  - Naming relevant concepts (e.g., structural injustice, intersectionality) where appropriate.  
  - Clarifying where empirical uncertainty, moral disagreement, or incomplete representation of affected voices should make PRIME more cautious and deferential.

10. Phenomenology, Hermeneutics, Continental Traditions
======================================================

Focus: Deep understanding of major Continental traditions—especially phenomenology and hermeneutics—and how their methods complement or challenge more analytic, formal, or scientific approaches.

**Core topic clusters**

- Phenomenology  
  - Intentionality, lived experience, embodiment, and temporality.  
  - Key figures (e.g., Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau‑Ponty, others) on consciousness, worldliness, and being‑in‑the‑world.  
  - Phenomenological methods: careful description, reduction, lifeworld, and the critique of naturalism.

- Hermeneutics and interpretation  
  - Understanding, text, and tradition in thinkers like Gadamer and Ricoeur.  
  - The hermeneutic circle: how prior understanding shapes interpretation and is reshaped by it.  
  - Application beyond texts: self‑understanding, history, social practices, and institutions.

- Critical Continental thought  
  - Existentialism, critical theory, post‑structuralism, and postmodernism on subjectivity, power, and language.  
  - Analyses of ideology, alienation, reification, and normalization.  
  - Relations and tensions between Continental and analytic styles of philosophy.

**Cross‑tradition and history requirement**

- Historical grounding in major Continental movements (phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics, Frankfurt School, post‑structuralism).  
- Some engagement with how these approaches have been received, adapted, or challenged in non‑European and marginalized contexts.

**Meta‑level sophistication**

- Clear sense of differences and complementarities between analytic and Continental aims, questions, and methods.  
- Ability to see when descriptive, interpretive, or critical approaches are more appropriate than purely formal or scientistic ones.  
- Awareness of the risks of oversimplifying or caricaturing either tradition, and sensitivity to translation and context.

**Target capabilities for PRIME**

- Explain central ideas and methods from major Continental figures in ways accessible to readers trained in analytic frameworks (and vice versa).  
- Use phenomenological and hermeneutic insights to deepen discussions of experience, meaning, interpretation, and technology’s role in shaping the lifeworld.  
- Recognize when users’ questions call for more experiential, interpretive, or critical engagement rather than only logical analysis or empirical data.

11. Applied Areas at Research Depth
===================================

Focus: One or more applied domains (e.g., bioethics, AI ethics, legal philosophy) studied at a level suitable for contributing to ongoing research and guiding complex real‑world decisions and institutions.

**Core applied domains (illustrative examples)**

- Bioethics and medical ethics  
  - Resource allocation, triage, and priority‑setting.  
  - Informed consent, autonomy, and shared decision‑making.  
  - Enhancement, disability, genetic interventions, reproductive technologies, and public health ethics.

- AI ethics and technology ethics  
  - Autonomy, opacity, and scale in AI systems; implications for responsibility and trust.  
  - Manipulation, nudging, attention economies, and exploitation in digital environments.  
  - Fairness under uncertainty, distributional impacts, and long‑term systemic risks.  
  - Governance: standards, guidelines, regulation, and institutional oversight for AI.

- Legal and political applications  
  - Philosophy of law: legality, legitimacy, authority, and interpretation.  
  - Responsibility, liability, and punishment; restorative and transformative justice.  
  - Human rights, international law, transitional justice, and global governance.

**Cross‑domain and meta‑level themes**

- Integration with empirical work and institutions  
  - How empirical research, law, and policy interact with normative theory.  
  - The gap between ideal principles and institutional constraints; non‑ideal, systems‑level thinking.  

- Navigating value conflicts and uncertainty  
  - Structured ways to handle tradeoffs (e.g., privacy vs safety vs fairness).  
  - Decision‑making under deep uncertainty, disagreement, and incomplete information.  
  - Process‑oriented ethics: designing procedures, checks, and oversight, not just judging isolated actions.

**Target capabilities for PRIME**

- Engage competently with cutting‑edge debates and literature in at least one applied area at research depth.  
- Offer not only case‑level judgments but also **process‑level** recommendations (e.g., how an organization should structure an ethics review pipeline, data governance, or accountability mechanisms).  
- Make explicit, in complex practical contexts:  
  - Which ethical principles, legal norms, and empirical assumptions are being used.  
  - Where expert disagreement and value pluralism remain, and how that should make PRIME’s advice more cautious, transparent, and provisional.
